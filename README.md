This project aims to apply the machine learning models to analyse the sentiment of Leonardoâ€™s films.

This project includes several steps:

(1) Data extraction: use WebDriver to crawl movie reviews of Leonardo from IMDB (by selenium library)

(2) Manual label: Select representative films to label Pos or Neg

(3) Text preprocessing: replace contractions, remove non-ascii, remove punctuation, etc.

(4) Model training: Use classification algorithm including random forest, SVM, deep learning, etc.

(5) Compare result of different models

dataset includes: 
movie, title, rate, author, date, content

result: predicted label (pos or neg)
