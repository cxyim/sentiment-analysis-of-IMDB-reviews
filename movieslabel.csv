theBeach,Do not miss this movie just because of its low rating,10/10,icysky44,5/7/2005,"Recently a friend of mine watched ""The Beach"" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e. ""Never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never cease to be polite, and never outstay your welcome""). He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie.

theBeach,The Beach WILL NOT DIE TODAY,8/10,ecwjedi,14/6/2005,"The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today.",pos
theBeach,Unfairly Panned; A Good Movie,9/10,ccthemovieman-1,25/10/2006,"Here is another of those films that got panned by critics all over the place, but I liked the movie and thought it was unfairly criticized.

Two things are not up for debate: the film is entertaining and the cinematography is gorgeous.

Leonardo DiCaprio's lead character is not particularly likable, but that's nothing new for him. He's good at playing the boyish, cocky immature type. He's also good at narration, which he provides here, as he has in a number of other films. In fact, I wish there were more of it in here.

French actress Virginie Ledoyen is a new face to me, and a pretty one. I found her intriguing, and not just because of her face Actually, all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.

The scenery from Thailand is magnificent. By the way, ""the beach"" that's in this film really exists, just as it's seen here. The story is interesting, too, for the full two hours. My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language, particularly with all the f-words.

Don't listen to those national critics who blasted this. I think you'll be entertained.",pos
theBeach,"Pretty good, despite all the bad reviews I've read",7/10,stamper,4/6/2000,"I went to this one, knowing that it could be crap, but hey, I do not care what others think and once again this way of thinking did not prove me wrong.

This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself, because he wants to forget his past. There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.

After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.

This is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.

Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.

NO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!

theBeach,"If you travel, you'll understand",8/10,emilyzongqi37,12/2/2011,"When you travel, you are surrounded by people. Amidst all that foreign intrigue, you are truly alone - an opportunity to be truthful to your instincts.

When you are young and you travel, recklessness and the need to experience drive almost all your decision, well other than budgetary constraints.

It is therefore quite truthful at times to relate to the character who is in search of this ultimate freedom, a place where all your worldly obligations are suspended and irrelevant.

The movie is an irony. Not only externally, that though it depicts the end purity of nature when fox's being sued for environmental damage, but also that any man-found paradise is not free, but with a price and in this case, could be the ultimate price.

I truly enjoyed the movie especially at times the sparks of life's insight and moments of traveller's consciousness that when you are there, in that destination, IT becomes reality and no longer are you foreign and problems arise regardless.

Though the romance is distracting, Etienne, Canet's portrayal is quite the eye candy.

Definitely a watch, but may not appeal to all tastes.",pos
theBeach,Why did it get such bad reviews here?,8/10,MossMan,4/12/2001,"This is one of the few times that I have been badly mislead by the reviews on IMDb! I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good ""soft"" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).

What a revelation! I understand that people who have read the book may be disappointed, but as an uneducated viewer this is a fantastic film! Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.

And I *liked* the fact that the film made a few surprising changes in style... I hate knowing the end of a story at least an hour before it finally grinds its inevitable way there (see any ""action"" film).",pos
theBeach,An amazing film,10/10,spyqueen,12/2/2000,"Danny Boyle did an exquisite job on this film. When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his ""original"" cast members... the people that he always works with. When I learned that Robert Carlyle was in this, I was ecstatic. This film has so many wonderful points, I can't list them all. I'm just going to say that ""enjoy your dinner Richard"" was a classic cinematic moment. A great thing about this film is that it's a wonderful representation of a microcosm of todays society. It shows that no matter how hard you try to escape all the wrongs in life, and all of your daily annoyances, they'll still be there no matter where you escape to. This film doesn't go from beginning to end. It circles. There is no ending because their lives didn't end. Truly a supreme film. It is what one should expect from a man like Danny Boyle. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another amazing performance. It takes a wonderful actor to be able to portray an emotion such as insanity just with his eyes, and he did so wonderfully!

theBeach,Read the Book,1/10,cat-12,20/2/2000,"Well - Where do I start... A classic story written by Alex Garland - Destroyed by Danny Boyle & co. It would take a long time to pick my way through the debris of this particular shambles so I shall narrow it down to what I see as the main critical flaws that sank Leo's latest water borne epic 1. The movie has been aimed squarely at a teen market hence you get style over content - The beautiful people in paradise hanging out with a highly commercial soundtrack and a Top Shop tie in on the fashion side

2. The removal of the deep cynicism evident in Garlands novel - Read the book - you will find it very hard to find a sympathetic character.

3. Richards(Leo) fascination with the whole 'Nam pop culture - this is throw in as an afterthought in the last 25 minutes of the film(apart from a fleeting glimpse of Apocalypse Now in the opening reel)and falls completely flat - what we get is comical( check out Leo as he does his best Cat. Willard impressions - hilarious!

4. The love interest. Okay - this I can understand purely for its commercial reasons - it has a bums on seats factor. But it damages a vital part of the book - Richard never gets it together with Francois let alone Sal hence there is an unspoken tension in the air which adds to Richards isolation and his descent into 'Nam paranoia. Enough! If you want the real experience read the book - if you want a very cheap facsimile go see Leo and the gang...3/10",neg
theBeach,An unpleasant and frustrating experience,4/10,masonmorgan-92917,29/11/2016,"Danny Boyle's The Beach was an awful viewing experience for me and thinking back on it is just as unpleasant, so naturally I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about it.

The reason that The Beach is so awful is because it is so pretentious and full of itself. It gives a painfully obvious and blatant expression on a social commentary that feels so forced.

The Beach is also extremely boring. I was patiently waiting for the movie to pick up, but after an hour of pure nothing, I gave up hope and assumed that the rest of the film would be just as uneventful. Sadly, I was right.

The Beach feels like a 2-hour long Expedia commercial. The music is cheap and terribly cheesy and the cinematography is sometimes interesting, but mostly just dull.

Leonardo DiCaprio did give an entertaining performance even though he did overact quite a bit. Tilda Swinton wasn't bad either, but the rest of the cast is just so forgettable and boring that it even weighs down these two characters. Robert Carlyle was one of the few redeemable aspects of The Beach. His character was utterly mad and it seemed that he loved playing this character, which made him a blast to watch.

The story is painfully slow. We have to endure long stretches of Leo's character expressing his obsession for a girl he barely knows, then we are suddenly treated to a horrifically graphic shark attack scene. The tone of The Beach is never established. Most of the movie is extremely depressing and generally uncomfortable to watch, but then the movie ends on a gleefully happy note as if nothing bad even happened.

The best way I can explain The Beach is that it is a confused, hyper mess of a film that tackles a social commentary so blatantly obvious that it comes off grossly pretentious. And any time Danny Boyle tries to have fun, it comes off as just awkward.

While The Beach does have a passionate cult following, I simply cannot find enjoyment in the film myself. It's dull, pretentious and just messy. I respect Danny Boyle as a film maker but I really don't know what he was hoping to achieve with this one. I'm just grateful that the whole experience was completely forgettable. Another trip to this mind- numbing ""paradise"" wouldn't be good for my sanity.",neg
theBeach,"""The Beach"" - An experience",9/10,prashanthmn,7/5/2007,":Trust Me, Its Paradise

'The Beach' is a kinda of movie the feel of which surrounds you slowly and completely.

I'd say Danny Boyle has done complete justification to the book. The movie captures the essence of the book. I watched the movie first and then read the book. The beach can be better experienced thru the movie. The music (by Angelo Badalamenti) is excellent, but unfortunately not popular( which is why I believe popular is not always the best ;-)). DiCaprio proves how versatile and powerful he is as an actor. A must watch for DiCaprio fans. Purchase an original DVD and you'll get to see alternate beginning and alternate climax of the movie with director's comments. You will like this movie especially if you are a crazy traveler and like to explore unseen and untouched places.

Direction, location, music and DiCaprio are the strengths of the movie. 'The Beach' is not just a movie, its an experience.

:never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience........",pos
theBeach,Horrible stuff..,1/10,carloshache,15/4/2006,"Entertaining in parts, but as a whole it's pure manure.

This movie is generally about the sociopath Richard( DiCaprio),in his elitist pursuit of pleasure, sex and holiday paradise. He goes to great length in pursuing this, using lies, deceit and violence to get what he wants. He gets to know about a secluded Thai beach, and makes friends with a french guy and his girlfriend in order to steal the girlfriend from the guy.. The trio finds their ""paradise"" on an island that's part occupied by some armed and crazy Thai marijuana farmers, and the other part; a crazy hippie collective . The hippies are driven by a collective fear of getting their tropical paradise discovered, so they use fascistic methods when silencing members of the society to not reveal the secrets of the whereabouts of their beautiful beach/self made tropical paradise ""community"".

The hippie commune, is still a slave to consumerism society, and not the alternative society that it is set out to be. Just like Richard, the members of the community goes to great length in defending their right to ""fun"" and ""pleasure"", taking a blind fold to the ones that get hurt and killed in their pursuit. The goal of the commune is elitist and fascist, the means of using violence is motivated by keeping out other tourists and people the commune doesn't want out of this beach-resort. Richard makes everything he can to do the same things. He is everything that goes bad with the commune inpersonated.. He's not able to feel any empathy or understanding for anyone, the only time he openly questions the fascism of the commune is when his own life is on the line in order to save it. In other cases he walks away, and still ""feels good being in paradise"".

Well the movies meaning wasn't supposed to be about this. The director somehow thought that we should see any kind of sympathy and actually care about what happens to Richard, and forgive him for his actions, instead he is the only guy in this movie that is actually disgustingly inhumane. Maybe he thought we should have been blazed by the star quality of Di Caprio. But truthfully, He is nothing more than a stupid parody of idiotic travellers who think they can behave anyhow they like in any foreign exotic location. The unintentional satire is exaggerating this, making him a total psychopath. He is not just a someone who quietly takes orders, the nazi-like leader of the commune; Sal is his peer. The same person, but with power.

DiCaprios character is somebody you would want the director to have shot off early in the movie. Even if it was the meaning of the director to show DiCaprio as a total a-hole, this a-hole definitely isn't good company for the two hours. This is not the only bad thing about the movie. It's slow scenes, extremely bad computer animations and the horribly outdated brit-pop soundtrack makes it an equally painful experience to watch.

The movies ending is nothing but Richard being nostalgic about his beach adventures in his normal-life setting, not having learned any lesson or gained any emotional strength. The viewer is also encouraged to join his nostalgia for his blood stained paradise.

Why go to such great lengths anyway to get away from the mass tourists? Go to the Philipines or any place that isn't as crowded as Thailand. Stupid movie.",neg
theBeach,Cult movie potential,8/10,Dockelektro,1/2/2002,"Like the many times referenced ""Apocalypse Now"", this one could really reach the status of cult movie among the nature lovers and hippy heirs. The movie its all the perfect spots during the first half. The beach, the people, the rhythm, the actors, the music... all is stunning. They even sing Bob Marley by the fire. But the film's second half is strange, erratic, scattered, it leaves the awe-inspiring journey sense and centers in a strange and sudden ""mood"" by DiCaprio's Richard. This is where the letdown is fully, although the ending doesn't feel disappointing. As for the cult movie potential, I think the next generations must judge it, but it has a great deal of bitterness to it and if two years later the film isn't a ""word of mouth"" phenomenon, maybe it won't have such a cult afterall. Anyway, I thought it was a great work by the scottish team of ""Trainspotting"", the script is an asset, and I say it again, DiCaprio is not just a pretty face. Recomend it to all people from 18 up. Live it and think about it. I sure liked it anyway...

theBeach,After 16 years I just recently saw this...,7/10,AlsExGal,11/12/2016,"... and I thought it was a pretty good film. When it first came out it was DiCaprio's presence that caused me not to watch it, and after watching him grow as an actor over the last 15 years, DiCaprio is what got me curious enough to give it a try.

DiCaprio plays Richard, a tourist who hates the tourist traps he can afford in Thailand. A guy in Richard's hotel named Daffy -for appropriate reasons - kills himself, but first draws a map to an island that he claims is nirvana. Richard convinces two French tourists to come with him and they actually do find a colony of people living outside of any civilization other than the one they have built for their own survival and pleasure. The leader is Sal (Tilda Swinton) who tells the three that the drug dealers who control the island allow them to stay there but have said there can be no more people joining them - it hurts their chances at having their thriving cannabis business remain undiscovered. Sal says that they can stay, but is bothered by the map, burns it, and asks if they gave a copy to anyone else. Richard lies and says no - he gave it to a group of stoners he met before they got there. Whether they are on their way there or are too drug addled to make the trip, Richard does not know. So he figures the lie will hurt nobody.

This is basically an adult ""Lord of the Flies"". The lesson it teaches is that no matter where you go, unfortunately your human nature and all that comes with it hitches a ride. That is why Richard could easily see the evils of the city but it took some time for problems to arise at ""the beach"". It's just a matter of more humans in one place than another.

And who would figure on a story in which armed drug dealers actually turn out to be the good guys, probably because they know the truth about human nature better than their nirvana seeking neighbors. To see what I mean, watch and find out.",pos
theBeach,"Backpacking in Thailand, oh yeah! :))",8/10,Juli-4,14/4/2002,"When I was travelling in Thailand, everyone was talking about the ""Beach"" and all backpackers aimed for its filming location, Koh Phi Phi. Although I watched a lot of good movies in the touristic cafes on Khao San Road in Bangkok and in Penang, Malaysia, I missed the ""Beach"" and came home wondering what it was all about. I finally saw it yesterday and in spite of a couple of flaws, I genuinely enjoyed it! First of all, it really shows the atmosphere of Thailand - the golden Buddha, the tiny rooms with thin partitions in the guesthouses, the markets, the internet cafes, the tourists' clothes and their very behavior... Second, the landscape is amazing, Leonardo is quite good, although he's had better movies in his career, but he's definitely very convincing in this role, and the girl playing Francois is quite charming. Also, the movie is funny! Third, this movie has a great moral message. Following the tradition of ""Lord of the Flies"" and others, it shows the dangers of separated communities, the disappearance of rules, regrets, the little value human life has in extreme situations, the dangers of a despotic ruler. It shows that the longed-for paradise might not actually be that easy to live in.",pos
theBeach,Hard to Sympathise,1/10,kabza,8/4/2013,"The Beach was a novel I originally read by Alex Garland - the movie was watched not long after. My tendency for movies not living up to the books they were based on were accounted for in the writing and rating of this review.

The main character is a short tempered, deluded, murderous, integrity-lacking wimp. It is hard to empathise with someone who loses their cool over minuscule things. In fact, the reactions from all the characters to situations they are exposed too seem highly unwarranted and excessive, aka ""over-acting"".

Secondly, did they really have to turn Richard - who was a somewhat intellectual character in the book - to an ignorant bimbo? This movie seems like it was targeted to brainless sixteen year olds.

Furthermore, you don't really relate to nor care much for someone who cheats on the woman he loves so easily right after helping her cheat on her boyfriend who was your friend. I almost hoped the movie would have a twist ending where he really did get his brains blown out.",neg
theBeach,As Appealing As A Trip To The Beach On A Rainy Day,4/10,Theo Robertson,10/12/2007,"Ah backpacking across the world . What an exciting thing it is - but only if you're a rare and remarkable person . Travelling all over the world isn't all it's cracked up to be . You might get a one night stand , you might get stoned but to be honest couldn't you have got that at home ? Did you really need to go the ends of the earth for that ? If you're a rare remarkable person you'll also get altitude sickness , suffer dysentery , catch ringworm and under go a rabies scare . You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical disease

THE BEACH is very similar in many ways . It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisation

Take one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart . Did anyone like the characters in this movie ? Neither did I . I haven't read Garland's novel but I'm led to believe there's a scene where a giant squid is washed up on the beach and the characters eat it only to end up with food poisoning . I would have enjoyed this movie much more if all the characters had died from food poisoning . When you watch a movie and the most likable character is a mad mental foul mouthed dope smoking Scotsman then you know the producers have got a problem

Another thing I had problems with is the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character Richard suddenly turns from inquisitive backpacker into Colonel Kurtz . Something similar happens in another Boyle movie 28 DAYS LATER but at least in that movie you're aware of the character's motive even if it is fairly unconvincing . Here you do find yourself wondering the explanation ended up on the cutting room floor or even if it was excluded at draft stage . Not only that but you find that the characters remain unchanged by events at the end therefore there is zero character development

Danny Boyle has said that he makes quintessential British films and it's difficult to disagree with him . TRAINSPOTTING has a strong feel of time and place while 28 DAYS LATER mirrors the British apocalypse writers of the 1950s . THE BEACH with its exotic foreign location and its American star definitely feels like it's made for an American audience and Boyle tries too hard to pander to their taste . That's why THE BEACH is probably Boyle's weakest film to date",neg
theBeach,Did we really expect something better?,1/10,Sam-71,21/2/2000,"Once again, Hollywood has managed to lower the benchmark for a bad movie even further. This was such a bad movie that I felt myself constantly looking at my watch. I didn't even have to pay for it - but I still felt as though I had wasted 2 hours of my life.

The plot was terrible, and was so over the place that sometimes it just wasn't clear what was happening. The character development was non-existent. It was not clear why the characters did what they did and why they had become what they were.

**** Little spoiler ahead****

And when Leo went ""wild"", I was totally confused. Why? How? He just sudden;y turned into a savage and started running around the forest making traps and eating bugs. Plus the flash backs to the guy who gave him the map - were they dreams? Drug induced? Or did he have some tropical fever??????

The whole thing was so unrealistic that is was just pathetic. Leo can act, but it seems that all the budget was spent on him, and that they just pulled some backpackers off the street of Bangcok and said ""Do you wanna be in a movie?"". The only redeeming thing about this film was that the cinematograpgy was pretty good.

****Spolier ahead!*****

Another thing that bothered me was the shark scene. I'm sorry, but a whole lagoon would NOT fill up with blood if a shark attacked 2 or 3 people. Plus the shark itself was HORRIBLE! I haven't seen such a bad shark for ages!! The whole theatre laughed!!! It looked like a piece of painted foam. They should have borrowed the ""Jaws"" set from Universal or something.

This movie was so bad that it is not ever worth seeing. It was like MTV meets ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Apocolypse Now"" - taking the worst elements of each. You'd be better off using 2 hours of your life in any other way.",neg
theBeach,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the beach, this pops up.",2/10,twotrybe,7/11/2009,"I could not sit through this film. Maybe it's British sensibility but I quickly found the voice over narration totally annoying. As the character went through the pacing, I found myself not really caring about him. What a blow hard and naive little puppy. I do not fault Di Caprio's part but I do fault the writing. There is no logic in why this person does what he does unless he's a complete idiot. They walk into a field of marijuana like they are taking a leisurely stroll through Busch Gardens. Parts of Jamaica is like this and the tourist boards knows that. You can't go into certain parts of the island because there are marijuana fields under armed control. And with this film, everything is telegraphed with emotions. There are no surprises and common sense apparently is in extreme short supply. To say that I deplored this is an understatement as it became an insult to the intelligence of even a 5th grader.

theBeach,Travel Narrows the Mind Wonderfully,7/10,JamesHitchcock,17/8/2005,"Ever since (at least) the eighteenth century, with its cult of the ""noble savage"", tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth. This view is often reflected in the cinema, in films such as ""The Blue Lagoon"" or the various versions of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of ""Lord of the Flies"", like the William Golding novel on which they are based, offer an ironic twist on this theme; a tropical island is used as the setting for an anti-Utopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.

""The Beach"" has certain similarities to ""Lord of the Flies"". The main character is Richard, an American backpacker travelling round Thailand, who has heard tales of a co-operative multi-national community of idealistic young people living on a beach on an island off the coast. Richard has dismissed these tales as mere urban legends, but changes his mind when another backpacker, Daffy, gives him a map showing where the mysterious beach can be found. Undeterred by the fact that Daffy commits suicide shortly afterwards, Richard sets out to go there accompanied by Etienne and Francoise, a young French couple whom he has befriended.

After a number of adventures, the three succeed in reaching the island and discover that the fabled community is no urban myth but a reality. At first they are welcomed into the group and spend their days leading a seemingly idyllic lifestyle, consisting of a small amount of time spent in fishing and large amounts of time spent in playing volleyball or beach cricket, lazing about smoking pot, or (for some obscure reason) translating various English phrases into Serbo-Croat. As with all films of this type, however, we quickly realise that this life is less perfect than it seems. Sexual tensions arise when Richard finds himself increasingly attracted to Francoise and she deserts her boyfriend Etienne for him. More seriously, there are flaws in the basic concept of the community.

The main flaw is that travel narrows the mind wonderfully. The community, mostly Westerners, have dropped out of their own societies and travelled halfway around the world to Thailand, but find Thai society no more congenial than those they have left behind. Their solution is to drop out of that too and to set up a ""beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts"" where they can live their own hedonistic idea of the hippie life. The community is not, however self-sufficient; they produce little for themselves, apart from fish, and have to import many of their supplies from the mainland, which they pay for by growing and selling cannabis. The island, in fact, is owned by a group of Thai farmers, themselves involved in a much larger cannabis-producing operation, who are happy to tolerate the newcomers provided they keep their community a secret and do not try to attract new recruits.

As in many anti-Utopian parables, the community is dominated by a sinister dictator-figure. ""Lord of the Flies"" had the choirboy Jack, ""Animal Farm"" had Napoleon and ""The Beach"" has Sal, an upper-class Englishwoman who is accepted as the leader of the community (although it is never clear how she attained this position). Sal is obsessed with protecting the community's privacy and secrecy, and in order to achieve this end she is prepared to resort to violence, even murderous violence. (She is deeply suspicious of Richard, who she suspects may have distributed further copies of Daffy's map). One of the film's most chilling incidents comes after Christo, one of the group, is seriously injured after being attack by a shark. He can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment, but because this might result in the community's existence being revealed to outsiders, Sal refuses to permit this and Christo is left to die.

There is some good acting in the film, especially from Tilda Swinton who gives a nicely judged performance as Sal, a woman with steely eyes and a cut-glass accent who for most of the movie can seem threatening without ever issuing any direct threats or even raising her voice. This increases the impact of the scene at the end where Sal finally does lose her cool. The beautiful Virginie Ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected Francoise, and I also liked Guillaume Canet as Etienne. Originally seen as a loser, the man who loses his girlfriend to Richard, Etienne later emerges as the community's voice of conscience, the one man who refuses to abandon the dying Christo.

It was, however, unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle, who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard, was overruled by the studio, as Leonardo di Caprio, although he is better here than he was in ""Titanic"", tends to overact. The film tends to deteriorate in the second half, with the plot becoming difficult to follow as Richard, alienated from his fellow-members of the group, starts to become mentally unstable. The style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes, and the sequence where Richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric.

theBeach,Getting away from it all may not be perfection paradise after all?,8/10,Spikeopath,4/3/2008,"I first viewed this film upon its release and felt that the final third did the film down - and that the voice-over took away from the essence of the story, thus it's average. My subsequent viewings over the years would see me lament about an arcade game sequence and bemoaning that Robert Carlyle wasn't given a more extended role, yet it has become a film that sees me totally on board with director Danny Boyle's production and it's now that I think it puts the story together with poignant precision.

Leonardo DiCaprio is Richard, a backpacker searching for a bit more in life, after a meeting with pot smoking loony Daffy (the wonderful Robert Carlyle), he learns of an island paradise that is everything he has yearned for in his life. Getting there will give him the adventure and danger he craves, because once there it apparently will be the thing of dreams, the perfect paradise cut off from civilisation...

The film is very much split in two, the first half introduces us to Richard and the people he would convince to travel with him to this island paradise, we then follow their journey that is perfect in fleshing out the characters, they come up against obstacles and learn about each other on the way. The second half is well worth waiting for because it's here that the story kicks in to make the viewer think, it's idyllic, it's gorgeous, it's near perfect, but wherever there is a community, there will be personal hang ups, jealousies, power seekers and etc, in short, the surroundings may be perfect but the human condition is far from flawless.

I love this film now, I love DiCaprio's performance, a cocky smart- arse thrill seeker about to get a wake up call is tailor made for him, and he delivers it with a skillful array of emotions. Director Danny Boyle does a great job of juggling the joys of paradise with the uneasy distortion of the various characters in the community, and the cinematography from Darius Khondji is truly beautiful (Thailand locales). The film suffers with the inevitable comparisons to Lord Of The Flies & Hearts Of Darkness, and yes these are fair comparisons, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's a fine film for the modern generation in its own right, with the core point of the story relevant to all and sundry.

Fans of the novel would prove to be very ambivalent towards this filmic adaptation, but in my book it gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10",pos
theBeach,Garbage,1/10,sugar_daddyo,8/4/2006,"Has anyone actually paid to see this movie? whether in the theater or renting the movie? I caught it channel surfing one night and paused only long enough to figure out what I was watching and recall why I hate Leo. The only reason I am even wasting my time to write a review is because someone needs to counter the endless stream of 9s and 10s on this sight. If you ask me, this only degrades the quality of IMDb.

As for the reality, it is not even close. I spent two years in the tropics and life is very hard. You are sunburnt all the time, not tan, and sick from the monotony of the food, tropical diseases and storms. ***Spoiler follows*** watching Leo spear a dozen fish on his first try followed by a macho, ""I provide!"" moved something within me that I didn't know existed :{D= ***End of Spoiler***

theBeach,Lacking all the elements a movie needs!,3/10,Xophianic,13/2/2000,"I didn't want to see this movie in the first place; I just went because of two things. One is for my love of movies, and the other is because my girlfriend really wanted to see it. By the end of this movie, we both agreed that it was the crappiest movie we'd seen (at least in theaters) in a long time. THE BEACH lacked all the elements that I look for in a movie and that I think makes a movie important. I was really tempted to sneak out of that stupid movie and go see THE TIGGER STORY!

Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young dope-addicted traveler who is trying to forget his past, meets a psycho named Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a beautiful island/beach paradise before committing suicide. Richard, along with two more dope-addicts, Sal (Tilda Swinton) and Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), set out to find this beach. What they find is a community living together without the evils of the world, struggling to keep their existence a secret so the rest of the world doesn't spoil it. It turns out Richard is the biggest danger to the secret of the community.

Sound like it might have a plot. Think again. This movie is completely plotless. At first, you may think it's a love story between Leonardo and Tilda, but that stop quickly. Then it seems like it is about Leonardo losing his sanity, but that quickly comes to an end as well. Then it seems a may be a fight between the community and another group living on the island, but that's not the case either. You will wait from the start to the end of this movie for the plot to start, but it will never come.

Another element this movie lacks, in fact probably the only element that is left for a movie with no plot, is character development. Leonardo's character in the beginning refuses to talk at all about his past. Godforbid we might actually get to know his character. You'll feel just the same about him in the beginning as you do in the end, with no development at all. The rest of the characters are also boring and don't get much better. The acting is nothing special. Leonardo does a fair job, but the horrible script prevents me from calling his performance anything great.

Unless you're a dedicated Leonardo fan, skip THE BEACH. I found it very long, boring, pointless and not entertaining.",neg
theBeach,on the beach...,3/10,dbdumonteil,20/4/2003,"In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie ""the beach"", mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity, following the huge commercial and artistic success of ""Titanic"". But sadly, it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment.

As far as I'm concerned, I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio, Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach. Actually, my expectation was justified but it only lasts half an hour. When they discover the beach and they adhere to the community, I think the movie could have ended there. The second part (which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark) only plays the role of fill-in and spoils all the movie. Moreover, Danny Boyle eyes a bit too much towards the bloody.

Otherwise, to put it mildly is that the dialogs of ""the beach"" are few inspired sometimes silly and too convenient with the situations. Sometimes, the movie turns out to be too predictable: before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen, you guess that a love story will start between them. And, inevitably, it will cause Canet's jealousy but this jealousy will spread to Ledoyen she learns that DiCaprio had sex with Sal during their stay in Bangkok. Besides, the performance appears quite mixed: Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio. Another thing I noticed: DiCaprio' voice-off doesn't succeed in making the movie gripping as it was the case with Edward Norton in ""Fight Club"".

Then, let's admit it: the end of the movie seems too easy and conventional. You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand: there are sharks, it's not always shiny and Sal, the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel. Let's add that the ""paradise keepers"" will do anything to protect their territory, even to kill...

Nevertheless, the movie enjoys a shiny photography that reflects brilliantly the color of the sea and the beach. Landscapes are magnificient and there's a good original soundtrack which includes Moby's porcelain. But these qualities aren't sufficient enough to save the movie. A disappointing and predictable movie and somewhere unfinished. You can blame Boyle for not revealing the reasons of Daffy's suicide.",neg
theBeach,a faithful adaptation of the book...,1/10,mattwakeman,29/5/2001,"...which is a shame because the book is crap. it purports to tell us all what traveling is like and the wonderous things that happen to us and make us (deep breath for a wonderful americanism) 'grow'.

so what we have is a collection of people who are travelers but have found somewhere lovely and have...ermm...stopped traveling and instead created a lovely little utopian world. with no strife. or worries. or interest. having gone traveling from my point of view this film is utter drek. you go traveling for two reasons 1) to go and see and do different things and 2) to go home again. cos you see, if you dont go home then in fact you are NOT a traveler. you have stopped traveling. you are a traveler no more.

there was more sexual tension in the film then the book (not surprising since the book amazingly had no sexual enmity between all the young 20 somethings) but what the film did miss out on was the strife over the divisions of labour and who had to do what to contribute to the community.

instead, what we get is a collection of badly underwritten annoying people preening and sunning themselves in nice locations. so many people had no characterisation that it just hurt...until you realised how bad some of the others characters were and wished that they were similarly underwritten. it goes nowhere and says nothing. dicapricorn is an horrific actor and does less with the material he is given but the whole film is a shambolic mess. at least the book had the decency to admit that when richard went back to the world that he looked back at his time at the beach as though he was a different person. but no, what we get is leonard looking at a lovely holiday snap...forgetting that two of the people in the picture are dead (and that he killed one of them) or that another one of them pointed a gun at his head. but dont worry, cos it was a life affirming event and richard has 'developed' and 'grown'. well, thats all right then.

lord of the flies for the MTV generation who wouldnt recognise a film that has no minor things like a plot, or story or characterisation or anything really. buy it for someone you hate.",neg
theBeach,"Backpackers find paradise on drug island, and will do anything to preserve their way of life.",5/10,cheesy_beanz,20/3/2006,"HERE BE SPOILERS The Silver Screen adaptation of the popular dystopian backpacker's novel, 'The Beach' is perhaps not the most accurate adaptation of the cult book, which has become required reading for a whole generation of travellers. Parts of the original book are hardly mentioned in the film, while whole sections are completely skipped, such as pseudo soldier Jed, whose massive role in the book is written out of the screenplay completely. Just as plot parts are removed, others are added in their place. Richard's unrequited love of Francoise is replaced by a rapid relationship, ending with an all too strange sex scene on between Sal and Richard. Good natured Sal who only wants to preserve village life, becomes a sexual predator, approaching the level of Sharon Stone, as she entraps Richard in her Black Widow clutches. Etienne takes a minor role upon reaching the beach, swiftly giving up Francoise, and becoming a hermit in the forest with the injured Swede. Many of the more powerful (or more controversial) scenes from the book are cut from the movie, giving the feel that the director was reined in by his funders. References to Vietnam are abbreviated to a single shot of a fan, while Richard's re-accuring dreams about Daffy are replaced by a brief sequence toward the end. Perhaps most shockingly of all, the books surprise ending, truly dystopian in it's screaming climax, is replaced by the rather weaker idea of the inhabitants of the beach sailing away on a homemade raft, and joining modern society for Cyber Cafes and coffee. Perhaps if this film can be seen as a separate entity altogether from it's written counterpart, then it would be a pretty good film. Certainly the CGI beach looks pretty good, the acting is of decent quality and the film is not without it's charms. However if even the director Danny Boyle (of 'Trainspotting' legend) is disappointed with what he made, then perhaps this one is best given a miss, and relying on the book to do the talking.",neg
theBeach,Utter trash,5/10,MovieAddict2016,8/6/2005,"I couldn't believe just how trashy this film is. To be fair the cinematography is good and it has a cool blue-ish tint that gives it a visceral edge -- but that's about it.

The acting is bad. Leo DiCaprio is a great actor when he's given a chance (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Aviator, Catch Me If You Can) but here he's really just doing the whole boy-toy routine -- targeting the younger crowds of females rather than really trying to get into character.

The plot isn't the greatest and the metaphors aren't deep -- the movie seems rather pretentious at times and tries to be heavier and more meaningful than it actually is.

Of interesting note is that Danny Boyle (director of ""Trainspotting"") had a falling-out with star Ewan McGregor over this. McGregor was upset he wasn't cast in the film, and now refuses to film the sequel to ""Trainspotting,"" which is named ""Porno."" Considering that ""The Beach"" is quite easily one of Danny Boyle's worst films and one of the most disappointing pictures of the last decade... why the fuss, Ewan? Be happy you didn't get cast in this stinker.",neg
theBeach,Trouble in paradise.,4/10,michaelRokeefe,4/3/2001,"A young traveler (Leonardo DiCaprio)is intent on taking a vacation different from all others. He meets a French couple in Asia and convinces them to trek with him to a secretive island. Upon their arrival they find the island is as perfectly beautiful as they were told. The island is secluded, but inhabited on one side by a commune and the other by drug dealing farmers.

This film does not live up to the hype, but is a very scenic movie. It will keep the DiCaprio fans happy. Virginie Ledoyen, who plays Francoise, is a natural beauty. She is charming and very easy to like. DiCaprio puts in a very tight performance and his eyes speak volumes. The strongest acting comes from Robert Carlyle (Daffy), who provides the travelers with the map to the island before his suicide.

The movie does contain some manic action and violence, but it takes awhile to get there. Not a total disappointment. Pop a top, kick back and enjoy.",neg

The premise seemed to be that this group of people wanted to live out on the island to be different from society but the cast looked like they were transported directly out of MTV's Spring Break show. All perfect bodies and clothes. The plot jumped around with no apparent purpose and the dialog was difficult to understand. If not for the beautiful scenery, the movie would have no redeeming features!

There is no real style in the movie. It seems to be a bad mixture of ""The blue lagoon"", ""Lord of the flies"" and a music video.

Everytime I thought that the movie was getting better I was disappointed. It could have been a very funny and ironic scene when the hippy dude was playing the guitar at the funeral (I thought about ""Four weddings and a funeral""). But no, Danny Boyle tried to make us believe that the hippy community was really sorry.

And what's the movie about anyway? My suggestion is: Nobody wants to go back working after a great vacation.

theBeach,They came in such of paradise,4/10,son_of_cheese_messiah,9/7/2011,"One of the main problems is the lack of empathy we have with anyone. It is not surprising that we fail to empathise, since the characters have so little empathy for each other. Perhaps the intention is to show a group of middle-class pleasure-seekers as they really are: selfish, narcissistic and cruel, and that their retreat from the world is really an attempt to escape their own petty nastiness.

This is an interesting idea, but director Danny Boyle's technique is not up to the task. Neither is the script. For most of the film, we seem to be watching a travelogue combined with a MTV music video. The self-consciously 'cool' soundtrack detracts rather than enhances the experience. Some cack-handed attempts at drama involve unconvincing arguments which spring out of nowhere, such as the waterfall altercation. The story improves when Di Caprio starts to lose his marbles. This is undermined by Boyle's gimmicky effects, such as the annoying video game sequence.

Of the actors, only Paterson Johnson emerges well. He brings a good deal of likability to the role, something of a relief among the Islanders, and I wish the whole story had revolved around his much more interesting and human character.

In the end,we are left with unanswered questions and a great feeling of dissatisfaction.",neg
theBeach,Utter dreadful piece of toss,1/10,giantkiller,9/8/2003,"What a boring, uninspired piece or crud this movie turned out to be. I just saw it on TV for the first time and can only assume it was made with two types of people in mind. The first are people who have never travelled abroad. The second are people so self absorbed that they don't actually get what travelling is all about, and are so hell bent on getting an experience that they fail to notice the culture right in front of them. Selfish, narsissistic, awful people. Frankly people I don't find worthy of having a movie made about them, and since no one seems to make this sort of observation, I can only assume a movie written and made by just this sort of incapable person. Probably one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. 2/10

theBeach,Good drama,4/10,Quinoa1984,8/3/2000,"Danny Boyle's The Beach is well done because it showcases a pacifist anarchist society (to me that means that its a society that gets along and does whatever they want to do) enclosed in a beautiful beach. It shows what happens in the society, how paradise can be achieved, and how Leonardo DiCaprio is OK after all. DiCaprio gives his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and though I have never been much of a fan of DiCaprio's (AT ALL) I found his teaming up with Trainspotting director Boyle was a good bet. With a slick cameo by Robert Carlyle, this film gets good in my book by skipping all the drama Titanc had, and going straight to the good old fashioned crazy drama.

theBeach,Racist dope story without any sense,1/10,Killer-40,14/1/2000,"The press screening in Germany became a nightmare like some visit at the dentist's. Having been to Thailand six times in my life, I wondered how Danny Boyle would catch one of it's most beautiful sights, the island Phi Phi Leh. Not only did Boyle mix reminiscence to APOCALYPSE NOW (not even managing to quote it's moody fans correctly) and THE DEER HUNTER (the ""Russian Roulette"" scene, but this time with a childish and frightened DiCaprio), he also intertwined a video game with the protagonist running through a virtual jungle. This mix of styles was as empty as the whole plot. No Thai would allow dozens of foreigners to stay on their island for such a long time the way those dope-addicted hippies did. No shark would appear to bite them. No marijuana farmers would shoot them. The only restricted areas in Thailand that equal paradises are on military ground. All the suspense in THE BEACH is based on lies. So it comes as no surprise that the Thais are now blaming the film crew for having destroyed some natural surroundings of the island. Clear as one can see that neither the writer of the novel nor the filmmaker have any understanding of Thailand' true soul, they probably didn't even respect it's natural beauty. So this might be the only parallel to the filming of the masterpiece APOCALYPSE NOW: Wherever an American filmcrew invades, the place is changed to their needs. And they are mostly commercial.

Look for some characters (the French tourist, Swinton's boyfriend) and see their figures stuck in the story. Nothing develops. This movie is like a sketchbook and will not even work as a DiCaprio vehicle because most of the other male actors in the movie look better and more manly than him.",neg
theBeach,Could there anything worth watching this movie for...,1/10,bytheseaside,27/12/2004,"Seeing Leonardo DiCaprio without a shirt. That's about it. He does make a nice piece of eye candy.

The rest of the movie is a disturbing piece of utter rubbish. I watched the first two Blade movies before I watched this. I don't know - maybe I'd reached my quota of senseless violence for the day, but whatever happened that movie set me on an edge and it wasn't a good one.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't bother. It missed any message it was trying to convey, which might have still been all right, but it lacked any real plot or characterisation.

I haven't read the book, which is probably a pity, because it is supposed to be better, but I don't have the stomach to now.

Every time I watch this film... it brings back good memories of my early twenties, a timeless piece indeed.

Also, the soundtrack is an infectious collection of melodic tracks that match the films most theme in many ways. Its just as good in my opinion.

theBeach,Dork Beach,2/10,drystyx,20/1/2007,"""Dork Beach"" wold have been the perfect title for this movie. A dork, by definition is a polar opposite of a nerd, someone so afraid of being uncool that every decision is based upon what other people think, which of course makes them the most uncool of characters. This movie centers on characters that would fit right in with Barney Fife and Ted Baxter. A young guy, who we learn later is the dork of dorks, has a map to a supposed Paradise on an Asian island, and he goes there with a Frenchman and the Frenchman's girlfriend. The Frenchmand, by the way is one of the only two characters with an IQ over 10. The other one is an unsavory sort who warns the dorks (an unheeded warning) that just because the super dork killed a five foot shark, don't take his goofy babble, about being one with nature and commanding all sharkdom, seriously. The three young people take a high dive into water they don't know the depth of. In real life a best case scenario would be instant death, but more likely hitting a rock, being paralyzed, and dying in anguish. This reason alone would make this movie unwatchable. Before that, they go bananas over a marijuana field in such a way that you see many people do, the kind of people who worship Cheeck and Chong, the kind you never really believe are that excited, but merely hide their true emotions with goofy babble. Then they find the field is guarded by gun toting locals. After the dive they come across some of the ugliest people you ever saw. Just physically repulsive. Island life does not show well on most Caucasians. The ugliest woman in the world is the leader. She's almost as mean as she is ugly. She has no leadership qualities, no charisma, nothing. Yet people attack on her command. The trio isn't there twenty seconds before the rut gut ugly woman tells them they can't leave. Of course, that is kidnapping, and an older guy would immediately slit her throat and the throats of everyone else who kept him from leaving, because this place is clearly some kind of Hell, and there is no saving grace to it. None! No appeal at all, unless you were to run off the dorks. Its hard to imagine even kids accepting this, but maybe that's the way the filthy rich spoiled types think. And these are all filthy rich spoiled types, richer than anyone you probably ever met. (They had the money to gallivant across the globe nonchalantly.) One of the trio thinks he is forced to make love to Miss Super Ugly, and you'd feel sorry for him if it wasn't for the fact that her blackmail didn't make sense. Add to this the fact that the marijuana growers know this group of pompous pot smokers is there smoking up their profits, and are undoubtedly thinking of a way to control the business for themselves, and you have a laughable scenario. They might let some vagabonds stay there, or some poor locals, or some retired people, or anyone who has no interest in the marijuana. But to believe they'd let the people most likely to snitch, crowd them out, and take over their business, is impossible to believe under any circumstances. These dorks would have been eliminated from the game of life two seconds after they were discovered. The only saving grace is that the movie does show that the kids are dorks, and the place is a Hell. Still, the plot lacks any semblance of credibility, even in the world of Fantasy.",neg

it's annoying for me to say that as a hardcore Boyle fan. but he can not have been serious when he made this. Alex garland's 'the beach' is one of my most favourite books in the world. it's completely different to the film. this ridiculous film turns an original, psychological thriller into some cheap romantic action packed joke. it misses out two of the main characters, it definitely missed the point with daffy duck (the storyline which makes the book as good as it is), it makes up the Francoise and Richard thing completely.

Ewan McGregor or cillian Murphy should have been Richard, who, by the way, is supposed to be English with black hair and a pale complexion.

theBeach,A Journey at The Heart of Darkness,10/10,taarnaprod,24/1/2009,"The Beach is my all time favorite movie. Ironically, the first time I saw it, I was disappointed. The problem was that the studios were marketing this film like an action movie, which in many ways it can be, but it's so much more than that. This is the reason why this probably should've been an indie film rather than a major studio one. But anyways, here's what I think of the film:

To me this is not far from a Kubrik or Terry Gilliam film in the sense that it's more than just a movie, it's an experience. A journey into the human soul, into the human condition. And sometimes, this is a dark place. And sometimes it hurts. And sometimes you're running around in the jungle aimlessly, imagining yourself right in the midst of a video game. This is truly a movie that holds up after the years and gets better and better with each viewing. You start to slowly pick up on all the subtle nuances and begin to understand how complex and sophisticated this movie actually is despite all its flaws. And even when it's flawed, it's flawed in the most seductive of ways. Leo is spectacular. Far from the sweet, iconic, almost surreal Jack Dawson, Richard is a real person. He's dark, he's selfish, he's cocky, at times we hate him, at times we love him, he's tortured, tormented, he's a lonely soul in search of redemption. He's the ultimate antihero. I admire Leo DiCaprio for taking on that sort of role right after the madness that was Titanic (the best movie of all times). The film also heavily references Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, Rambo and Lord of The Flies in a really intelligent way. Like our brains have become so fried from television, films and video games that no matter where we go and what we do, this is who we are: a media hazed generation.

Watch this film and remember to ""just keep your mind open and suck in the experience. And if it hurts, It's probably worth it"", ""there is so much here to inspire us...""",pos

Nothing excited me, but I saw the title of ""The Beach"" and remember hearing some good reviews from friends. I also remember the critics ripping this movie to shreds, so I decided it would be appropriate for me to find out for myself. I was astonished at how great ""the Beach"" is, but I'm definitely not surprised at the discrepancy of opinions from person to person. This movie is not for everyone; it takes a certain type of mindset to get into the movie. For any ambitious person working hard to achieve the ""American dream"" this movie can come off as nonsensical, confusing, unrealistic, and meaningless. But any person with ambition for life, and exotic, unpredictable raw passion and pleasure this movie can serve chills and strike that person close to the roots. This movie is certainly made to enhance the viewers pleasure if under the influence of marijuana, but it is much more than a ""stoner"" movie. ""The Beach"" is an examination of the pull people feel from their more primitive side. As technology is vastly increasing and becoming more complex; people in the ""real world"" have a tendency to become submerged in the drive to succeed. The beach is the ultimate paradise, and one critique of the movie is that ultimately the paradise doesn't work in the end, I only wish somehow it could. This movie isn't perfect by any stretch, but overall as a movie I give it a B- grade. However, there are a few scenes in this movie that are as powerful as I've ever seen in cinema. The scene when the three newbies first see the beach, for example, is a very awesome sight. Another obvious strong scene is the night swimming sex scene. This scene was not only aesthetically incredible, but absolutely ripe with passion; so much that the viewer can almost feel ""the haze of infatuation.""

Overall the acting is both good and bad. Leo does a great job, which is to be expected from him, but some of the other actors fall short in a few scenes. A few parts of the movie are also rather corny, when Richard pretends to be in a video game, for example. The soundtrack literally could not be better, it's incredible.",pos
theBeach,Wtf?!,2/10,andrewpotter1-1,12/6/2008,"For a movie directed by Danny Boyle (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, Trainspotting,etc.) that stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tilda Swinton... this was pretty bad. It starts off pretty good with a shady guy coming up to Leo's character (Richard) and saying that he knows of a ""perfect paradise"". This crazy guy (Bugs) gives Richard a map that leads him to this perfect place Bugs then proceeds to kill himself. Of course, Richard goes to the beach (along with his romantic interest and her French boyfriend).

I mean, we've seen this storyline before... what do you think will happen? Tilda Swinton gives a decent performance as the island leader, Sal, but besides that there isn't really anything special about this movie. It's not that bad up until this certain sequence involving a video game world... then it turns to complete crap! The musical ""score"" is bland, and when it tries to be original it does not go very well with the film being presented. The ending is sudden and completely breaks off from the entire movie... we've been watching this movie this whole time knowing one thing for certain... and then they take that certain thing away... what are we left with? Yes, I realize taking security away is a way of portraying chaos but it does not work for this movie. Honestly, this probably could have been great. All it needed was a decent editor. Don't see this movie...",neg
theBeach,Didn't Know What to Expect; It Wasn't This... And That's Okay,6/10,gavin6942,16/7/2006,"For some reason I thought ""The Beach"" was about nuclear disasters or something... not sure why. In reality, the film is about an island where a group of people live away from the world (to an extent, though they hypocritically rely on civilization for supplies)... for some unknown reason undiscovered by mainlanders or airplanes, though they are only a few miles from other people.

While the film had some flaws, overall it was really good, I guess. Leonardo DiCaprio is a decent actor, under-rated by many people, I think. His ""survival mode"" where he learns to become one with nature was really cool and reminded me of ""First Blood"", only with a better-looking actor.

The infamous video game sequence was not exactly what I expected, and was actually far more cheesy than I assumed. But funny, really funny. Whoever had the idea to put this in the film really had a stroke of genius that day.

The makeup and special effects department deserved an Oscar for their work. I have seen plenty of horror films and love ""Jaws""... but the shark attack wounds in this film were so believable I could hardly breathe. Amazing work.

All the scenes with Daffy were great. Somewhat gritty and very morbid, I was sucked into this film after the first gruesome scene with him. Excellent visuals. And when we return to this scene a few more times later, it is absolutely excellent. Unlike ""Catch-22"", these returns to the same scene really drive the point home of Leo's state of mind.

The beach scenes were also excellent as far as getting across the point of this being a place that was pure, clean and untouched by man. White sands, clear water... don't know if this was special effects or just a great location, but well played.

My only two complaints are concerning the sex scene and the over-acting. I was rather confused by the scene between Richard and Sal... if he has a girlfriend, why is he sleeping with the nastiest woman on the island? I just don't get it. That was a poor idea and I found it hard to believe Richard was that stupid... but maybe he was.

Also, the over-acting was atrocious. When they first encounter the beach, everyone gets super-pumped. Um, okay... it's a beach. Yeah, it's a really nice beach, but they've been living on islands covered in beaches. It's not a miracle. And when Richard tells of his shark adventure. everyone thinks it's the greatest thing since rye bread and he even tells it in an epic manner. Yeah, alright, it was pretty exciting, but not that exciting. These people need to lay off the crack pipe.

But I liked the movie, and if you like Leo you should like this movie. It's a metaphor for teenagers, I think... how they believe they're independent, but really they're not and in reality they're helpless and stupid.",pos
theBeach,Read the book!,2/10,olof.dellien-2,16/11/2001,"After having read the great book, I wanted to watch the film despite a lot of the bad word of mouth it had gotten. Still, I was disappointed. First of all, a worse casting than diCaprio as Richard can not be possible. I have nothing against diCaprio, but his prettyface is as misplaced as a black actor would have been starring Schindler's List. It doesn't work at all, especially since he still looks as he just came from a stylist after 2 months on the beach where even soap is a luxury item. But even in the beginning he doesn't come off as a seasoned backpacker at all - rather more like one of the tourist scum he claims to despise. Further, the change of personality that Richard goes through during the time on the beach do not come to life. How the director visualizes Richards madness in the end borders on parody. And the spots where the scripts deviates from the book tears apart the logic - basically a lot of details plus some romance and sex that seems to have been inserted because such a film needs romance and sex, but instead rids the plot of logic and coherence. And finally, turning Richard into an American is not a great idea either. Read the book - it is great. Or go travel. Or both. But don't rent the film, it is awful.",neg
theBeach,Phi Phi Leha,8/10,rudimir-bombardinovic,26/4/2008,"First thing to write at the start: don't be influenced by critics bad review on this one. Danny Boyle is one of my favorite directors and it's true that The Beach is different that anything he's done before, many would say too commercial. The idea was to put together Boyle's talent with Hollywood budget and keep best from both.

Perhaps Boyle did loose a bit of his harsh style, but not so much you couldn't recognize it's Boyle - especially in the Duffy's monologues and wacky part where Richard is loosing himself. Actors gave good performances, Richard's ( Leonardo Di Caprio) cocky style and Francoise's elegance (played by Virginie Ledoyen) work good together for romance part. Screenplay is good, supporting Boyle's way of directing with sometimes raw, ""youth way"" monologues and conversations that fit good.

The biggest lack, in my opinion, is a ""ideal society"" part. In Alex Garland's story, on which is film based, it's one of the main questions and occupations of the writer. Boyle should have gone deeper on this subject, this way I had feeling that the end is a bit incomplete.

And here is the best part - cinematography with heavenly beautiful landscape (I couldn't resist to move my rating from 7/10 to 8/10 just because of it). Yes, for all those who thought (including me, I admit) it was digitally supported - the beach and the island are real - it's Phi Phi Leha island in Thailand. It's probably the best landscape I've ever seen in any film. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by tsunami in 2004., so this is the only way to discover its beauties if you haven't seen this paradise personally.",pos

How can someone make such a disastrous film with so great actors as Leonardo Di Caprio and Guillaume Canet ? There's no story, no message, no atmosphere, no sensible dialogues, no beauty, no logic, no soul, not the least trace of intelligence in this film. Moreover I'm not used to being moved by blood or violence in movies but here it was really unhealthy and made me feel sick and uneasy because they were completely gratuitous. I really watch lots of different films and even when they are not very interesting I never feel like leaving . That time I had to cling to my seat not to run away. Anyway I have at least had the great joy of hearing the most wonderful quote of this new millenium. Just picture yourself as a French boy swimming across the sea with your girlfriend and a new American pal.There's about one mile behind you, and one before. Of course, you suddenly feel like making a good joke. You pretend a shark is attacking the girl. Of course, when he realizes you're just teasing him he's furious.Of course, he yells and tells you that's if that is French humour it's not a wonder French cinema can not be exported (?!!). Can you imagine the scene ? What would you answer if you were that French boy ? No idea ? Here it is : `What about Molière ?'. I couldn't stop laughing and I still would if I wasn't so disappointed. I like Guillaume Canet very much and I promise he's a very good actor. It is so bad he should start his international career in such a bad movie. If you go and see the film be sure you're carrying your sense of humour with you. If not, stay at home and watch TV.",neg
theBeach,A terrible adaptation of a great book.,2/10,dielederhosen,19/7/2010,"Everyone knows that the book is always better than the movie (there are exceptions...Fight Club comes to mind). The Beach is the BEST example of how Hollywood royally screws up a fantastic story.

Alex Garland's late 90s novel so perfectly captured the zeitgeist of 20-somethings looking for some adventure in their lives, but only finding the same kind of drama and social pressures that drove them to globe trot in the first place. The Beach is a very sure-handedly written work, both literate and full of action. I was a 20-something myself when I read it, just before I headed to Southeast Asia for a backpacking adventure of my own. In my circle of friends, everyone seemed to have read the book; my copy is long lost, one friend borrowed mine and never gave it back! Fast forward a few years and here comes Danny Boyle's adaptation. I can't decide if Leo DiCaprio was bad casting, but he's a decent actor anyway. Boyle is a very overrated director, but he manages to adapt some moments from the novel pretty well on screen--the fluorescent algae swim at night, the German who gets bit by a shark.

Slowly but surely, though, it's clear that the SCRIPT ADAPTATION for this film is God awful. Just terrible. And Alex Garland helped out with it, which I can't wrap my head around at all. Just to pick a few examples, Sal's boyfriend Bugs is deleted from the movie, so Leo has an affair with her (!). The tension between Richard and Bugs was a crucial part of the novel. And the book's downright apocalyptic finale is done in shorthand for the movie, and it's melodramatic and absurd; it's like a junior high school play.

The movie starts out fine, but by the end I almost threw my TV out the window. Terrible, terrible adaptation.

If you haven't seen the movie OR read the book, read carefully: do NOT watch the movie, forget it exists. I suppose if you will never read the book, the movie might be OK, but if you read the book first, the movie will disappoint. READ THE BOOK INSTEAD.",neg
theBeach,Subversive poke at the backpacking culture...,8/10,lhhung_himself,17/3/2010,"I don't know how many times I've been on holidays in the most incredible and interesting places and overhear tourists or exchange students who just don't get it. Backpackers who remember Florence for the ice cream or in 3 weeks have discovered and are bored by all the glories of Rome.

I loved irony in the beach enclave believing they are superior for sitting on a beach that no-one knows, for not making it touristy, and for agreeing not to bother the indigenous workers with their partying. This is exactly the culture of so many backpackers to Thailand - find the best remotest coolest place to get stoned and party.

I loved the part where DiCaprio acts out Apocalypse Now, smug in his superiority in actually messing with the working farmers, rather than sitting in a theatre watching the movie, completely uncaring about the consequences to anyone but himself.

But the best part is at the end, when he is back home and is completely unchanged from the people who never experienced what he has, except for a picture of his group partying. He completely misses the ironic intent of the sender that he is failing to appreciate what the universe is telling him just as many American viewers missed the filmmaker's poke at their culture...",pos
theBeach,"Worst movie mistake, make characters we couldn't give a stuff about",3/10,CalDexter,11/9/2009,"I saw this almost a decade ago on the big screen. A decade ago Leonardo Decaprio still had a lot to prove despite finding teen pin up status as the doomed peasant in Titanic and as one of the star crossed lovers in Romeo and Juliet. He proved he was capable of making a film that wasn't really any good at all.

Watching Tilda Swindon rave to Yeke Yeke was downright embarrassing. The scene where Leo's character Richard runs through the jungle in computer game style animation almost destroys the effort to keep taking the film seriously.

Robert Carlyle gets to do an impression of a Glaswegian Junkie/alcoholic screaming his head off in a Thailand hotel corridor, smokes a joint with Leo boy and is seen later in a really stupid dream sequence (in the trailer, that said sequence is sold to the audience as an action segment with Carlyle waving a gun around and shouting at a scared Richard, so its a bit of a cheat)then he is never seen again.

The french actress was pretty and her in the ocean 'sex' scene had all the glamour of a Bounty advert. This film bored me to tears. Avoid.",neg
theBeach,Two-dimensional at best and at worst . . .,3/10,pfgpowell-1,8/7/2009,"First question: what's missing? Because something most certainly is, but it is rather hard to pin down quite what that might be. The mystery is that Danny Boyle knows how to make films and then some, but put aside the actual film itself — the acting, the direction, the locations, the action — and instead simply consider the story he tells and the themes he attempts to deal with and The Beach is, to put it mildly, a bit of a mess. Most of the ingredients are there — most, but not all — but mixed in such a way that, sad to say, the moral of The Beach doesn't add up to a row of beans. So why not? What was missing? I suspect that it made a better novel than it does a film. Novels allows the writer more freedom in many crucial ways (I imagine). Films rather tie you down and you run the risk of being far too literal. Every character in The Beach is, at best two-dimensional, and as far as characterisation and motivation are concerned we end up watching something which is closer to a cartoon than a film. Most of the characters are less than two-dimensional, they are one-dimensional, and that is a shame, because treated more sensitively and intelligently, and if it were perhaps less subject to commercial constraints — i.e. with 'heartthrob' Leonard DiCaprio as your main star, making money at the box office will have been very close to the top of the list of the producers' aspirations — there is a very good, very engaging and very thought-provoking film to be made from the material to hand. But The Beach simply isn't it and that by a long chalk. It needed subtlety and it has no subtlety, the central theme (reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies) needs space and time to develop. It is given none. I have no idea what leeway Danny Boyle had, and if he had a lot, the ultimate failure is his, given that he obviously intended to make several 'deep' points'. The story simply does not develop. Crucial scenes are simply presented and the viewer can take it or leave it. Characters do things, but their actions have no basis in their personality. Why did Daffy, the mad Scotsman played with relish by Robert Carlyle, feel the need to escape an apparent paradise and kill himself? There is not even the hint of an explanation. Sal, the apparent leader of those live in the commune, a strong woman with obvious fascist tendencies, should have been far more fleshed out. Who was she, why does this hippie behave so ruthlessly? And there are the members of the commune themselves, faceless to a man and woman: what happened to them that they can apparently with no scruples whatsoever banish one of their own after he becomes badly injured and starts dying of gagrene and they are unable to deal with the noise he makes. Such behaviour deserves at least to be analysed and explored, but Boyle does nothing of the kind. He simply presents it as fact and that is it. Then there is the apparent descent into madness of Richard: what is going on? It happens very fast, he does extraordinary things and finally even kills one of the commune — a murderous act which is ludicrously presented as a mercy killing — but there is neither rhyme nor reason to any of it. These are fatal flaws for a film with obvious pretensions to being 'deep' and which purports to deal with 'deep' ethical and moral quesitons. There are those, of course, who think that there is memorable significance in the lyrics of pop songs and for them The Beach is a reasonable actioner. At the end of the day it all depends what you want. All I can say is that given it's central theme of the ultimate corruptibility of man (and, most pertinently, woman) I was nowhere near getting what I wanted. Sorry. If a film sets itself up to deliver, it sure as hell must deliver, but The Beach delivers nothing but a potpurri of apparent significance. And that's not good enough.",neg
theBeach,Has it's flaws but I was pleasantly surprised.,8/10,dead47548,10/1/2008,"It's a fascinating film that delves into a whole bounty of themes (though this sometimes comes across as the film not really knowing what it wants to be, to me at least) and features a sensational performance from DiCaprio. I saw Richard as naive and selfish and really sitting on the border between man and boy, and I think this comes across wonderfully in Leo's performance. He has instances of extreme maturity (like saving the French couple from the drug farmers when they first arrive on the island) and then moments of extreme immaturity, like talking about Daffy being incinerated while laughing.

Some of the choices in the style were really tasteless from my perspective (the scene with Richard and Francoise making love in the water and the scene with Richard inside the video game being the two best examples) but these instances were rare. It does drag a little bit in the middle and the relationship between Richard and Sal seemed really soap opera-esquire but once he was forced into isolation it really picked up into my favorite part of the entire film. This extremely unique study of the isolation of someone who's not quite a man driving him insane was exceptional. His ability to adapt to the jungle while also playing immature little games is just another example of this boy/man battle that was constant throughout.

The main story of the film is a bit contrived (I never really bought into the ""hidden island paradise"" thing) and the ending was a bit ridiculous as well. The dialogue was pretty poor sometimes to the point of being cringe-worthy but DiCaprio's exceptional performance really helps to hold together some of the sub-par elements of the film; Tilda Swinton was also pretty great. Overall, I nit-picked at a lot of little things but I found it to be quite good.",pos
theBeach,Beautifil Looking Update of Heart of Darkness/Lord of the Flies,7/10,noralee,12/12/2005,"""The Beach"" is ""Lord of the Flies"" about 20somethings who have seen ""Apocalypse Now"" (it's referred to visually and aurally) but don't seem to have read ""Heart of Darkness"" which inspired it, and which this is basically with a bit of sex and/or desire added (I didn't read the book but the reviews say that wasn't in the Garland book either.)

""Deer Hunter"" is also brought to mind with its view of Asian cities and exotic risks; ""Return to Paradise"" takes the same milieu for a much higher moral purpose.

I did like the irony of using Leo in one of the sex scenes as just a straight business service deal. The camera also loves Leo and Boyle ramps up the story line with visuals almost as dazzling as in his ""Trainspotting,"" particularly with the frequent references and visualizations of video games.

Leo here reminds me of how Jane Fonda would be used in her movies, as the naive American or outsider who gradually learns a lesson in sophistication that the rest of the jaded world already knows. The descent is a bit too swift and not 100% believable.

Tilda Swinton is terrific as the leader, though I guess her stupid lug of a boyfriend is just good in bed. Robert Carlyle is briefly in it but is quite memorable and as usual incomprehensible. That man should just walk around with subtitles.

The cinematography is gorgeous, but I think it would be hard to ruin the scenery.

The soundtrack is lovely and surprisingly too is the electronica.

theBeach,Way behind Trainspotting and Shallow Grave but not that bad,7/10,armo_852,8/10/2003,"Shallow Grave was great, Trainspotting genius, The Beach, uhh mediocre.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS OK, the positives. The Beach has a totally original idea, some convincing performances, a reliable director and absolutely stunning visuals.

So why did I come away unconvinced? With those positives I should be raving about this film as I was of Boyle classics 'Trainspotting' and 'Shallow Grave'. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe it was the absence of Ewan. Or maybe The Baech is just not as good

The stage where Di Caprio (who did, despite what some will have you think, put in a solid performance) goes mad in the woods happens far too rapidly. After being so deliberate and careful with the hour prior to this Boyle is careless here, as it appears Di caprio's character just suddenly snaps over one night alone in the woods. Boyle is better than that, as Christopher Eccleston's descent into madness in 'Shallow Grave' proves.

The film from this point seems to lose what it was aiming towards and is messy and ridculous leading to the final confrontation. The best bits seemed to originate from the fear and vicious attack of the sharks. The consequences for the wounded make for compelling viewing but are not central enough in the narrative and are therefore only brief. Inparticular when they are first swimming over to the 'paradise' island and the prank the couple play on Di Caprio about seeing 'a fin'. It is a superb example of paranoia and was well acted

The first half of this film is far better than the second. For a more accurate and complete demonstration of Boyle's directorial talents view the afore mentioned Ewan McGregor thrillers",pos

The press in my country wasn't too kind about it on it's release and I was mid-way through the book at this time so wasn't able to judge myself. However, yesterday I watched it on DVD and thought that it was a watchable movie but not outstanding. My advice, for what it's worth is, if you have read the book don't put yourself out to see it. If you haven't read the book then you will probably quite enjoy it. PS. I thought the Leo as a computer game scene was awful and unnecessary.

The plot is as gripping as lard, the characters, while excellently portrayed, are all miserable lowlifes. DeCaprio's character particularly is a sniveling uncompassionate backstabber, which was a shame because it's the first time I've actually been impressed with his performance. All in all - Tragic.

theBeach,A metaphor for human society...,10/10,Rejisior,20/2/2008,"This movie is really something...

It is a film metaphor for every possible relation, choice and mistake that a person can have in relation to other people.

A metaphor for what human society really is, for what we think we want, and for what we really need.

It is also symbolic for many utopias and social experiments that humanity has undertaken in the course of its conscious history.

The film shows once more that the road to hell is covered with good intentions and that what we consider paradise may actually turn out to be something very ugly.

And what is paradise? Is it in the social or in the asocial? Is it in civilization or in the jungle? The movie asks all these questions without giving straight answers... well, almost...

In that relation, the very last shot of the movie is sheer storytelling brilliance.

The music, the voice-over, the photo slowly appearing and the overall message... universal... fundamental... almost made me cry and I didn't want the story to end... I really had a moment there...

What more would you want from a movie?..

It's perfect for my taste, but probably not for every taste - 10\10.

I, for one, also believe in paradise... I don't know what it is... I can sense it sometimes... it's close and I believe that everyone carries it inside... sometimes it happens when we're alone, and sometimes - when we're together... but one thing's for sure...

theBeach,"Utterly Unwatchable, Except for Tilda Swinton",2/10,Dan1863Sickles,30/7/2006,"""Now get some sleep. I may want to have sex again in the morning."" That's practically the only interesting line from THE BEACH, an incredibly unconvincing and suspense-less film about a bunch of rich backpackers who stumble onto the ""perfect"" beach in Thailand.

Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to be the boy who goes wild in the jungle -- kind of like casting Hugh Grant to play Rambo. I don't want to say that Leo is a total girly-man -- I mean, I know he dates super models and he used to hang with a tough bunch of skateboarders who called themselves the p**sy posse -- but somehow watching him run up and down the jungle trails waving his big knife I just wanted to giggle. For about ten seconds. Then I got bored. For about two hours.

The one bright spot in all this darkness is shapely, statuesque and thoroughly charismatic Tilda Swinton. She plays Sal, the leader of the secluded beach community, who will do anything to protect her home. There's nothing giggly about her performance. She's utterly right. Tilda makes you buy that this woman is strong, smart, sensible, and utterly in control. That goes for her bedroom scenes with Leo, too. Though her motives for sleeping with him are somewhat cloudy, it's clear that she's the one making the decisions and that he responds almost against his will. There's something quite provocative about the way she takes him to bed, tires him out, and then says, ""now get some sleep. I may want to have sex again in the morning."" It's unsettling and unexpected and very, very sexy.

Now if only that scene could have lasted for two hours!",neg
theBeach,Something happening here,6/10,Lucky-63,5/12/2004,"The Beach seems to be striving to tell us something about an era. Our heroes go to an island in SE Asia where rather heavily armed native farmers are growing a boatload of pot. Once they get past that danger, they encounter something we're led to think is like paradise.

SPOILER WARNING

The farmers turn out to be capable of killing to protect their crop. They rationalize their aggression by pointing out that the profits feed their families. OK that's probably like the drug lords in SE Asia. And the paradise is full of sort-of-hippy types (a generation removed), so maybe the film is alluding to the Vietnam era? DiCaprio does a video-game-like scene where he goes crazy, which features some sort of tongue-in-cheek dialog from bad movies about Vietnam.

Phew. Hard to tell with this director, who seems to relish the disconnected sensations and dreamy mentations of multi-drug tripping.

Another interpretation might be this: America is like the pseudo-paradise, and the rest of the world, particularly the third world, is like the farmers, who agree to let the islanders have a paradise on their island world if they don't invite any more people.

Either the writers were grossly incompetent or they just wanted to point at a whole lot of things without resolving into any one thing. Or maybe the director just needed a vehicle to flash around some flesh and some dreamy scenery.

And then there's this third theory: the director is a Coen brothers wannabe. Yeah, I think that's it. Throw in a couple ideas from a Meatballs summer camp movie. And a scene quite a bit like one in Y Tu Mama Tambien. And a tribute to Jaws.

Like, maybe if we throw enough stuff at the audience, like Donnie Darko did, they'll dig it, they'll walk out dazed and confused.

This would be like a great drive-in movie by Ed Wood ... if there were any drive-ins left.

It just seemed like one of those movies you can forget about within days. Leo DiCaprio has some skill, and his performance in this movie is about on par with his Titanic role. He's not my favorite actor, but I don't judge actors by favoritism. I think I basically watched this movie because at the time, I was interested in finding out more about Virginie Ledoyen, the french actress who stars in this movie alongside DiCaprio and the rest of a relatively no-name cast.

There were some action-like scenes, but nothing to really make a fuss about. Overall, I'd call this an average movie - not a stunner, but not a bomb.

theBeach,A singularly annoying film,1/10,jstuit,17/9/2001,"Contains Spoilers The only thing that kept me watching this film to the end was my fascination with the depths of superficiality and stupidty it dove into. The end of the film caps it off: after killing one person, and playing a role in the deaths of four others, Leonardo DiCaprio's character returns home, where he sits in a posh computer lab and decides that despite all that happened, it was a truly wonderful thing to be a part of a clique.

Now that I've seen this film, I'll make a point never to see a film by Danny Boyle again.",neg
theBeach,Probably one of my HBO diamonds in the rough films,10/10,thebricks,11/8/2017,"I did not have high hopes for this film. Coming off of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio was typecast as a teen heartthrob and everything about this film's marketing screamed that. I must have been watching something on HBO like a TV show and decided to watch this just to see how long I could put up with it. The first thing you realize, around the scene with Daffy, is that this definitely wasn't a teen movie. It's a very deep, complex film with a great story, a coming of age film that's...very realistic. I think after some years in college, I started to understand exactly the type of people who were on the island, because I went to college with a lot of people like that. The movie basically is a gigantic criticism of the sort of affluent trustafarians who backpack and go around the world frolicking and partying. The trustafarians are living in a bubble away from the natives, who are struggling to support their families. One scene in particular points out who the real bad guys in the movie were, and it's probably one of the most depressing in the history of film.

It's hard for me to get people to take me seriously to watch this film. Many saw the marketing for the film when it was released, the movie posters and won't give it a chance. It probably is one of my Top Ten movies, simply because of the many messages of the film. Many of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's early works are exceptional like this movie. Highly recommended.",pos

After landing, the adventure-seeking Mr. DiCaprio drinks snake blood, as a chaser. Then, ""Daffy"" acquaintance Robert Carlyle meets an unexpected, bloody demise, leaving DiCaprio a map, which is supposed to lead him to a secret island paradise. DiCaprio invites a sexually active young French couple, Virginie Ledoyen (Françoise) and Guillaume Canet (Etienne), to accompany him.

theBeach,"Great scenery, shame about the script",2/10,billm-4,16/2/2000,"""The Beach"" is blessed with magnificent scenery and outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Darius Kronji. The cast are all up to the job, including many who are unknown to North American audiences. It is a shame that their talents are wasted on a script which is riddled with so many glaring loopholes:

1) The idyllic beach community, which the Leonardo daCaprio character and his two French friends discover, has apparently been in existence on this isolated island for 6 years. So how do they obtain their money for the periodic shopping trips to the Thai mainland for the little luxuries such as deoderants, batteries and Tampaxes which they cannot grow in Paradise?

2) The government of Paradise is always a problem. The Tilda Swinton character has apparently been accepted as the leader, but whether this was arranged by group consensus or sheer force of personality is never explained. It is never made clear how the various tiresome chores (housebuilding, gardening, fishing) are allocated and work enforced. As there are no unifying ideals in the community apart from the aimless pursuit of pleasure, it is hard to see how it could hold together for long.

3) There is a major problem when one of the fishermen who help support the community is badly injured. He is left to die in horrible agony in the jungle - out of sight, out of mind. The loathsome Swinton character fears that, if he was allowed to go to a mainland hospital, the ""secret"" of the island might leak out. The aimless community beach life carries on regardless. Most of the community raises no serious objection to this act of near-murder. Has no one else fallen sick or been injured in 6 years? Does no one consider what will happen to them if they fall sick?

4) The Tilda Swinton character is one of the dumbest, as well as one of the vilest, group leaders ever portrayed on film. She sleeps with the Leonardo character when they go to the Thai mainland for supplies - despite the fact that both have partners back on the island. She seemingly knows nothing about group dynamics and cares nothing about creating divisive jealousy in such a small and isolated community.

5) Although the group has apparently existed for 6 years, with cheerfully casual indulgence in sex all round, there are no children in the community. Also, none of the characters seems to have any family outside the island - or none they want to keep in touch with. If they care nothing for their biological families, how attached are they going to be to one other?

6) When more unwelcome newcomers discover the island, the leader orders the hapless Leonardo to recover their map and send them away. Does she think they are going to forget the location or fail to tell more outsiders about its existence?

I could go on all night about this crassly adolescent vision of an isolated model community, but no sane adult would want to live there or to pay good money to see this ludicrous movie.",neg
theBeach,The problem? Underlying material weak.,2/10,philip-63,15/2/2000,"Everyone involved in this film clearly tried hard to make a filmable story from this novel. In so doing they changed a great deal, as indeed they had to. But I don't think their efforts were rewarded, mainly because the book wasn't that good to start with. Certainly it didn't 'cry out' to be a movie, the way some novels do. So what we end up with is a forced, rather inconvincing - if well shot - cross between 'Hideous Kinky' and 'Lord of the Flies'. Stronger, clearer material would have served these film-makers better.

theBeach,Just awful!,2/10,Rforey,14/2/2000,"It had no plot to speak of, a relatively uninteresting storyline and only fairly good acting.

It was OK until around half way through where the main character had a breakdown and the whole film took on a very ""Thin Red Line"" slant, i.e. pretentious and utterly boring.

It was unstructured and unentertaining; good only for it's scenery and occasional attempts at humour.

theBeach,THIS UNDERPANTS MOVIE BLOWS!,2/10,DoctorSkyTower,18/12/2000,"OH DEAR. I was not impressed with this over-long, over-hyped, boring flick.

The (juvenile) plot revolves around a trio of young travelers finding a map and looking for an island paradise. For most of the flick, nothing much happens when they find this island and its limitless supply of dope, sex and endless beach-frolicking fun. We eventually get to the confusing final third of this humdrum flick, and its pathetic ending.

WARNING! SMALL SPOILERS ON THE HORIZON!

Leo spends most of the time half nekid (or completely nekid in some scenes!) He looks like a frightened 12 year old boy, and is severely mis-cast in his role as Richard the main man. He lies, cheats, and steals, causes the murders of tourists who visit the island and is ultimately responsible for the betrayal of the hippy island community.

The supporting cast are little more than extras given a few lines to utter wherever needed. In keeping with the main-stream MTV look of this flick, the entire cast is young and good looking without a single blemish, pimple or (shock horror!) flea or mosquito bite!

The new age hippy community living on a diet of fresh dope and fish also require a regular supply of tampons, make up kits, game boys, and batteries so their idea of living apart from the modern world is complete nonsense. And all this young hot blood living together under one roof, procreating often and not propagating the species is also a point to note!

MY CONCLUSION? Rent Lord of the Flies instead!",neg
theBeach,A movie only for die-hard Leo fans,3/10,domiman,13/3/2000,"The last time most moviegoers saw Leonardo DiCaprio, he was Jack, frozen to death next to a sinking Titanic and a shivering Rose. It took the currents two years to carry him to Thailand and wash him ashore on ""The Beach,"" which supposedly represents heaven or paradise. At the end of this film, two realizations dawn on the audience: Paradise doesn't exist. And the currents didn't do anyone a favor when defrosting DiCaprio and returning him to the screen.

This time, ""Leo"" returns as Richard, an American who cuts all ties to explore the world and find adventure. Thailand seems the perfect place for him, with bustling streets, exotic beaches, and like-minded adventurous people. Initially, the film seems to pose the question of the purpose of traveling: Are we open-minded explorers, or just tourists looking for the familiar? And it comes up with an answer surprisingly critical of the nation that, thanks to McDonald's and Coke, has made it easy to settle for the familiar abroad. The adventurers in this movie come from England, France, or Scandinavia, rather than from America. Unfortunately, this challenge of the usual expectations of traveling already presents the only truly provoking thought.

In Thailand, Richard dives into the life of the street and meets fellow adventurers. One of them, Daffy, worn out by drugs and sun, tells him a story about a mysterious beach on an unpopulated island. Robert Carlyle, as Daffy, is a perfect cast; his role appears hardly different from the villain in the last James Bond movie. Before he commits suicide, he provides Richard with a map of this secret island. After convincing a French couple, Etienne and Francoise, to join him, the three set out on a dangerous journey to the hidden place. Upon their arrival, they find a small community of adventurers fulfilling their own dreams of paradise. A set of rules regulate their everyday life, mainly stressing the importance of the secret of its existence; overpopulation would endanger their small world. Predictably, rules are broken, and the realization that heaven doesn't exist, and paradise can turn into a nightmare, is so trivial that it's hard to believe this provides the only message of ""The Beach.""

The characters' preoccupation with the bright side of life stands out in the film. Beautiful nature (Thailand can expect a rise in tourists next summer), beautiful women (Virginie Ledoyen convinces as Kate Winslet's successor), and drug use make up the main part of the movie. At least the latter doesn't come as a surprise: director Danny Boyle is best known for his film ""Trainspotting."" The director's influence on ""The Beach"" remains, however, almost invisible, because it's ""Leo time"": DiCaprio's handprint is all over the movie. With confidential and superfluous addresses to the viewer, he draws him on his side, makes him a companion. Stealing a girlfriend, cheating, breaking the rules of the community, lying, and ultimately being responsible for the death of about half a dozen people makes for an impressive list of immoral achievements. Yet DiCaprio is cast as hero from beginning to end. The producers seemed to think that, just by being ""Leo,"" he would get away with it.

Maybe the concept works for the huge teen fan base he has attracted since Titanic. A more mature audience, however, has to question the morality presented in ""The Beach,"" and wonder what else DiCaprio will try to get away with . Wherever he will be washed ashore in his next movie - after ""The Beach,"" he won't be able to rely on past credits anymore.",neg

theBeach,"Not a disaster, but low for Boyle",6/10,KnightsofNi11,28/11/2011,"Many people call The Beach Danny Boyle's weakest and most disappointing films. To those people I say, ""Hey... they can't all be perfect."" The Beach stars Leonardo DiCaprio, infamously snatching the role from Boyle favorite Ewan McGregor causing a dramatic fallout between the two, as Richard, a young guy who, while visiting Thailand, gets his hands on a map that leads to a mysterious island rumored to be a paradise. Richard meets two French tourists in his hotel and asks them to set out with him to find this elusive paradise. From here the film branches out into part romance, part adventure, part psychological thriller. It never really catches its footing and it never steers in a clear direction. It's not a disaster but it isn't an excellent film either.

There isn't much about The Beach that is noteworthy or memorable. It isn't terrible in any one department, it's just lacking in all departments. Visually it isn't anything terribly special. This may be because of the high expectations I have from eccentric visual mastermind, Danny Boyle. The Beach lacks his nuanced flare and incredibly unique quality to the style. The music selection for the film is admittedly neat, but the visuals are sub par in comparison.

But where The Beach really lacks is its poor script and uninteresting characters. There's nothing very compelling about this story and the characters don't engage your mind and nothing special really happens. The dialogue is often silly and unnatural and there are too many unrealistic changes of character tone. There are amateur mistakes being made here, such as when a character is fine one second but then gets overly angry just so that something irrational will happen in order to move the story along. The Beach doesn't flow naturally and a lot of what happens feels very forced. The acting is nothing special either. Tilda Swinton's role is really the only one worth mentioning, considering DiCaprio isn't much more than a pretty face in this movie. All of these faulty elements to The Beach certainly could have been much worse, but they don't make this film anything special.

To see a film of this low calibre from an auteur like Danny Boyle is always shocking, but it's simply what happens. They can't all be winners and The Beach is proof of that. But I can only rejoice in the fact that I can so easily forget about this dull little film by watching 28 Days Later..., 127 Hours, or Slumdog Millionaire instead.",neg
theBeach,"Drugs, girls, and paradise can't save this story.",6/10,mmccull5,8/3/2008,"Started great, sloppy middle, ridiculous end. This movie has an identity crisis. It has the constant narrating of Leo just like Fight club did with Pitt. The beginning is a promising story of a confused boy (Leo) just searching for adventure and hoping to find that one perfect utopia in the world. Long story short he finds it and is happy there. But he slowly goes insane and the story culminates in the realization that there is no perfect Utopia and nothing good can last. It is not that this is a bad movie, but half of the time is spent drilling into the viewers mind how great it would be to have sex and smoke pot all the time. The movie could have and should have been shortened about 50 minutes and at a brisker pace would have been great. Instead we are left with a movie that starts out promising, the middle will make you scratch your head, and the ending will make you burn the disc. This movie could have done with a healthy dose of it's own substance for the audience, namely marijuana which is the only way this movie could be considered good.",neg
theBeach,"If you're over 25, not really for you...",8/10,JenMarsh,15/2/2000,"There could be a miracle and someone over the age 25 may like this movie, but it is clearly targeted for those under that age bracket.

I, in fact, did enjoy the movie. I was interested the whole way through. Much to my surprise, the movie contained much more than reviews and previews had let on.

To sum the movie up in a few words is to say that it is about a paradise that can't exist, yet the challenge in finding one and believing in it. And how far can it go until the inevitable happens. There is more to this movie than a half-naked Leonardo and a bunch of teenagers finding a place to smoke weed. It doesn't require much thinking, just sitting back and enjoying the film, which I think rated better than most thought so.

theBeach,THE BEACH....very nice!,8/10,markdale,15/2/2000,"Well, tonight I saw The Beach! A film that, according to like 89% of the guys in the world would never EVER go see it in their lives because of Leonardo DiCaprio and his god like status amongst young females! Despite what both sexes think of him, I enjoy Leo's movies, especially the darker roles. I didn't know what to expect going into this film, hadn't seen Leo on screen for a couple of years since Titanic. But I went into it with an open mind, and by the end of it, my buddy and I were quite impressed. The scenery was breathtaking...(although I can't award much credit to the director of photography on that one, considering any idiot in that region could just pic up a camera and roll...and it would turn out pretty) Don't get me wrong though..the D.O.P did a wonderful job!! The acting was really well done too, and some of you may not like the narrative voice over, but I enjoyed it. It allows the audience to read deeper into the thoughts of the characters, which if used correctly, can really push a plot line. There were quite a few humorous sequences in the film (Video games anyone) that I thought were kinda interesting.

But enough about that!! I enjoyed this film, and if you are one of those guys who hates Leo, then I think you should see it anyway...because it's not fair to spite someone who's image is molded by the media (notice why he is NEVER at celebrity events...because HE hates all that c**p too...well, i'm assuming)",pos
theBeach,Quite entertaining,7/10,Morgan-10,16/2/2000,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. I'd heard that it had been panned by critics but I was entertained. The story was interesting and I thought Leo did a good job acting, as did the rest of the cast for the most part. It was very different from what I expected, I guess I really wasn't expecting anything. Certainly not a nicey. nicey film, quite violent, and the story dragged a little at times but worth a go for sure.

theBeach,The movie may have dope in it but it is more than just about dope heads,8/10,stoor79,15/2/2000,"I have read some reviews about this movie which bashed the movie for being just about dopeheads on island. Frankly, that is just not the case (though it did cause me to wait a few more days before I actually saw it.) The movie is fairly good and deserves a rating a lot higher than the 4.2 it was at. DiCaprio as ""Richard"" was perfect for his role, I mean who could forget the scene in the jungle where his insanity culminated in him freaking out the running girl by staring at her and making a sound like a snake. Another great shot was the video game sequence, occurring as Richard got bored and began running through the jungle was just priceless. Anyways the thing that made the movie for me was Richard's descent into madness and his strange friendship with daffy. Now I must admit there was some cheesiness in the movie, but it seemed all to fit into place and was put there on purpose. I don't think this movie was as good as Trainspotting however it definitely in my books deserves a 8/10, if you don't believe me, then just rent it when it comes out either way its worth the money in my opinion.

theBeach,Good but some lost potential,8/10,bladerunnerdek,14/2/2000,"Because Leonardo Di Caprio is such a huge star and cult figure, some people have begun to dismiss his work and underrate his abilities. Naturally films like "" Iron Mask "" don't help, but there is definately something in him that gives him the classic "" watchable "" attributes made famous by legends such as Jimmy Stewart and Clint Eastwood. No I am not comparing Leo to them , it's just an example. This movie by Danny Boyle (if you haven't seen his best effort Shallow Grave you should) is curiously uneasy from the start as we see Di Caprio arriving in Thailand alone and looking for adventure. The plot keeps moving along well enough, although it does take a little too long to get to the island. Also, nitpicking here, the island seems to me to be a little too convenient to get to.....I mean it's visible by binoculars from a tourist beach ( come on ! ) Once there the characters that have lived on the island, peaceably we learn with some ruthless drug-farmers, for six years , simply welcome the three newcomers with open arms. Another slightly annoying trait among the ""dwellers"" is they all seem

to be refugees from the eighties, smurky, mid thirty types fed up with the corporate world and universally yearning for nature. Aside from this though, Leonardo and the gorgeous Virginie Ledoyen hold our interest. The sense of comradeship only begins to deal with it's dark side, which would have really made the sense of danger and mystery more alluring, but we do see our hero descend into a self-imposed nightmare when he is strangely exiled by the leader of the group. In the end he comes to terms with what's going on when more strangers arrive and meet their fate at the hands of the farmers..... but the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfying . Director Boyle could have made the finale much more gripping and tense but instead lets us down easily, diminishing the initial menace the concept of the Beach wants to emit. Overall though, I would recommend this movie. If you wonder at Di Caprio and what all the fuss is about ........see him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape . Js",pos
theBeach,Give this film a chance,8/10,karma98,14/2/2000,"This is probably a case where reading the book first is a distinct advantage in understanding some of what has been harshly described as ""incomprehensible"" events. This story is a parable, on many levels, and as such, is ripe with thought provoking, not to mention conversation provoking, material. Isn't this one of the pleasures of seeing a film - the discussion it can foster? I think many factors have influenced the critics: The desire for iconoclasm where Leo is concerned (many reviews editorialize with subjective comments about him); the disappointment that the film is ""dark"" and not noble enough; and the fact that screenwriters have to make difficult choices; e.g., if the Vietnam/video game fascination had been more of a thread running throughout the film, as in the book, then perhaps some of Richard's behaviors would not have been perceived as ""incomprehensible"". In short, I think many things in this film were misunderstood. I enjoyed this film on many levels, but maybe more so because I had read the book. My husband thought it was ""great"". I enjoyed the prerequisite ""Danny Boyle"" inventions which added an element of quirkiness. (I also resent the sense that we have to practically apologize for liking this film!) Richard's character is complex - needy, selfish, sensitive, sometimes cold...this translates as interesting and Leo portrayed him artfully. Also, in a stroke of genius, the character of Sal was made even more interesting than in the book.",pos
theBeach,Fantastic,8/10,abslootvlu,13/2/2000,"This was a great movie. To me it sort of resembled Lord of the Flies. I think this is Leonardo's best role since Romeo. It looks like it was more of ""him"" actually acting in the film. He plays a very stubborn, ignorant, and gutsy guy named Richard who searches for paradise on earth. Soon he realizes that no matter how perfect a situation is, human error will always corrupt it. Danny Boyle's intense camera sequences really help to project the appropriate feeling for certain parts in the movie. I loved it. It really made me realize how crazy our lifestyle is.

theBeach,Disappointing screenplay,6/10,izad_syah,3/2/2000,"Quite a good story but I must say that I am quite disappointed. That's mainly because I have read the book and there were many changes made in the screenplay.

I simply could NOT believe they left out Jed's character (a central character from the book) from the movie. Only the first hour of the movie follow closely to the book, everything strayed away after the first hour. Right up to the end.

But as John Hodge (the screenwriter) had mentioned, ""Novels are subtle, screenplays blunt"". As in most adaptations, characters had to be combined and many MAJOR changes were made (I wished the Richard-Francoise-Etienne triangle didn't turn out like what they did in the movie).

All in all, it is a good movie.. but I would strongly suggest to those who have not read the book go see the movie first, then read it.. or else you just might be a WEE BIT disappointed like yours truly.",neg
theBeach,A Hidden Thought Provoking Movie,8/10,runfeb1971,29/5/2013,"The Beach is a movie I saw and has grown on me. There are many aspects of the movie that seem to be an analogy to our real life. And many aspects that make you think about how we view things. I also see it as chasing Moby Dick, in this case paradise.

Short summary: A young man finds an island that is ""paradise"", which is a community living on a hidden beach. No rules, just fun.

The problem with paradise is kind of like asking someone if they would like to be happy all of the time. It is a paradox. Yes, you want to be happy all the time, but you can't because you would not know happiness if you were happy all of the time.

Do you want to live in a paradise? Yes, but it is a paradox. You can't have a paradise just like you can't be happy all of the time.

Richard finds this island through someone he met named Daffy. Daffy commits suicide after kind of going crazy from realizing the paradox of paradise.

Eventually Richard realizes this and becomes crazy, and then ""grows up"" and accepts the reality of things.

I found many thought provoking issues in this. The one that really stayed with me is the when the two members get attacked by the shark. One dies and the other lives but moans and groans in the community until they drag them outside the community and leave him to die. Richard narrates that ""as soon as he was out of sight and out of mind, the problem was solved"". I think about this with disabled people, mentally insane people, and especially the elders. If they are out of sight then we have no problems. Put the old folks in a home and be done with it.

Another issue I find interesting is the classic case of paradise is when you have no rules and you live however you want. But Richard finds this to not really be paradise after all. Kind of like a teenager that rebels and then finds out later in life that they were really correct on things. Not so simple.

In the end, I think Richard grows up and realizes paradise is not really paradise. He also finds his true self and accepts it.

Overall, an interesting and entertaining movie. Not award winning but worth the view. Enjoy!",pos
theBeach,Handsome and shallow,5/10,dierregi,8/10/2012,"""The Beach"" is a Di Caprio vehicle gone south. This is even more obvious 12 years after its original release. Di Caprio, then a baby-faced, attractive star, fresh from the success of Titanic, plays Richard a handsome backpacker in a postcard-pretty Thailand (minus the shabby hotel) populated by many other attractive youngsters.

Given the premises, this could have easily turned into an over-bloated ad for fizzy drinks, but luckily some darkness is infused into the story,via several bizarre plot twists. The first one involves Robert Carlyle, who worked already with Boyle in the glorious Trainspotting.

Carlyle's cameo is dark and disturbing. It takes place right at the beginning and it is a sign that all will not be well. The middle part is light-hearted. Richard gets acquainted with a couple of stunning-looking French models (I mean, tourists) and they travel searching for paradise on earth.

What they find is a sort of hippie community, living on a hidden beach, next door to a marijuana plantation guarded by armed thugs. Not my idea of paradise, but stillIf we forgot about the ominous signs, now it is time to get our memory refreshed.

The hippie colony is run by a weird Tilda Swinton (not a big stretch for her playing weirdo) and her iron fist will bring nothing but misfortune to everybody. Anyway, the hippies are not painted as altruistic and kind. They are more selfish, lazy people running away from responsibilities and their demise is welcomed with a feeling of retribution. The end feels abrupt and much over the top, compared with the relative mildness of the rest of the movie.

Overall, Di Caprio already showed strong acting skills, but the whole – thin – plot revolves too much around him and eventually collapses in its shallowness",neg
theBeach,Marooned.,5/10,TOMASBBloodhound,10/3/2012,"Director Danny Boyle has since admitted this wasn't a very good film. It takes strong character to own up to one's mistakes, so for this he must be applauded. Anfortunately, myself and many other people had the misfortune to see it before we knew even the director didn't believe in it. The beach was marketed as some sort of conventional thriller/drama which would be the next showcase for heart-throb Leonardo Dicaprio following his huge success with Titanic. Had its makers gone ahead and made a conventional thriller, it might have at least been a box office success. But the finished product is a confused, fantasy-ridden film that tries to be much more introspective than it needs to be. That it is narrated by a character that is neither interesting nor believable only adds to the problem.

Leo plays an American tourist who finds himself alone and bored in a grimy Thailand hotel. A nutty guy from the room next door gives him a map to an island supposedly home to a new-age community with an endless supply of pot at their disposal. Leo is immediately intrigued by this map. Especially once this nut-job commits suicide. He and a young French couple follow the map and end up swimming out to this island and joining the community which really does exist. Personally, I would have turned around and swam back to the mainland after meeting the insufferable Euro-types that make up this community. They are led by Tilda Swinton who plays the same character she always does. An icy, witchy woman. At least she almost looks attractive in this film for a change. She has a strong-armed boyfriend who is a complete jerk. The rest of the island is patrolled by armed marijuana farmers who allow the community to exist as long is it doesn't allow too many new members or gives away their secret. Leo ends up sleeping with the young French woman. Her boyfriend doesn't seem too broken up about it. Not much of interest really happens after that. A couple guys who look like ABBA rejects are attacked by a shark. Probably revenge for Leo killing another shark. We've all seen the Jaws films, and apparently sharks DO take things personally.

Ughh. Since the film is so unfocused, its hard to write anything other than a rambling review. By the last 45 minutes, director Boyle has grown pretty desperate. He throws in animated sequences, fantasy killing sprees, you name it. Nothing any of the characters does by this point makes any sense. Sure, the film looks great, but how could it not with these locations to shoot in? Decaprio has never really impressed as an actor, and he certainly didn't have what it took back then to make us believe in his character. Maybe it helps to smoke pot, and then any true meaning in this film would become clear. Or at least its lack of focus wouldn't matter so much. 5 of 10 stars.

theBeach,"Pretty powerful and enticing with wonderful, likable performances",9/10,Dragoneyed363,4/7/2009,"WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.

The Beach was one of those movies I had been wanting to see ever since I had heard about it really, which wasn't that long ago. I am into the whole ""tropical paradise"" theme of movies, like The Blue Lagoon, because I love their cinematography and they usually are great entertainment with an excellent plot, in some way, and this looked very interesting and entertaining. I finally had the chance to view it and I'm so glad I did.

The best things about this movie are the performances and it's keen sense of paranoia and chaos. I never lost interest because it was so entertaining with it's superb use of intensity! Like I said, the performances, Leonardo DiCaprio's in particular of course, are excellent and all the actors and actresses make their characters memorable and not bland or faceless, in my opinion. Another thing was it's sense of paranoia. I loved how you see how their perfect paradise isn't as perfect as it was made out to be and everything slowly starts to crumble. There were some really intense scenes which heighten your interest in the movie even more, one of the final scenes for example, where Sal is given the choice to shoot Richard and remain on the island or not kill him and leave, and another of the scenes close to the end where Richard witnesses the people who he made a copy of the map to their island for in the beginning get murdered. The movie is very enticing overall, and even though it gets a little mediocre at times, The Beach is very nicely done.

Well, I enjoyed it a lot, and found it to be a greatly put together film with great performances, memorable scenes and characters and since I said I am a sucker for the whole ""tropical"" type theme of films, that might be why I enjoyed this more than a lot of others and find the rating a bit unfair, but still, if you enjoyed this like I did, I'm sure you agree with me that it's memorable and definitely worth the watch for the powerful and true film that it is...",pos
theBeach,When good books go bad,3/10,dirtychild,27/2/2007,"The Beach is a prime example of when a good book turned into a movie goes bad...

The Beach tells the story of an American traveller in Bangkok - looking for the ultimate experience. He befriends a Scottish traveller who, after suiciding, gives the American a map to a secret beach - the most beautiful beach in the world (or so the story goes)...

The Beach feels like a bit of a train-wreck of a movie. Leonard De Caprio - although a talented actor - feels so uncomfortable as the lead.

Danny Boyle (most famous for the film Trainspotting) gives a bit of visual flair to this movie (as well as a pretty good soundtrack) - but with no soul.

The action feels forced and un-thrilling. The actors on the whole feel way too hammy.

You don't really get to feel for Richard (the main character) and his transition over to the ""dark side"" probably because Leonard couldn't act his way out of a paper bag in this movie.

And what is with that video game dream sequence - it probably rates as one of the most embarrassing scenes ever committed on film...",neg
theBeach,No plot/Terrible movie,2/10,mjlinlanc3,14/12/2006,I watched this movie last night on AMC. its the first time I had seen since it was in the theaters and now I remember why I haven't seen it in 6 years. thats about 5 hours of my life that i could have been something much more productive like sitting on the toilet or picking my nose. this movie had no plot other than getting high. couple of the chicks were pretty hot but that is really its only redeeming feature. I was cheering the farmers when they were shooting the kids in the field. The farmers were the best characters in the movie alth0ough I would have purchased an M16 over an AK any day of the week. maybe i missed something but this movie was just plain stupid. Would someone please explain to me the appeal it holds for people. I have heard people comment on how great and important of a film. personally i would have hung myself about 5 minutes after i got to the island...,neg
theBeach,Only The Beach of This Isle Is Wonderful,5/10,Luigi Di Pilla,1/1/2006,"I find the film harmless because it tries hard to follow the adventure or thriller genre. The movie begins promisingly but then there are some ridiculous scenes. It could have been more done because I missed some real action moments or more suspense elements. Sometimes I thought they wanted to carry me on this isle to spend my precious time that was unfortunately wasted at the end. The scenery is no doubt wonderful; just imagine to be there and to relax on this fine white sand. Thank you for this nice panoramic view but next time please combine all with a clever story and don't think only for teenagers. Leonardo Di Caprio was sacrified unnecessary for this role but he deserves better scripts. See instead TITANIC. For these reasons I vote a 5/10.

theBeach,Painful to watch. Skip it and READ THE BOOK.,3/10,saccopoulos,13/7/2005,"I just read Alex Garland's highly readable and entertaining novel, and immediately went out and rented the film version. I don't know what I was expecting, but this was quite possibly the worst film adaptation I've ever seen. I became concerned after 15 minutes, pretty much gave up hope at 40 minutes, and stopped watching 2/3 of the way through in sheer disgust. They missed so many opportunities to make this a good film that I found myself clenching my teeth and my fists every time they f*cked it up. Which they did with astonishing frequency. The best parts of the novel, the most beautifully imagined, surreal, powerful, essential scenes are *nonexistent* in the film version, and the rest is needlessly changed around and incompetently adapted. Things that would have made sense in the book make no sense in the movie, because the scriptwriter apparently thought ""This would be cool!"" and changed around things that are essential for understanding later developments. Other times, they try to show extreme emotions and character flaws way too early in the film without any background to explain why these feelings or conditions exist in the characters. Instead of showing how the characters change over the course of their experiences, the filmmakers apparently thought they could save some time and effort by making them that way in the first place! There is none of the wonderfully subtle character development and gradual revelations that exist in the book. The result is a confused and totally mismanaged mess. I don't agree with the general maxim that voice-over always covers for bad writing, but that is completely obviously true in this particular film.

I really hope this gets remade in the future, by people who have some clue about what they're doing. The two partially redeeming qualities of the film are some moments of genuine humor and a few beautifully shot scenes. The rest is garbage. Completely inappropriate soundtrack, mangled script, an astonishingly bad performance by Leonardo DiCaprio... Save yourself 2 hours of torture and read the book instead.",neg
theBeach,Hmmm...,5/10,schweigermic-1,28/5/2005,"I am not sure if I feel the film is totally nonsense or just mediocre.

The storyline is definitely crap:

A guy who fills a backpackers room with his blood, crap.

A small ganja field, which is guarded by heavily armed: how stupid. As if they will fight with the army or police about some weed plants... Absolute nonsense.

And this lots of pseudo wisdom talking. Crap. And the nonsense Club MED village built by the carpenter with the motor saw. Crap.

The movie is really bad.

Some very important characters are missing. What a shame. The whole story is a different one than from the book. I saw it first time in the theater and I was very sad that i wasted my time watching that movie.

Well lets just say, maybe the movie is not soooo bad, it is just not the movie to the book ""the beach"". LOL.. i guess they had another script.

The only good thing I can say about the movie is, that the nature pictures are great.

theBeach,rather read the book,5/10,lille_smule,20/11/2004,"How do they manage to make such a crappy movie out of such a good book?! Sometimes I had the feeling they were just changing the story for the sake of changing it. Many of the changes were completely unnecessary and some even crippled the story. The book made far more sense than the movie does.

And couldn't they find some other main actor? Leonardo DiCaprio is not convincing as Richard whatsoever. You just don't believe him the traveler. He rather seems to be that very nice kid, that's in the wrong movie the whole time. It seems pathetic that he would have set out for an adventure like that and made the choices he made. It just seemed very odd and contradicting to his character (Even though he played a quite similar guy in Titanic and was very believable there) Furthermore, I just wanna hit him every time he opens his mouth. I've never heard anybody constantly saying so much rubbish. Is he blond?

theBeach,help!,2/10,smartgggg,12/4/2003,"Please help me! I've seen ""The Beach"". I wish it never happened. But it did. Unfortunately. I mean, come on, what was this supposed to be?? The voice over was definitely taken from Fight Club, as was the ""Brad Pitt"" style and look, but DiCaprio is no Pitt and no Norton either, and the voice over gets pretty annoying quite soon. Not even to mention the contents. Or the content of the entire movie, for crying out loud. Don't even get me started here, because it's loaded with sheer nonsense and stupidity. Let me just give a couple of highlights:

Why are their faces so 'clean'? Places like that are loaded with mosquitos and all kinds of other insects that turn life into hell. But no, they keep their pretty little faces.

The plot is schematic, forced -- armed marijuana growers, indeed. Movie might appeal to Ecstasy-addled dimwits in search of cliched utopias and endless raves. Score is good, photography beautiful, but the movie is ultimately empty. One cannot care too much about the characters; they are barely defined. The Beach-combers are indistinguishable except for a few quaintly offense national characteristics. The escape from civilization has no urgency, the perils of utopian living have no freshness

theBeach,Disjointed and ill--conceived,1/10,mnelson-3,12/2/2000,"This was a horrible movie of epic proportion. Run, don't walk away from this movie. Not all of the teeny boppers in the world can save this movie. Word of mouth is very powerful and in this case it will destroy the movie. The movie was an embarrassing adaption of a stylish book. They changed some very key points in the book. Richard wasn't supposed to get together with Francoise, because no one ever gets the French girl, but in the movie they fall in love. DiCaprio did what he does best: running around sobbing and looking suicidal. The only thing that could have saved this movie is if they would have spent less time with Richard having his way with Francoise, and more time focusing on divisions in the community, and Richard's gradual loss of reality. So please take my advice, spend your money on a movie like Magnolia...and put DiCaprio out of his misery.

theBeach,"Shallow would be a compliment. In fact, it's mindless.",1/10,dsgoorevitch,19/1/2018,"Well, Hollywood gave us a good self-portrait of what self-involved human-hating parasites they are.

None of the ""romance"" has the slightest feeling or passion. It's all possessiveness or like going to the toilet: a mere bodily function. To call it ""love/adventure"" is to insult both love and adventure.

What adventure? The narrator (the narration done in a voice absent of affect) tells a tale of someone pretty mindless who travels somewhere and finds something a little less interesting than Woodstock or Burning Man.

There is no reason for anything being what it is. No character development because there were, frankly, no real characters.

Even death is portrayed as ""naturally"" justifiable, even murder. But mostly just meaningless.

The last line the narrator says was laughable. It reminds me of the 10th rate bit of BS I saw written on a restaurant wall near my house: ""In the infinite moments it takes to read these words, you will have lived forever."" Like the pseud-koan on the wall, not a single part of that or this movie is true.

Hollow, empty, dishonest. No such people exist, have existed, or ever will exist. Save your time.",neg
theBeach,Pretty awful in almost every way,3/10,grampz,26/2/2008,"I first saw this movie in Cinemas when it came out, and was originally very disappointed in it. However, after having the misfortune to see it again recently, I realise I was overly generous with my initial feelings about it.

The film is awful. The acting is uniformly bad, though the actors aren't helped by a dreadful script. It spends too much time pretending to be cool and admiring how supposedly hip it is, rather than telling an engaging story. The characters are cardboard, and thoroughly dislikable, though that description might be too flattering for Di Caprio's character of Richard.

At the start of the film we here a brief bored sounding voice-over by Di Caprio, where he states, 'My name is Richard. That's all you need to know.' It's possibly the most redundant and laughable use of voice-over I have ever heard. And the movie gradually gets worse from here on in.

Embarrassing 'fantasy' moments, such as when Richard abruptly goes insane, and the film turns into a bizarre computer game for a minute or so, drags the film down to new levels of cringeworthyness.

The ending is also terrible. Di Caprio is sitting in a fancy internet café somewhere, and downloads a picture he has been emailed - it is of all his old 'friends' from the island, in a group smiling at the camera. Di Caprio smiles at this, with a hint of nostalgia, as if to say it was great fun after all, and that perhaps the experience was even worthwhile. This, even though several of the people in the photograph died gruesome deaths, he killed one of them, was shunned by his mates, and had a gun pointed at his head by another (a disgusting character played by Tilda Swinton).

I really can't stop thinking of enough bad things to say about this film, so I'll be generous and stop there.

Danny Boyle, why did you not retire after making this atrocity?",neg
theBeach,It sucked cheese  a movie for film students or DiCaprio groupies,1/10,JamieClay,2/9/2000,"I would only suggest you watch this film if you want to study large budget failures or just think Leonardo DiCaprio poops roses.

The only thing this film has going for it is the photography, at times it's breath taking but beyond that the dialog is bizarre and disjointed and the acting, specially DiCaprio's is substandard. The stylized fantasy `departures' are often laughably bad.

This film was so full of itself, that there wasn't room for the audience, as though we should be in awe of the greatness being presented. Pleeeeease.

Quite frankly, `The Beach' doesn't deserve any more time spent explaining why it should seen when GREAT films like Angela's Ashes sit collecting dust on the rental shelf.

theBeach,A great adaptation of Alex Garland's best seller. A thrill ride to the end!,10/10,peggy88,14/2/2000,"The beach is a luminous voyage into a paradise we all dream about but never find. It is a visual feast for the eyes that is incomparable in its beauty to any other film in recent history.

The beginning grabs you right away. Snake blood is on the menu, and Daffy is lurking behind the mosquito netting, waiting to send Richard on a trip he will never forget.

The whole scene with Daffy was extremely well done. Carlysle was perfection! And Richard's little comedic nuances were hilarious....

The cinematography was also splendid, and the underwater shots took my breath away. The pumping soundtrack was fantastic, so well suited to the story.

Leonardo played Richard just as I imagined he would be like in the book - a cocky know it all, manipulative, funny, charismatic, and then frighteningly mad. The eyes told the story. He gave Richard an edge that in some ways made him sympathetic, I thought.

The analogies of blood and water are interesting in the darker parts of the movie at the end. I found it fascinating to watch Richard in his madness, and then in his desperation after he was shocked back to reality and cleansed by the pure clean waterfall.

The shocking twist at the end was just right. It gave us just what Boyle said it would give us - the tension and suspense excluding the blood and gore.

I loved the followup ending because it was so true to the book. It gave us exactly the scene that we see in the last paragraph of the novel by Garland - he still hears from Keaty, he still thinks of Francoise, but Richard's expression told the story - you could see his ""memory"" of the lessons he learned...the innocence he lost...are still vivid in his mind.

I thought the middle was edited poorly, and had no flow. The love triangle was not developed enough to make it worth while, but the fantastic first and last acts more than made up for it's middle act flaws! I thought the video sequence was a blast - it went along so well with the reasons why Richard's brain was so muddled: brought home the idea that Richard has no experience to draw on but his video game tactics when confronted with problems - it is his only background when making tough decisions about the problems he is now encountering....

The acting was fabulous from the supporting cast to Leonardo's brilliant performance. I loved Patterson Joseph as Keaty, and Guillame was so sweet as Etienne, Virginie has a natural screen presence and beauty that is so refreshing next to so many of those ""fake"" Hollywood actresses we are subjected to now, and Carlysle as usual was perfect in his madness. Tilda Swinton's Sal was everything I had imagined in the book, and I felt the twist in the relationship between she and Rich really did add something to the story that was missing in the book.....it gave Bugs a substantial reason to hate Rich, something the book never did.

Leonardo took us through this journey with amazing ease and honesty. Seeing him meeting challenge after challenge in this role with such accurate and precise brilliance makes me realise again what a gift he is. Paradise really only exists inside of one's soul..a soul at peace. Richard discovered that through his experience on The Beach, and boy, was it a trip!

I give the movie 4 of 5 stars.",pos
theBeach,"First half is tolerable, then DiCaprio jumps the shark",5/10,Crispy_Quartz,2/4/2015,"The Beach (Fox, 2000, UK/USA) is a Danny Boyle drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard, a backpacking college student who gets lost in Thai ""paradise,"" after following the map of a wild-eyed man, Daffy (Robert Carlyle).

The film is nicely framed throughout, emphasizing the natural cycles of activity in Thailand proper and on the island. The dynamism of Thai urban nightlife is captured, the revelry, the stampeding of western tourists clad with backpacks and Birkenstocks. They chase adventure and experience before it's time to settle down into responsible, civilized Euro-American life. Boyle achieves a stylish look for the film mostly with night shots of the tourist hordes and in the shaded, alley-like bazaars in the urban Thai locations.

The initial scenes of the film follow Richard through these bazaars and shacks, before entering the last hostel he crashes at. Even when Richard is surrounded by locals, the environment feels despoiled by the unseen presence of more tourists. You almost get a sense that shots are alternating every so often between large Thai insects, snakes, monkeys, and sharks on one hand and tourists on the other. These first scenes are still a lot of fun, they're fresh. The dynamism of DiCaprio here might've been a boon to the Thai tourism industry.

Tourism's presented as something that overruns the local cultural ecology and is regarded as a type of spoiling and infestation. It destroys the beauty and authenticity of anything actually worth exploring. The allure of the Beach is it's hidden, this fact makes the place legendary, everyone's heard about it but nobody's been there, until Richard meets Daffy. Daffy, whose been to the Beach, gives Richard the map, but tells him to keep it to himself, this turns out to be Daffy's last command.

Richard hits the town, comes back, he can't open his door, and the beautiful Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) comes right on time to show Richard how to use his key. Just when Richard is ready to celebrate his prospects with Francoise, her smooth talking man Etienne (Guillaume Canet) shows up like a cold shower. Eventually, Richard tells them about the Beach and invites them to go with him. Before they take off, Richard makes a copy of the map and gives it to the people who'd invited him in from a storm when he'd lost the key to his cabin.

Richard, Fraincoise and Etienne finally get to the island with the Beach and it isn't easy. Once they make it through the mountains enveloping the island, they're enamored with a vast field of marijuana plants. Then they see it's being patrolled by rough-looking guards rocking bandannas, AK-47s and cute little leashed monkeys. They escape by getting low, snaking through the field and jumping past a waterfall into a lake.

Now they're in paradise and there's a small, diverse colony of people there. Tilda Swinton is Sal, who shines as the no bull***t president of paradise. This is a proverbial ""is it heaven? or is it hell?"" story. Everything starts out pleasant and unravels with time. Unfortunately, the film itself unravels the same way. They ""jump the shark,"" or more accurately knife the shark. The movie haphazardly refers to ""Heart of Darkness,"" and mentions group dynamics in the dialog without really letting them play out on screen, at best we get pair dynamics. Characters inexplicably fall off the map, especially Etienne who seems like a decent stand up guy.

The Beach doesn't seem to have any allure or hidden treasures behind what we see when we're first introduced to it. It's not because it turns out to be a hell instead of a paradise, the hell dimension isn't achieved in this film. When one character's suffering gets to be too much for the group, they put him out. There are scares and close calls, a few characters get hell, but the main characters manage to pack up and leave before total hellish misery shows itself. Without that element of total misery, it's hard to understand why they make their unanimous decision at the end.

The movie tries to convince us that Richard is the one who's descended into madness, when it's really Sal who we need to be watching out for. It's understandable why DiCaprio is the focal point of the film, he's just about in every scene, but allowing Sal some more time would've made more sense given the climax. The climax, by the way, was a major disappointment, Richard vacillates from psychosis to altruism in short order. Anyway if there are lessons, they're in why we can't have nice things... The treasured things in life are lost when we can't share them, and we easily forget about the nice things people did for us.",neg
theBeach,unlikeable characters lack heart,4/10,SnoopyStyle,21/3/2015,"Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to Bangkok looking for something crazy different from his safe life. He meets wild man Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who later commits suicide leaving him a map to a secret beach. He convinces French couple Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) to join him. The island is in a prohibited nature reserve and growing vast amounts of marijuana under guard. They escape the criminals and find their way to the beach already occupied by a society of young people led by Sal (Tilda Swinton).

Leo is a young unlikeable brat. Françoise lacks the charisma despite being very hot. Their chemistry is hampered by the presence of her boyfriend. They don't have much chemistry even without her boyfriend. They do make a hot couple. The film is unfocused. Danny Boyle jazzes up this adventure but it's missing its heart.

theBeach,"I can't believe Leonard Dicaprio took this role! Perhaps it was better on paper, because this is a dreadful movie!!!",4/10,nlytnd_1,8/12/2013,"I never watched this movie until now, because of the negative reviews it received. Recently I came across this movie again and noticed that there were several peeps out there who feel as though this movie is some sort of lost gem, so I decided to watch it, to my utmost regret. I honestly don't know how anyone could have liked this movie. This movie is extremely overrated for it to be a 6.5. Anywho, I have a feeling that Dicaprio put his faith in the director Danny Boyle (who directed trainspotting), when he accepted this role. There's just no way this could have been a good script, because the movie is absolutely dreadful. It has no direction, no point and is very boring, just like the beach they find. To sum up some elements of the film that were lame to the point of insanity. Richard (Dicaprio) comes across a crazy dude who gives him a map. He speaks of this tropical beach paradise, never mind the small society who occupies it or the marijuana fields guarded by dudes with machine guns. It couldn't be too great, it drove this dude crazy. Perhaps he too had to stand guard for a period of time in solitude, which is what will later drive Richard crazy for a selective period of time on the beach. Which leads us to another significant point of nonsense. So Richard gives a copy of the map to some surfer tourist dudes he meets while in Bangkok prior to himself knowing for sure if the place exists (not a problem). So why doesn't Richard just say to the psycho chick; ""witch, I gave them the copy of the map prior to knowing as to whether or not this place existed. How the hell was I supposed to know that their would be a small secret society who wanted it to keep the beach a secret?"" Anyways, for whatever reason the surfer dudes sit on the map for approx several months before they decide to seek out the beach. When they eventually seek out the beach and are at the approx. 1 mile swim away to get their, they are spotted by the nasty cult leader chick, who then makes Richard keep watch until they arrive on the beach. The period of time that Richard has to keep watch is unknown, but leads one to believe that it's several days to weeks. Why would the surfer dudes camp out for days to weeks across from their beach destination? They can't possibly be afraid of the swim they have surfboards for Fk sake. Anywho, there is so much ridiculousness in the movie I realize that it would be extremely lengthy to point it all out. But yes, it fails on every level. It's has no direction/pointless and it's just plain silly. All of which I could overlook if it wasn't also extremely boring. Even the beach paradise seems boring. This movie is so bad that it's almost worth watching, just to laugh at how awful and nonsensical it is. It's not quite Troll 2 or The Room, but it's not far from it.",neg
theBeach,A good and entertaining surprise,7/10,toinou328,2/12/2012,"This film was actually quite good despite its bad ratings. Most people who knew this movie around me told me it wasn't so good and very disappointing, but one of my friends had the DVD and gave it to me so I could watch it and make my own opinion, well I don't regret it.

My friend was the only person to tell me it was good, and I have to agree with her. Of course, as other reviews here on IMDb it's not flawless, but it is an overall entertaining movie. DiCaprio was amazing as always, this guy really talent, and this film is just another great performance for him and a proof that he's one of my favorite actors.

Now, I'm french, and let me tell you I didn't know what to expect from Guillaume Canet and Virginie Ledoyen in a British/American movie with him, and the few ""putain"" and ""merde"" dropped by them some time to time added a very cliché look to the film, but then, at least the story was more interesting than their acting (but they're still good actors/actresses).

As for the story, it is a quite ""old school"" film and that's why I liked it. No real ""OMG twist"" at the end or the middle, no unrealistic characters, and none of that reversed psychology thing that most films use in thrillers nowadays. It seems like it has become the only way to surprise the spectator : to discover that everything from the beginning of the movie was fake and/or the main character was nuts. This one keeps it simple but still f***s with your mind if you see what I mean. At some point you don't know what's real, what's really happening, what you should trust...

All and all it is a pretty good film, I recommend it to anyone looking a nice entertainment with convincing acting from DiCaprio and an decent storyline.",pos

The story is ridiculous---and the actors give limp performances---indicating that they too did not believe in the project. The script is really bad...as banal as its possible to be. Danny Boyles direction is clunky...and he does not get good performances from his actors. Was this aimed at a teenage audience? Perhaps we will never know. Leonardo Di Capprio is totally un-convincing in the leading role. When that happens, the movie is almost certain to fail...and this one does. There is a market for movies that are SO bad..they must be watched. This doesn't quite fit into that category...but its near..!!!

theBeach,Expensively produced cheap entertainment--a fantasy without the treasure,6/10,secondtake,8/12/2010,"The Beach (2000)

You want to like this movie, for sure. It's about a dream come true, if if you've ever travelled even a little in this backpacker Gringo trail kind of way, you'll feel like you're there.

But then, it's also just a movie, and it shows an indulgence now and then, an implausibility not in the big idea (which is absurd--and digitally invented, by the way, the beach part), but in certain interactions. The people are implausible, the situation, the feel good idealism. When it goes bad, it's only in a ridiculous way (the first hint is when our star, Leonardo DiCaprio, defends himself from a shark and he gets blamed for making the shark angry).

The beach itself is a kind of tropical trope (I never thought I'd get the chance to say that--tropical trope, tropical trope). That is, it is only what perfect beaches are--protected sands, aqua waters, no bugs, no snakes, no poor natives trolling for alms. It's a kind of Club Med without the corporation. So naturally it's appealing, but only in a superficial way. And the whole movie echoes this obviousness, this shallowness. Even the big conflicts are kind storybook simplistic, and a bit silly, or overly sad (near the end, with the shootings).

DiCaprio is terrific, really likable. The other famous star is Tilda Swinton who does her best in a role that maybe didn't have room for much depth--she's the ruler queen of sorts. The others I didn't know (a couple are director Danny Boyle regulars, it seems). Oh, did I say Danny Boyle? Yes, this is a film by the guy who did Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting, both throbbing, excessive, and amazing movies in their own ways. And probably equally insensitive (to the poor in India, the anti-drug forces), so it's no surprise that he stepped on the toes of the locals when filming ""The Beach"" by bulldozing the beach and ignoring protests. (The big tsunami reshaped it back to what it was, a small consolation for that disaster.)

So, if you don't mind a lot of niggling issues and downright meaninglessness, and just want to fantasize a bit, you might enjoy a lot of this movie. You might settle for Cape Cod, though, if that's your second choice.",pos
theBeach,This tropical adventure achieves practically nothing,4/10,Samiam3,14/8/2010,"Watching the Beach is like looking at a postcard from a tropical island: it is a pretty picture, but it is also paper thin, and nothing happens in it.

This motion picture left me disappointed. It starts off promisingly, but with each passing chapter (sometimes pair of chapters) the story grows more dull. The editing is clunky, the script is underwritten, the acting is more wooden than the trunk of a palm tree, and the ending is rushed and anti-climactic. The only thing this motion picture really has to sell are a handful of nice shots and a good score.

Judging by the sloppiness of the story telling, it is clear that The Beach is definitely one of those book adapted movies that butchered its source material. It is a story that could've amounted to so much more. There is too much narration and not enough intelligent dialogue, and every now and then, just when you think the film is becoming something good, it changes again. Individual scenes work well on their own, but not in the context of the whole story. Take for instance a love scene between Leo Dicaprio and the french girl he invites on his trip to a lost paradise in the South Pacific. It's a well directed charming little sequence, but unfortunately, that particular character relationship ends with the scene.

Another problem with the Beach is that it requires a strong compelling lead, which it does not have. Perhaps Leo was just too inexperienced as an actor at the time. The character feels like a nobody, and his persona is sold to us almost entirely through his narrative monologues which feature pretty scrappy lines of dialogue.

In the end, the Beach sets out with ambition but the trip is unsatisfying. It is weak and ineffective, and if it does nothing else, at least it will remind you of how far both Leo and director Danny Boyle have come since this.",neg
theBeach,Hollywood offers beach boys and beach girls looking for the meaning of life,6/10,andrabem,14/1/2007,"""The Beach"" has Danny Boyles signature and that is why I trustingly picked up this film at the DVD store to watch it. It was a big disappointment. Danny Boyle directed ""Trainspotting! What happened to him? In ""The Beach"" the characters are portrayed superficially. The story runs like this. Leonardo DiCaprio and two friends with the aid of a map go to an island (located somewhere in Thailand) and there find a beach in which there is community of people who ran away from civilization and are trying to live a new kind of life, without restraint and hypocrisy. The film shows the problems and conflicts of this community and the inner struggle going inside Leonardo DiCaprio(his thoughts and reflections are revealed by a voice in off). But the characters in this film have no depth at all. It is in reality a Hollywood movie. If you compare it with ""L'Auberge Espagnol"" this film really sinks in the sand.

""L'Auberge Espagnol"" and ""The Beach"" have some plot similarities. Both portray young people who try to live in a different way. In ""L'Auberge Espagnol"" the characters have a face and a name and we care about them. Now in ""The Beach"" the characters are cardboard people. The deep changes going inside Leonardo DiCaprio remain almost incomprehensible.

For those that want some adventure film with exotic locations ""The Beach"" is all right. You'll have your fun. But if you're looking for something more avoid ""The Beach"".",neg
theBeach,Unconvincing,3/10,jimbo-93,4/8/2000,"I wanted to like like this film. Having spent some time in Thailand , I was eager to see a film in which Koh Phagnan was portrayed. Wow, was this dissappointing. No character development. Implausibility. Silly changes in tone. This film has more shark attacks than Jaws. In warm water Thailand? The community's compound was reminiscent of a luxury resort, not a slacker hangout. The film's final third simply makes no sense. While I applaud the audacious and Non-Hollywood approach this film takes, it is a bold failure. Pretty locales, though.

theBeach,Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing?,2/10,Fredichi,28/7/2000,"Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing? Who cares as long as sexy Leo is shirtless. That alone probably sold this movie. Sad, but true. The fact that Mathew Perry's younger better looking lost brother takes off his shirt is enough to get a studio to waste millions of dollars.

Yeah sure Leo can act. But not here. Here he is playing himself. A big dull jerk. He should stop partying and get back to sharpening those acting chops.

The movie: It blows. It starts out good. But lots of movies start out good. It's easy to start a movie in the right direction. But this one beaches itself early and sits there flopping like a dying fish for the rest of the movie.

Do we want to be Fight Club? Lord of the Flies? Apocolypse Now? Midnight Express? What do we want to be cause we sure aren't original. The premise is too old to be original so it would of been better to pick an angle and go all the way with it.

If you want to go do the paradise turns to hell thing then do it. Don't stop halfway and decide to throw in a whole bunch of other junk.

Danny Boyle is a good director, I like most all of his other stuff. I even like A Life Less Ordinary. Which leads me to believe most of it can be blamed on Leo. Once Leo is involved you got unneeded clout and pressure. Will it be something the 14 girls can watch? Will they like it? Will they see it over and over? Danny Boyle and Leo seem to be such and odd pair. Leo used to be Danny Boyle material until Titanic (What's Eating gilbert Grape, Basketball Diaries). Then he was big studio property. He's no longer edgy just cocky.

Anyways. I wonder if this would of been better with Ewan Macgregor in the lead. Probably since Ewan is infinitely more likeable. There were some parts I liked. Like him killing the shark. Only because I hate sharks and I would love to be able to kill one if I was attacked. The music is good. The scenery is good but not incredible enough to spawn that type of devotion the characters have towards it.

Major problem was nobody was likeable. Except the French Guy. The only one who was a decent human being. The rest were arrogant obnoxious selfish cruel hipsters hiding from their yuppy fates.

Yet another reminder we are all flawed and bad people.

My response to this annoying trend in films: I watch movies to escape. I don't need to be reminded that people suck. I know they suck. Show me idealized heroes. So me people with character, integrity. So me tragedies. But make the hero have at least one really good quality please. These qualities don't need to be limited to Disney oversimplified portrayals.

This is a terrible review. It's all over the place.

Kinda like the movie.

Skip this movie unless you're a 14 year old girl (who probabaly has already seen it) Rent Lord of the Flies instead. Either version; the old B+W is better though.",neg
theBeach,Beach plays like a fish out of water,3/10,dfranzen70,25/7/2000,"When Leonardo DiCaprio was riding the wave of Titanic's seemingly endless cashflow, he considered carefully which screen roles to pursue next. Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.

So what does the so-called ""King of the World"" choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.

This movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.

It goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie. Which is kind of eerie, since to me he looks about 12 years old. But hey - some people seem to think he's hot stuff. Oh, and despite a lot of swimming and rain, Leo's hair never seems to move much, but maybe I'm just nitpicking.

As for the plot - well, like most of the dung floating on the big screens these days, you should be able to predict it all the way through. Some of the actions of these islanders will leave you scratching your head. If this is what would happen in a paradise setting with so-called 'civilized' people, I'll take savage headhunting tribes any day.

I won't lay all of the blame on poor Leo. The acting is absolutely wretched, and the whole time I'm watching this dreck I'm wondering why these infantile boobs were even STAYING on the island. I know, that's a slap at the screenwriting as much as at the acting. But aside from the magnificent scenery, this is a virtually unwatchable movie.

Your best bet is to simply skip this yawner and check out Survivor itself. At least there the actions and reactions are a little more realistic - although, knowing how well-staged that show is, maybe not all THAT realistic.",neg
theBeach,"Not the worst of 2000, but not far from it",2/10,ryangilmer007,18/5/2000,"""The Beach"" has excellent photography, but provides nothing new it terms of story or acting talent.

While the novel may be of high quality, the film seems like an expensive and take-off version of ""Lord of the Flies"" as there is a society, secret from other adults and nobody else can come in, least they'd be killed.

The idea that people sneek in, that the society is all fun and games (and not killing, hence different/take-off of lord of the flies), that people cannot leave (they are in or out of the society to stay), make this a skulls/lord of the flies hybrid, with almost limitless possibilities.

However, as the location can go nowhere, neither does the story. Apparently, the love interest, the friends who came with the map, and the funny shopping trips are supposed to add to the story. However, they along with Leo's narration and the video game of Leo killing and stomping, and visually looking stupid detract from the beach atmosphere.

They make us look deeper. Deeper is where we find and question--> Leo got $20 for this? The film crew trashed the Beach?

Even without the detriments, The Beach is a beached whale.

Robert Carlyle is interesting, but his character is mysterious and not fully flushed out.

All-in-all, the movie's best (and perhaps only) redeeming quality is that there are worse.

theBeach,(6/10) Pretty pictures - but little substance in this adaptation,6/10,David Fick,21/2/2000,"The Beach, Danny Boyle's new film, is a philosophical exploration of the concept of Paradise. A postmodernist slice of life is served up with splendid cinematography, stunning locations and a cast that tries very hard. But the adaptation of Alex Garland's novel is underdeveloped, not allowing much scope - or script - with which the actors can work.

The basic plot follows Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his quest for finding something different. When a raving lunatic (Robert Carlyle) provides a map to a paradisiacal island, Richard sets off to find the place, with two French tourists (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) in tow. They find the beach, which indeed seems to be a heaven on earth, and are inducted into the multi-national community under the instruction of its matriarch, Sal (Tilda Swinton). The question is: how long can this paradise last before it is lost?

DiCaprio does as much as he can with the rather shallow character of Richard - this actor is developing his skills quite admirably, although none of the anti-DiCaprians would care to admit this. He layers his performance with a nice dash of cynicism - just enough to balance the idealistic world which is presented to the audience. Swinton is impressive as Sal, in a very Apocalypse Now-type character and neatly captures the conflicting values of what it takes to preserve their paradise. Ledoyen has little to do but look alluring and Canet, as her husband, is wasted in what could have been developed into a solid subplot. Carlyle is perfect in his cameo as the man who provides the means for finding the island.

Boyle has set a credible standard with Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, but does not provide a similar film ""experience"" with The Beach. Much of the fault lies with John Hodge's superficial screenplay, which skims over Garland's book and tries to soften the blows which are dealt in that text. Although there are very good sequences within the film, the piece jars as a whole and really drags through the middle of the story.

This could have been a great movie, falling short as a result of the lack in balance between story and pictures. The pictures are nice, but a substantial story is what should be provided as a solid basis for any film - we are after all adult audiences watching a film about grown up issues.",pos

theBeach,Too High a Score?,8/10,michaeltrivedi,2/10/2019,"I thought it would be right to give The Beach an 8. It's dreamlike scenes on islands really got to me. You really felt like you were a traveler. It was also awesome how an eerie secret comes about, regarding a secret island. It adds a lot of intrigue and suspense. The scenarios that take place on the island are also well done, but I think it was the beginning that really is really appealing. Him discovering the island and getting situated.

Well worth the watch. Great vacation flick with cool suspense.

On top, everyone who traveled for quite some time in South-East-Asia will smile here and there because the movie really shows some aspects of travelling as a backpacker there (if you want or have to travel really cheap) and captures the mood well, especially if you dare to go deeper into the more rural and more backward regions and into the pits of the big cities like Bangkok.

Anyway good acting, fine cinematography and a sometimes thrilling story make The Beach an indeed sometimes pleasant trip and sometimes nightmare strikes back.

theBeach,Underdeveloped but Fun,7/10,dansview,8/6/2019,"I have not read the book. So forget that aspect. Maybe the reason for not sharing characters' back stories is a way to say that you can be anyone on a vacation, or everyone starts fresh on a deserted island.

But I personally prefer to hear about the lives of all key characters in a movie like this. Just have them explain in a conversation with each other. Then I would care more about them. But they didn't do this.

I like to reminisce about being young and about adventures I had or wished I had. So I enjoyed living vicariously through our main character. Thailand is one of those places where you are likely to meet Europeans seeking adventure or release, because many live in cold, uptight societies. So I believed the fact that most of the beach people were from Europe.

It is totally true that no matter where you travel, you bring yourself and your nature with you. There are some good lines in this film about that. Also that any grouping of people will include ""Alphas,"" ""Betas,"" and assorted misfits. At every job I've ever had, ever group trip I've ever taken, every school I've ever attended, there were always all those types, and they didn't get along.

Something I read into the plot that we are not told, is that the leader woman may come from money. Maybe they don't just exist on money from selling pot. She probably has a trust fund. That may not be in the book. But it would make sense.

I liked DiCaprio here, because he had that fresh, youthful loser guy vibe down perfectly. A guy who had nothing going for him, but was ready and eager to reinvent himself. He looked genuinely excited to be alive and experience this adventure, until it went bad.

I totally believed the young French couple. They were perfectly cast. As were the beach dwellers. I also liked the device of using physical injury or illness as the threat to paradise.

As for depth, we needed to hear more conversation about the nature of life. There is a good line in the final narration about what it means to find paradise. But I would have liked to hear some debates about morality. At least there was one somewhat Christian guy and one Catholic who shows some integrity.

They should have cut the entire sequence of animation. It did not fit. It was like a separate movie. I like the idea of our character starting to lose it, and witnessing what he did, but minus the technical hijinks.

Meanwhile the ending was fine for me. It made sense, and I loved the touch of having him reflect on it all at a café.",pos
theBeach,The longer I live in Thailand the more I appreciate this great movie!,9/10,OMTR,16/5/2019,"I saw that movie in a theater in Europe 19 years ago. Four months after, I went to have dinner in a Thai restaurant and there I met My Special One. I was happy to discover some places in Thailand before mass tourism destroyed everything. I haven't been back to any southern tourist destinations for more than a decade and I do not intend to return there. I feel the same about Bangkok, and I am happy to be 'lost' in the paddy fields and in the woods by the Mekong River, at the border with Laos. The longer I have traveled, and the longer I have lived here, the more I adequately appreciate this great movie. Many of the characters are like people I have met during my life here and abroad. Do not miss this movie just because of gossips!

I decided recently to start reading nooks that became my favorite movies. The book was just used as a rough outline for the movie. That's not to say the movie is no good-it is.

DiCaprio is as strong as ever (and manages to look younger than he does in Titanic despite it being 3 years after) and the classic Danny Boyle trippyness makes its way through.

theBeach,Doesn't reach the heights it could,5/10,Floated2,6/4/2017,"Having not read or being familiar with the novel of which this film is based upon, I had a clear view and non-bias judgment based upon the film in a viewing. The Beach is somewhat looked upon as a forgettable or lesser known film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and a lesser Danny Boyle film. This is for obvious reasons. The film did poorly in the domestic box office but was able to make up its budget due to the foreign market (perhaps due to DiCaprio's starpower, since the Beach was his first film after Titanic).

The film has an interesting premise and somewhat decent plot, but it doesn't reach the proper levels that it could have. Not knowing how much is adapted based on the novel, it is more difficult in judging. However, the film is quite bland when watching despite its scenery. It felt more so like an early MTV based film than and actual mature Danny Boyle film. Leo plays an interesting character but besides him, we don't seem to care about the rest, and that hurts the film. The final 30 minutes or so fall downhill as it becomes tiresome and tedious in a bad way.",neg
theBeach,Not your average trainspotting,5/10,Semisonic,21/8/2016,"If we get to think about it, Danny Boyle's highest point as of 2000 was definitely the year 1996. Trainspotting was such a smash hit and a defining moment of the whole generation that it was just too tempting to try recreating its success. And, with a new emerging star of Leo DiCaprio, whose pretty face has been looking at us from the posters on the girl room walls ever since his Titanic days, the task seemed like a piece of cake: add some palms, beaches, spice it up with a French hottie and add some Robert Carlyle's brilliance as a cherry on top and a guarantee of the old-school spirit. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Or so they thought...

Some spirit you can't deny this film indeed. Boyle's signature upbeat techno soundtrack, lush imagery and the whole sense of an acid trip do make this film look like its director's older child. And even though DiCaprio of 2000 is more of his annoying adolescent self than of that solid and mature figure he's become later, he is natural enough that you don't have to wish Ewan McGregor was back at his place.

However, this time something's missing, some invisible but crucial glue that holds the story together and makes it evenly paced. Trainspotting was so amazing because it never dragged for a second. The Beach, on the other hand, feels much more jerky, combining the intensity-packed moments with outright droning or unnecessary filler. And while that depressing Scottish scenery could make even a filler look refreshingly novel, beaches of Thailand, although beautiful and calling, are more fulfilling for a tourist brochure than for a movie with a certain pretence of cultural weight.

Still, it's not the patches of horrible dialogue and ridiculous continuity that bring this film down. Apparently Danny Boyle is better at building a story than dismantling it. And since The Beach' plot reaches its paradisaical climax only halfway through the movie, desecrating this paradise and bringing us back to the mortal world was a paramount task. And that's where it all went haywire, with lack of logic, consistency and sometimes even basic sanity. When an organic utopia falls apart it's never pretty, but one doesn't have to turn it into a travesty.

All in all, The Beach is good at being a story of a spoilt kid's dream adventure going slightly sour. As for anything behind that pretty but shallow facade, like strong characters or a gritty story of their struggle for their ideals, don't hold your hopes too high.",neg
theBeach,"good cinematography, but shallow, too short, and disappointing ending",5/10,summerloud,21/1/2012,"i loved alex garland's novel, and so even though many people warned me that the movie is not as good i decided i had to see it.

it starts out fairly good, the opening scenes get you right into it, the actors are well-picked, the music fits well, the scenery is beautiful

unfortunately the longer the movie runs the worse it gets. none of the characters on the island get developed at all, there seems to be no time for that. the movie stays pretty shallow, and navigates around the more nasty parts of the book, especially towards the ending

the ending is such a let-down if you know the book. instead of a gradual descent into madness with a thrilling climax it just kinda ends... thats it. none of the Vietnam war stuff, none of the psychological stuff between the inhabitants of the beach... well, i guess to do that boyle would have needed to develop the characters from the start, which he never did. the only character that has even a little depth is sal,

its not an easy book to turn into a movie i guess, but a little more depth would have gone a long way in improving this. as it is, it comes off as shallow and superficial as your usual travel acquaintances in thailand...",neg
theBeach,Underwritten,6/10,evan-richards,29/3/2010,"Two great performances in this movie, by Leonardo DeCaprio and Robert Carlyle, and it has an interesting plot that could have worked better. In the commentary Boyle explains that he generally avoids back-story, which is undoubtedly a sound approach, especially in thrillers. But the drawback in this movie is that everything ends up in the same dimension. Nothing is in relief, nothing in the plot casts shadow or throws light. This happens and then that happens and for what reason and anticipating what end aren't very important. Basic storytelling starts with character X wanting something. Boyle's first movie, Shallow Grave, is such a fine movie because of how well that principle is put into effect. In that case, the thing wanted, i.e., the money, is basic and self-explanatory as a motivation.

The characters in The Beach are drifters and pleasure-seekers to whom nothing seems like such a big deal. I have no idea how you can build a thriller around that, but one thing I know would have helped would have been to give the actors better-drawn characters to work with. Some pretty terrific actors, including Virginie Ledoyen, Patterson Joseph and above all Tilda Swinton, are wasted in underwritten roles here. They do interesting things from time to time, but they always fade almost immediately until they are brought forward again to serve the plot. The movie feels like a showpiece for DiCaprio (and, briefly, Carlyle), and his acting is remarkable, especially considering that the writing of his character is pretty unfocused too. I recommend this movie for his performance.",pos
theBeach,Deviating from the book,5/10,nigel-denning-2,30/3/2009,"The original book of ""The Beach"" was an original work which when written in the late 90's was set in a slightly fictional world aimed at contrasting the filthy vibrancy of Bangkok with the peace and unspoilt tranquillity of the Islands of Thailand Surat Thani Province. What a shame the latter no longer exists having been overrun by commercialism and high-cost tourism!

Casting is very competent, most notably Carlile as ""Mickey Mouse"" who combines quirky with disturbed in exactly the right proportions. Less able, however is Di Caprio himself - his novice truly shows, and it is fortunate that his performances have improved steadily since the making of this film.

What a shame the film goes all ""Hollywood"" on us in introducing an intimate relationship between Richard (Di Caprio) and Francoise. Although an integral part of the film, nothing of this sort happened in the book, and the original story was a lot richer for it.

However, the book was ruined by arguably the most pitiful ending Garland has ever penned. Indeed, the most implausible and ridiculous ending of any book I think I've ever read. So I was VERY relieved to see that the film introduced a completely new ending, which I bet left the author wishing he'd had the vision to end the book in that way too!",neg
theBeach,Read The Book / Don't Read The Book...,5/10,Rixubishi,13/11/2008,"I first saw The Beach maybe six years ago, and at the time thought it was a good enough film. It still is. However, I agree with most of the people who've posted comments about the movie that have also read the novel by Alex Garland.

After telling my friend about the movie, he said he'd read the novel a couple of years before, and he couldn't stop banging on about the severely altered and missing parts.

Now, let me say, I am quite accepting of movie versions of novels making one or two minor changes to the novel and leaving lesser incidents out, but this film took it to a whole new level.

Lead character Richard's nationality has been swapped from British to American and vice versa for Sal, the commune's leader-of-sorts. There is no inclusion at all in the movie of, for me, one of the novel's defining characters: Jed. Also, in the novel, Richard has no sexual relations with either Francoise or Sal(except for in his head). These are only a couple of the issues I had.

My final gripe is the alteration of the ending. There is no reason to change the finale of the novel. Sure it's depiction is rather graphic but if film classification boards allow films like Goodfellas and Fight Club (which is also based on a novel) to be released, then there is no valid reason at all to dramatically alter a superb ending in favour of a mundane, happy one that we've all seen a million times.

If you particularly love the film, I'd say don't read the book. You'd probably end up with an opinion similar to mine. If you love the book, you'll probably have seen the film, and will have many of the same issues that I do.

The novel is screaming out for a faithful adaptation.",neg
theBeach,Read the book and don't bother with this film!,4/10,murphs23,25/9/2008,"Fortunately for myself I read Alex Garland's novel prior to watching this film and having done so I am grateful that it was not the other way round. The scriptwriters for some reason decided to only loosely base the events of the novel into the film and as a result this comes across as a rushed and poorly directed piece of work.

What immediately springs to mind is the main character Richard, who is portrayed not as the stereotypical English traveller that is intended by Alex Garland but by the fresh faced American Leonardo Di Caprio who it seems never has a hair out of place in the entire course of the film. But what most annoys me about this movie is the complete omission of Jed, a pivotal character in the novel who is for some bizarre reason expelled from the script.

So many aspects of the film lack the novels breathtaking tempo, and the detailed descriptions that can only be put across in a book fail to come through in the screenplay. All in all this film is exactly what Alex Garland was looking to avoid when writing in the sense that it is pure Hollywood, with none of the characters coming through as believable people in the context of the situation they find themselves.",neg
theBeach,Exploring Below,6/10,billion_mucks,17/1/2008,"Often movies are about one character among a problem, and resolving it. Often they make a travel to solve the problem, story develops all surrounding the problem or obstacle.

""The Beach"" has the quality of not being of a story, but more like a quest. It is about a group of youngsters fleeing from a frenzy society to form one of their own, and is good material leading to a profound narration, and Boyle uses his knowledge over the sublimation of messages and subtleties to accomplish it's goal: Society at it's most crude form develops, over a study of spatial behavior and human mentality, leadership and a poignant portrait of the Society's hierarchy and it's components.

This film is not conventional. It's about a form of discovery, when in the beach, a calm beach; we stay in contact with Nature and rediscover our most basic needs and desires. Boyle straps every character into the magnifying glass and delivers an unorthodox masterpiece.",pos
theBeach,Movie V. Book,6/10,percent-shmitty,28/4/2007,"Let's start with the good points of the movie: -Leonardo DiCaprio (duh) -Beautiful island, waterfall, beach, longhouse.

But I do hate this movie for ruining the book. They changed the plot too much, and all-in-all I don't really mind that too much. But they completely missed the point of the book, and the filming didn't show any of the mystery atmosphere that I felt when I read the book. The only good idea in the filming department that I saw was how they showed Richard's game of picking dope as a computer game. But I was disappointed about how Mr. Duck played a very small role in the movie, and his accent stopped me from actually understanding a single word he was saying (DVD had no subtitles). And another big disappointment- they completely missed out Jed, one of the main characters! But, I guess, this movie would seem better to me if I hadn't read the book first. I kept comparing the two which distracted me from enjoying it. Conclusion: The movie is watchable, but the book is so much better. The film-makers wanted to make the movie more 'Hollywood' (love affairs, overdramatised action scenes, etc.) and ended up twisting the plot too much and missed the actual point and atmosphere of the book.",neg
theBeach,Argh! So much left out of the original story!,6/10,screamer-13,19/2/2000,"Bit of a disappointment here I'm afraid. The book was riveting, but the film attempts to get away with Blu-Tack. ...(?)... As usual Leonardo Di Craprio is nauseatingly.....nauseating (why do people ever give him parts which require him to look happy?? He just looks so utterly stupid!). The plot is not very gripping, hardly any of the characters are fleshed out at all (because there are so many of them? the book certainly managed to include a lot more detail), and certain parts of the story are played upon too much at the expense of others (e.g. Daffy, who is dead, at the expense of Richard's relationships with Francoise, Sal, Keaty, etc). Watching it, I felt rather more analytical than usual, which probably demonstrates my lack of immersion in the film. The main problem for someone who has read the book is that so much is left out. Then I think of the people who haven't read it, and realise all that they are missing out on, because in just 2 hours they have seen something which may ruin their enjoyment of an excellent and thrilling novel. Final comments: Leo should die; that French chick was HOT!; what is it with kickass soundtracks in films these days?",neg
theBeach,"Book is better, but movie ain't bad",6/10,Godfather,9/2/2000,"The book is definitely better, but as adaptations go, this one isn't too bad. The 1st half is actually pretty faithful, if a bit too condensed, but it does get a bit messy and over-long towards the end. Not a masterpiece by any standards but certainly not as bad as they say. I'm not a Leo fan but honestly thought his performance was spot on. Also some excellent cinematography by Frenchman Darius Khondji (Seven, Delicatessen).

I must be honest in my review, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for the first hour or so, after that I was lost. I simply loved the beautiful photography and panoramic views, they were simply breath-taking. I found myself actually sitting on the edge of my seat during some of the movies' early action sequences. But, someone please explain to me what happened to this movie that had so much potential before the script fell apart ? I actually commented to my a friend who attended the movie with me, why did this movie end before the story did ? And, as I sit here and write my review I thought of the reason this movie just did not work all that well for me. It was the glaring absence of Gilligan, Mary Anne, The Professor..oh yes and the Skipper too. A two hour movie that was much like a three hour cruise. All in all I gave the movie a 7, what can I say I'm feeling generous tonight.

theBeach,"Different than the book, same problems as the book",7/10,frmertedd,15/2/2000,"Read the book over the summer, really liked it in a Fight Club kind of way. Post gen-X stereotype stories that actually speak to me and my frustrations. But I thought the book got muddled near the end, especially in the return of Daffy to the proceedings. That was even more extreme in the movie. As soon as Richard goes crazy, Boyle went for a schizophrenic non-linear extended montage, all of which took away from the rest of the film. If insanity was presented as matter of factly as paradise was, with composed scenes, instead of images, it would have been more powerful as well as more satisfying. Dicaprio, as usual, was top notch.

theBeach,mediocre,5/10,zza99tmk,15/2/2000,"When I went to see ""The Beach"" I did so rather curiously than with high expectations, though it was the latest work of Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald. There were so many negative headlines surrounding the picture (the -according to the press- disastrous shootings in Thailand and Ewan McGregor going public with his disappointment about his friends jumping ship on him when they decided to give Leo the leading role), that I was just wondering if the film would reflect all this. First of all is the story basically interesting: the protagonists look for new excitement in their life and try to redeem themselves from the boredom of life in a society, which can't offer them new perspectives (a story element which had been described in Finchers ""Fight Club"" before). In the first half, ""The Beach"" is a decent film: you really get a sense for this alternative society and lifestyle thanks to Boyles understatement. Darius Khondjis cinematography is -as always- most impressive. The crux is the sudden change in the second part of the film: Since we haven't been given any clues before about the dark side of Richards character, this change in his personality and therefore the change in the tone of the picture comes the more unexpected and not plausible. There's a reference to ""Apocalypse Now"" but since the film leaves it to that, this storytwist simply doesn't work at all. I haven't read Garlands novel but since Hodge admitted to have shortened the plot (running time and so on..)I just suppose that the novel goes far more into details about Richard's innerlife and gives you a better preparation for what is to come. Moreover Boyles stylistic methods are inappropriate for the climax of the story: the video game references are ludicrous as basically the second part as a whole is strangely uninvolving. The result is a film, which -as ""Fight Club""- starts off in style but then derails terribly in the end. Truly, you recognize it as Danny Boyles film and not as Fox's picture, but despite that I hope that the trio comes back to Britain and make again the good films they became famous for (""Shallow Grave"" and in parts ""Trainspotting"").",neg
theBeach,A different film for a different generation,7/10,CaptRon-2,12/2/2000,"A surprising film with beautiful locations. This movie deals more with the concepts of man against man, man against nature, and finally, and most importantly, man against himself. This is more the kind of movie that the 25 - 45 year old crowd would like more that the raves of teenage girls that may be disappointed in Leo's character. The movie actually rates a 6.5 but half points aren't allowed. Perhaps the message to be gotten from this film is that paradise is from within, not from a place.

theBeach,Just kinda blah (*possible spoilers*),6/10,queen_medea,14/2/2000,"Am I the only one who felt like I was watching two different movies? There was the generic ""idyllic paradise"" movie, and the ""Richard wigs out kinda out of nowhere"" movie. The two parts just didn't seem to match up and the ending left me feeling kind of unsatisfied. During the ""idyllic paradise"" section, there wasn't much action, just the establishment of the beach community and the characters; I kept waiting for something to happen, and when it did (ie: Richard's breakdown), it seemed to come right out of leftfield-there had been no previous evidence to indicate that he would have a breakdown like that. I read a little bit of the book in a bookstore, and right from the start it establishes the fascination Richard has with the Vietnam war and how his fantasies will eventually become reality, and I think the movie could have benefitted from a little foreshadowing. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was good, not his best, but still good. Danny Boyle's direction seemed nonexistent until Richard's breakdown. Up until then, there was nothing of Boyle's style to indicate that he was indeed directing the film, it looked like it could have been done by any director. Somewhat disappointing. As far as Leo's return to the big screen goes, ""The Beach"" is just kind of mediocre....although he does look good without a shirt--sorry, just my hormones creeping in there, I'm actually a mature, intelligent adult. Go see it for the Leo eye candy, otherwise, wait for video.",neg
theBeach,Exceptional First 1/2 hour; Loses it's Focus in Middle,6/10,Cochese-6,14/2/2000,"Being a big Danny Boyle fan, I was a little disappoiinted by ""The Beach."" However, I must say the first 1/2 hour was as good as any work he has done in the past. The beginning let's you get to know and identify with Richard (Leonardo Dicaprio) a lost, uncomfortable American traveler, who, like so many is anxious to try something ""new."" The script by the always dependable John Hodge captures Richard's mood perfectly. Another fantastic element of ""The Beach"" is Robert Carlyle's appearence as Daffy, a spontaneous and exciting character who remains the real center of Richard's state of mind throughout his wild stay on the beach.

After the first hour, however, the film begins to stumble as Richard's mood begins to shift and this transition simply feels too rushed. Dicaprio turns in a good performance, however the other characters remain rather flat. Even though the film is strictly about Richard and what he represents, they could have built more on his relationship with Etienne (Guillame Canet) and especially Francoise, (Virginie Ledoyen) not to mention the others on the beach. The film is also tremendously visual, as Boyle continues to make the settings just as large a part of the story as his characters.

By the end the themes feel complete,(They are reminiscent of some in ""Fight Club"" in an odd way) however the story comes up short.",neg
theBeach,"Not a Beach Party film afterall, but it wasn't meant to be.",8/10,Reno-16,13/2/2000,"What did you expect...? Well, you have this young man who is on a ""journey"" and along the way, he ends up in a tree.... So, he put himself there along with his traveling companions and the people he meets. Well, he has to undergo a transformation of character ... blah, blah, blah ... hopefully for the better, and resolve the situation so that he can continue his journey as a somewhat enlightened or changed person. Well, I guess this film was a little ""Greek"" to most of the reviewers and probably to many of the ""male"" members of the audience so far. Though, it seems that most of the young women that have seen the film have picked up on the subtle nuances of Richard's story. Well, maybe not, could be just a subconscious thing going here with Leo. However, the film is not as bad as all that. It says a lot about pop culture and Western influence spreading to every remote corner of the world. Including Westerners, who have gone to the remote corners to escape their own cultural imperialism. But, you can't run away from yourself....or your culture... or ..whatever. Anyway ... in some primitive ways the natives still rule in a primitive society.

I liked the hommage to APOCALYPSE NOW. It is one of my favorite films. I think you could throw in a little LORD OF THE FLIES here too. I liked the way that the film showed the influence of Consumer Technology in Southeast Asia, where of course, most of the products are manufactured today. ""Poor Richard"" just couldn't get away from it all....the music, images, tourists, etc. were everywhere. Well, if he wasn't staying at The Admiral Ben Bow Inn, he wouldn't have gotten the treasure map. He almost got the black spot near the end too ... but you can't kill off the young hero .. he has to complete his journey or undergo a change ... I think I covered this already. I liked the bit where he spaced out and imagined himself as a character in a computer game. Also, I thought that it was a very nice touch at the end, where he logged on and received the photo that represented a brief moment of paradise in the universe.",pos
theBeach,critics attack The Beach like sharks,7/10,Marcos Devilboy,13/2/2000,"There are certainly some confusing elements to The Beach and, in it's ambition to acheive more than mere entertainment, it occasionally loses it's head of steam. However, the film nonetheless has a number of things going for it, not the least of which are the actors, the locations and the wonderful homage it pays to a number of films from the past, including Lord of the Flies and Appocolypse Now. And that doesn't mean the film is lacking story, it's got more than enough of that to sustain interest over two hours.

I have been surprised to note that many critics have attacked the movie and I can't help but think this is largely because they don't like Leo, perhaps feeling a male hero must surface only in the mold of a Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford. I'm glad to see the sensitive guy get a chance and, Roger Ebert's approval or not, Leo is compelling and believable.

It's not a great movie but it's a real good one and if you wanna go on a trip for two hours I'd certainly reccomend you head for The Beach.",pos
theBeach,It Could Have Been Better,6/10,JEH-4,13/2/2000,"The Beach has a lot going for it - stunning photography, great music, a pretty good story - but in the end it fails to be more than light entertainment. The main fault is Leonardo di Caprio's inappropriateness for the role of Richard - an edgy, thrill-seeking Englishman in the book, a nice middle-class American boy in the movie. The character doesn't develop and Leo seems to have settled on three or four expressions that will do on all occasions. Tilda Swinton and especially Robert Carlyle act rings around Leo, bringing the movie briefly to life when they're on the screen.

theBeach,Something completely different then the previews!,6/10,Jeru-9,13/2/2000,"Whoa,

Coming into this movie I was expecting sort of an action/adventure. Leo vs. the drug dealers to save the island...that sort of thing. Completely wrong.

The movie is a wild trip into the mind of a guy who thinks he's found perfection. It's all about the beginnings of perfections and ultimate loss of perfection that is inevitable.

I'm sort of a Leo fan, but I thought his performance in this was pretty stellar. He's funny, but in parts where his character breaks down, he's very un-Leoish.

Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) brings together the piece really well. At points I thought the movie was rough around the edges and at other times I thought the movie was too perfect. He creates some beautiful scenes though, look for the part involving ""Video-Game Richard,"" especially good.

A major beef was the sound track. Way too poppy and pleasant in the whole ""revelation"" scenes.

Go see it though. Figure it out for yourself.",pos
theBeach,"Visually magnificient, well-acted, great film...",8/10,dtomlinson,13/2/2000,"The first misconception about The Beach is that because Leonardo DiCaprio is in it that it will be another cheesy love story like Titanic... People are quick to forget, that DiCaprio, despite being a poster boy for 14-year-old girls, can act... If anyone needs proof of that, they can rent This Boy's Life, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Basketball Diaries etc...

While The Beach is not as good as the book, the movie is very strong, exciting and can hold your attention for the full two hours... DiCaprio is great, as is Virginie Ledoyen (The gorgeous little Frenchy) who plays his love interest...

The previews make this look like a chick flick to get the women who want to see DiCaprio to the theatres... In reality, it is very dark, and very enjoyable for anyone who wants to see it...

A really good, mixture of category's, horror, mystery, drama, adventure... Although It was not too realistic at times. Good acting, good story, and a good setting. It was a real paradise, It made me want to stay in my seat and I could not move!

But like all movie stars after one big film hit they get a funky haircut, put some glasses on and go shopping for clothes in the second hand store. This is what Leon' done... He now looks like Daffy duck with plastic surgery. Theres always one explanation: to get into a magazine!

Although, this isnt the first crazy trend he's tried to start, he really did confuse me in the Beach, I liked him in Titanic better. But still a stunning performance in the Beach.\4****star rating/

theBeach,Interesting...for lack of a better word,6/10,Fulcrum,1/4/2002,"I went into watching this film with no expectations whatsoever (sometimes the best way to watch a film) but was left with a feeling of unfulfillment. I didn't realize this was from the same director that guided Shallow Grave and Trainspotting to two of the best films I've ever seen, I think he could have done better. Still, the acting was good, the format and cinematography great. The second shark scene was terrifying and the repercussions afterwards equally disturbing. Unlike others, I liked the video game immersion scene but I get the impression the book did a better job in explaining his infatuation with video games. I was left shaking my head of Richard's final emotion when reminiscing. I'd have the complete opposite reaction. 6/10

It does have some parts that don't really work, and a couple of bad actors. It had the potential to be really excellent. The story is really unique, and intriguing. It's also quite scary - especially the start, in the scene with Daffy. It also had really good effects - the computer game bit freaked me out. Leonardo DiCaprio did a pretty good job in it. Especially in the part where he has to retrieve the map. Everyone will hate Sal, which means she's a good actress, because you're supposed to hate her. Overall it's a pretty good movie, and you should see it.

theBeach,Ignore the critics--this is a good film!,8/10,Kiwi-7,24/1/2002,"Critics didn't like this film. Roger Ebert, whose reviews I generally find insightful and on target, gave it just 2 stars and called it ""seriously confused"". On the IMDB hit parade, it only rates about 6 stars. Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous ""Trainspotting"". Then my teenage daughter came home from a party where she and her friends had watched it, and she said, ""It's brilliant! You HAVE to see it, Mum!""

So, we rented the video, and I'm glad we did. The Beach is an interesting and solid film that tells an intriguing, if somewhat episodic, story in a stylish way. DiCaprio is, indeed, excellent as a young man searching for life's ultimate experiences, and getting more than he bargained for. This is a loss-of-innocence story, a sort of cross between Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the musical The Fantastics. Director Danny Boyle leads us on Richard's journey to the Heart of Darkness in an energetic, stylish way--filming is interesting and beautiful--and he gets excellent results from his actors. The use of Richard's voice-over as narrative--often a distraction in films--here offers a certain amount of adolescent profundity and acuteness of observation, and it works.

I've been a traveller in Thailand. Although Richard's quest and Richard's scene wasn't mine, I've seen it...the beaches, the bars, the snake blood, the dope, the parties. I've also been a high school teacher, and have worked with adolescents hungry to discover ""the real world"", to bite into Eve's apple with gusto. Many from New Zealand head off in their late teens/early twenties on ""The Great OE"" (Overseas Experience). The same is undoubtedly true for many Australians and Brits, if not so commonly for American youth. So there's a strong element of ""truth"" in this story.

Don't listen to the critics. This is a good, solid film with an interesting perceptive story, fine performances, and a stylish presentation. Four stars out of five.",pos
theBeach,Excellent as a standalone movie,7/10,exousir,20/8/2001,"I have not read the novel that this screenplay is based on, so I cannot comment on that respect.

As a film in it's own right, the direction was rather interesting. Pop culture was left behind for an alternative culture. But then, at what point does alternative culture become popular? This is much the same with alternative musics/culture today. Perhaps, the spiral into savagery and madness could have been more dark.

The cinematography was breathtaking and the soundtrack well selected for the above mentioned theme. One criticism is that the direction seemed to almost flagrantly look 'arthouse'.

7 out of 10. Less if you have read the novel.

The acting was believable enough for me, and also I thought the use of pop (and not so pop) music was done well. As for content, The Beach raises deep issues on how we deal with our own existence, experience, sanity and commitments to other people: there did seem to be more noble purpose than just speculating in the emotions of the viewer. Although many find fault with the film, I think - at very least - it deserves credit for the choice of material, and credit for having brought this material to fruition in the form of a Hollywood movie.

theBeach,I don't really know what to think of this movie **spoilers**,6/10,ShannonAmidala,11/7/2001,"Kudos to the cinematographer of this movie- he really outdid himself. The scenery was magnificently beautiful, and captured the idyllic essence of paradise perfectly. If there was one overall strength in this movie, the cinematography is it. I'm on vacation in Thailand, and me and my mom were watching it...we were like ""Wow"" . It really is gorgeous.

That being said, I have to wholeheartedly agree with the person that said ""Huh?"" The plot was very weak (if there was one at all). The second half of the film really messed me up inside. I did not get where the story was going, or where it had gone. Leonardo DiCaprio, a seemingly pretty boy, did exceed my expectations in this role. A few times he was kind of ""iffy"", but overall he was terrific as Richard. Virginie Ledoyen, as the beautiful Francoise whom takes a liking to Richard, is marvelously gorgeous, but didn't get the screentime she adored. Near the end, when Sal is just about to shoot Richard, I'm wondering why Francoise isn't helping him. She could like jump out in front of him and do that ""take me instead"" thing. If she really likes Richard the way that she says she does, wouldn't she help him over Etienne? Whatever. On that same note, in fact, I wish that the relationship between Richard and Francoise was developed more, and was given more screentime. AND on that note...what in the world was Richard doing with Sal? Grrr...

The movie was very suspenseful, very confusing, and, at times, a little pointless. But it was a beautiful, harrowing, two-faced adventure that was worth the money. :)",neg

Hopefully, his solid performance in this movie can break some of the romantic stereotypes that ""Titanic"" cast upon him. The movie tells the tale of a young American abroad who is in search of ""something different."" The story has something interesting to say about a variety of issues from the environment to the nature of tourism and life. A good storyline, good acting, great direction, and a gorgeous leading lady make for a very entertaining and interesting movie.

theBeach,DiCaprio's celebrity overshadows.,8/10,paulcreeden,20/3/2001,"DiCaprio fever seems to have obscured the worth of this film on its own merits. His celebrity seems to have overshadowed and killed serious criticism of this film, I believe. If ""Lord of the Flies"" is seen as a reference, I think a case can be made that this film makes some very powerful and effective statements about classic Utopianism among the children of the jaded and bored richer classes. DiCaprio plays his spoiled American very well. The young man is a great actor. The role of Tilda Swinton is well written, but I think she made her character too intelligent and complex with her excellent, but intense, acting. The jockish and superficial tribe members were much more convincing. I loved the international casting. The cast and the setting are visual knock outs. Robert Carlyle brought his ""Trainspotting"" insanity to the film, but I think his character was written over the top. Paterson Joseph, as Keaty, was a stand out. Guillame Canet, as Etienne, worked well as the tortured cast off in his particular love triangle. It took two viewings of this film for me to see past its stunning visuals and over-the-top highs and lows to appreciate it for its intelligent themes. If you disliked it the first time, you might give it another try.",pos

theBeach,For the wandering type,8/10,almaier,26/1/2001,"Although this film has been trashed terribly, there are some of us who actually really liked this film.

Maybe it's the traveller in me, but this film about the search to find, and create the ultimate paradise, is actually quite affecting. From personal experience, I find the colony of backpackers that live in the Beach community to be very realistic. I've met these people! Di Caprio is actually quite good as a frat boy kind of American and Swinton is great as the community's dictatorial leader.

Don't see this film expecting a repeat of the book. Few films are as good as the book, we all know that. But for those of you with a traveller's heart and for those of you who dream of finding the perfect paradise, I'd say this film is an exotic and refreshing and worth your time.

Sure there are some parts, like the video-game sequence where Richard goes all Lord of the Flies that is a bit ridiculous. But all in all, it's escapist and rather sad and examines the downfall of a paradise.",pos
theBeach,Disappointing.,7/10,Ohtar,23/1/2001,"Fair enough this film has superb scenery, a great plot, and decent actors, however I cannot help but to be disappointed with the adaption. It is in Boyle's style but it isn't suited to the film, if you have read the book then I'm sure you will agree that it could have been much better - the viewer should watch the film and then fail to understand how they could ever leave such a place. Too much time is concentrated on Daffy and Richard following his path, unlike in the novel. Also, I think it is appropriate to mention here that it is left open nicely to either a sequel or prequel. This film could have been an epic!

theBeach,"The Book is better, but Virginie is only in the movie",8/10,xentar-2,4/1/2001,"First, i´m not Leo`s fun. I think he is one of very talented young actors, but after Titanic had no chance to prove it. Earlier i saw the movie, only after that i have red the book. What i like in this movie is that everytime i watch it i feel like Richard. It could be so funny to escape of civilization, find your own paradise island and live there until the end of my life /but only with a girl like francoise/. I also love exteriors of this movie, great work of camera, absolutely perfect soundtrack and acting of some of the actors/Robert Carlyle, Tilda Swinton - she is exactly as Sal in the book/. My dislike of this movie is that it doesn´t know what it want to say. Is it lookin´for a real life ? Or to show how interests of group are more than life of its member ? Eight stars is very much, but six for movie and two for beauty of Thailand and Virginie Ledoyen sounds better. You should certainly see it and make your own opinion.

theBeach,The journey is more exciting than the destination,6/10,Junker-2,29/10/2000,"I really enjoyed the first 40 or so minutes of ""The Beach."" Richard, Francoise and Etienne's journey to The Beach is full of fun, adventure and romance. Unfortunately, guess what happens about a third of the way into this movie? They find The Beach! And we quickly realize that, as is often the case, the journey was far more exciting than the destination.

Once at The Beach we find too many characters with too little to do. And while the movie focuses heavily upon Richard (Leo, of course) the other characters are largely forgotten. Even Francoise (played by the lovely Virginie Ledoyen), who is so vital to the first half of this movie, is largely forgotten in the second half.

The main failing of ""The Beach"" can be summed up by the character of Sal, the leader of The Beach. Without giving away the climatic moment of the movie, Sal becomes the pivotal character in that climax. However, we have learned so little about her up to that point that we simply have no emotional attachment to her character. The climax which should have been a ""Wow!"" is instead a ""Ho-hum.""

I suppose there are attempts here to make some political and social comments in regard to this utopia the characters have found, but I'm afraid this ain't no ""Lord of the Flies."" I wish the makers of this movie would start over from the top again. This time, have Richard and his friends keep searching, maybe come close, but never actually find The Beach.",neg
theBeach,"Electrifying and Interesting, but flawed.",7/10,movie_maniac_mike,3/10/2000,"**********THE BEACH**********

The Plot: Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American backpacker, is willing to risk his life for just one thing: that mind-blowing rush you can only get from braving the ultimate adventure. But on a secret, deceptively perfect beach, he'll soon discover that, as the level of intensity rises and the stakes climb higher, desire grows stronger...and danger grows deeper. 73%

The Acting: Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off another winner, his performance is electrifying and powerful. Newcomers Virgine Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet also put in amazing efforts for their debut feature films. Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle are among the more known people of this movie, and they are ultimately impressive. 79%

The Screenplay/Directing: John Hodge, who directed Trainspotting, has obviously decided to take a turn for writing. His screenplay is well-adapted from Alex Gardland's novel, and although it weakens near the end, he still keeps you wrapped up in all the brilliantly confusing plot twists. Danny Boyle, director, went to amazing hights to make this film successful, and he deserves praise. 80%

Other: Some chilling sound and mind-blowing cinematography. 70%

Overall: The Beach is an interesting, intriguing and different film, and although it is as times deeply flawed, it is still an immensly powerful and watchable film. Recommended. 74%

theBeach,Hmmm . . .,7/10,gregory.mitchell,26/9/2000,"Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)-

- The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example). It just doesn't seem to work as smoothly and perfectly as Trainspotting, altho The Beach isn't *that* bad a flick.

- One thing another poster mentions is the Beautiful People mold that the Beach inhabitants seem to have been mass produced from. While there is a false sense of glamour and youth in the casting of thin/young/beautiful people, maybe that lends itself as a stark contrast to the very dire circumstances and consequences of their actions. These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions. Well, maybe not - but it makes me feel better to think that, either way ;).",pos
theBeach,Missed the Boat,6/10,Ethan.H.Field,3/9/2000,"DiCaprio is over exposed in this difficult movie dedicated to the psychology of the advanced backpacker. Some Backpackers do their time and go back to start their careers while some want to drag out the process. The constant search for better drugs, a better beach, a better party... The locale is well researched. Dope growing in that area is a viable alternative to fishing. The ""Beach"" does exist but you don't need a secret map to find it. The problem with the film is that we get too much Leonardo. The film would have benefited from a more egalitarian distribution of screen time. Less star power and more characterization. Other characters are barely traced. To create the ""alternative universe"" we needed to get to know its members. The shark attack and aftermath would have had greater impact had we cared more for the unfortunates attacked. With DiCaprio recruited for the project it must have been too much to ask of the makers not to milk him for what it was worth despite the effect this had on the finished flick. Not having read the book I cannot comment on the adaptation, however I suspect that it is an individual's odyssey, which may be a problem for any film adaptation.",neg
theBeach,Builds up to nowhere..,6/10,G-LuV,18/8/2000,"So we meet our title character (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) trying to find a real vacation in Asia. I wont go to much into the story, but he finds a map to a supposable ""paradise island"" with the perfect beach. The story builds up well, as him and his two companions set out for the island.. avoiding a group of thai drug smugglers, and finally reach the beach.

And then well.. then.. nothing. It builds up to nothing. We watch a dull romance sequence between Leo and Francois. Leo goes mad and trapes around the jungle, and then its over.

It was doing okay, but once he got to the beach I get the distinct impression that the writer said ""well now what?"", and finished the end of the story with filler material. A (I think generous) ""6"".

A fan of the novel, this is a better movie than we had a right to expect; you have to accept changes when making a movie and the film-makers have made an often different version which should be viewed on its own where it stands up as a good movie. The actors are good, the story is pacy and the photography is beautiful. An exciting and enjoyable movie.

theBeach,"Good movie, but Boyle's weakest.",8/10,Funky A,7/8/2000,"The Beach is a good movie but it could have been better. The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise. And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing. It was made by the usual Danny Boyle-John Hodge team, but someone is missing: Ewan McGregor. McGregor would have been perfect as Richard, but instead, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who got the role. While DiCaprio is not a bad actor, he is not a good one either. He can't ruin a movie by himself, but he can't make it better. He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma. And that lack of charisma is made even more evident in the scenes between him and Robert Carlyle, which gives an awesome performance in a small role. When both actors are on screen, DiCaprio disappears. Virginie Ledoyen was chosen because she is absolutely gorgeous, not because of her acting talent. Her performance as Françoise is barely okay. The rest of the cast is good. Tilda Swinton shows the obsession of her character very well. There is, as in any Boyle movie, an excellent soundtrack which includes such artists as Moby, Blur, The Chemical Brothers, UNKLE, Asian Dub Foundation, Underworld and New Order. Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet). The photography is Oscar-worthy. As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one. Also, the love story is not very well done and too predictable. But despite some flaws, this is still an interesting movie. I also believe it is better to have already seen Shallow Grave before seeing this one, as it tackles similar themes shown in a very different way. It is fun to see how Boyle includes them in is most commercial movie yet(and hopefully, ever).

theBeach,Good flick about paradise lost,8/10,aristoie,12/2/2000,"I thought the beach was a good flick depicting that paradise is not what is around you but rather an attitude. No matter how nice the external surroundings are the interal condition of yourself is what makes or breaks ""your paradise"". Side note - the chick is one of the most beautiful girls I've seen hit the screen in a long time.

theBeach,Forget any high expectations and you will enjoy this...,8/10,spacemonkey_m,15/7/2000,"First things first: Many of you will approach this movie with much trepidation - or not approach at all - because of the star. But, he's really not as bad as you might think. Di Caprio is swept up in a tale of a breathtaking paradise found and subsequently violently lost (a la ""Lord of The Flies"").

The first mention goes to Alex Garland and John Hodge. Garland, who wrote an excellent novel (and actually worked as the cartographer for the map you see in the film) has been followed by a script which manages to maintain the major plot-points and keeps the shock impact of particular events. In fact, some of the more interesting little touches (e.g. drinking ""Snakeblood"", and the lists of necessities given to Di Caprio's Richard before he leaves for the dreaded mainland) are absent in the original and solely invented by Hodge. The dialogue is also a revelation, with many quotable standouts (e.g. ""And as for travelling alone, f**k it. If that's the way it has to be, then that's the way it is).

My sole criticism (before I get to the praise) would be the final third of the movie when Richard turns his stint in the jungle into a hallucinatory and adrenalin-fuelled commando game. This is not properly signposted and therefore happens too soon, leaving those who have not read the novel rather bemused. As we have lost the character of Jed (the general 'security guard') Richard's fixation with 'Nam movies needs to spelled out more clearly at the beginning of the movie (a one-second glimpse of ""Apocalypse Now"" is not enough), and his heady thrill of the action should be more enthusiastically and obviously portrayed.

OK, the overall experience is one of beauty, mystery and pure entertainment. The cinematography is wonderful, as Darius Khondji (who couldn't be further from the dark and malevolent ""Se7en"") captures the idyllic splendour of the island perfectly and awe-inspiringly - don't miss the end credits either, where the photography is given time to breathe over the backing of UNKLE's ""Lonely Soul"".

The soundtrack is again outstanding, comprising Moby's tearful Porcelain with exclusives from Dario G, Faithless and Underworld. The Boyle/Macdonald/Hodge team have always produced sensational soundtracks and here they score again.

The fresh cast are again pitch-perfect, with newcomers Virginie Ledoyen (as the object of Richard's affection) and Guillaume Canet standouts, while Tilda Swinton is intruiging as Sal (the community's obsessive leader). In hindsight, Di Caprio suits the role more and gives a performance of considerably more aplomb than Titanic's Jack and Romeo and Juliet's, er, Romeo.

Go in with minimal expectations (as I did) and you will enjoy this; but if you really hate Di Caprio that much, just don't bother...",pos
theBeach,The book and movie,8/10,DuckieMah,5/7/2000,"Compared to the book, the movie didn't follow the story as well as it should have. Visually the movie did an amazing job of the book. The actual scenario was underplayed in the book and it bothers me when movies miss things in the book or add things in that didn't happen. The Beach did both of those things. See the movie first, because for a movie its a good movie. If you read the book first, and judge it as a book/movie, you won't be as impressed with it. Its worth seeing full price for.

Virginie Leyoden's first American film and she looks great, plot wise, however, the movie falls a bit short. Made by Danny ""TRAINSPOTTING"" Boyle, it features the same kind of cinematography which I cannot explain but those who have seen both know what I mean. Leo does an alright job, nothing spectacular. If you love tropical locations (and who doesn't!) see this movie at once.

theBeach,Don't listen to the critics!,8/10,Mes-3,21/3/2000,"After Leonardo DiCaprio's very ordinary and in my opinion senseless academy nomination for his role in `Titanic', it took some time, till the rumours about his new film `The Beach' spread around. I mostly heard things like, they want to bring it into this years academy awards, or this whole environment stuff that went on because off the set building on the island. Next thing were the critics, when the film was released and their opinions about how worse `The Beach' was. Seeing the first trailer actually raised memories on `Lord of the flies' and quite weak stories about bad guys and good guys. Then the different opinions of my own friends and the belief in Leonardo as a quite good actor, as films before `Titanic' reflected, lead me into the cinema a few days ago.

And I was surprised how good this film actually was. The first few minutes showed an American Boy in a state of life, where we all want to travel around the world, escape from reality, school or university life. Just have fun and see what the world has to offer, if there is the possibility for a better life. The film had some interesting and realistic scenes from Asiatic city life, which partly reminded me, of Hong Kong. Then the idea was raised, that there might be an island, just perfect, incredible and unique. It is the reflection of a picture taken from a dream. And that's actually what the life on this island seems to be. People try to live a dream because they are sick of the hectically way our own society offers. I loved the camera images when Richard and Sal came back into the city. It was like entering a sick, wrong world. But the beach is peaceful and they try to keep it that way as long as possible. But as it is very natural, everything turns into chaos and nothing lasts forever. This maybe is cliché, but looking at the fact that even planet earth, won't be there anymore in the far future, gives a realistic, thrilling touch. The perfect dream is nothing more than a soap bubble. So reality bites in form of a shark, in form of Richard who gave the map of the island away. People were killed, the harmony totally destroyed and the dream is gone.

Richard himself is an interesting developing actor. Typical American kid, which is shown in his computer imaging mind, of the shark attack and the war game in the jungle. That's an interesting part of the film when Richard is supposed to get the map back. In his state of boredom, while not knowing what to do, he fades back into a computer society kid, that has nothing else to do when bored, than playing war games and stuff. He mixes this with the aim to get the card back and develops some kind of `fixed idea', that he might have learned so much strategy and hero images in computer games to reconstruct them which turns him nearly into a maniac.

The great camera work in the film, the acting and the plot are underlined by a wonderful soundtrack. And against most opinions I think this film is worth watching. At least to built an own opinion. I haven't read the book yet. But I'll put it on my `To-Do'-List.",pos
theBeach,"#$% the critics, this movie is good",8/10,Marc-201,20/3/2000,"Although burnt down by critics here in Holland, I really liked this movie.The movie never ceased to amuse me with one of the climaxes being the videogame sequence. The movie starts pretty sweet but when the tension mounts it really grips you. The references to ""apocalypse now"" also contribute to the movie because both sort of have the same central theme. Go see it is absolutely fabulous

I did not read the book it was based on, so I'm unable to comment on how well it represents the source material. I do think the video game footage took away from the film. It wasn't necessary to create the illusion of dementia. I don't know if Leo was the perfect casting choice, but it worked. Virginie Ledoyen was nice to look at, but did not bring much to the film in regards to acting ability. The location shooting on that island was just breathtaking. It was some of the most beautiful footage that I've ever seen. I thought the backpack culture premise was interesting. Overall, the film gets a 5 out of 10.

Having read nothing before about this movie, I was fully prepared to have a wonderful time after the first minutes of The Beach. The music's good and the imagery created is very strong. So strong in fact that I didn't even notice at first that the last half of the film is totally unconvincing and weak in terms of story and dialogue. Perhaps reading the novel will shed some light on some unexplained parts of Richard's character.

Anyway, it wasn't a complete waste of time and money: I enjoyed even the weak scenes because I instantly fell in love with the wonderful Virginie Ledoyen. Sigh.

theBeach,"Tisk, tisk.",7/10,PreOre72,7/3/2000,"""Oh my god everyone Leo has a new movie coming out."" That is basically what happens when Leonardo DiCaprio's name is even uttered since becoming a teen heartthrob in 1997's Best Picture ""Titanic"". Unfortunately people don't remember Leo's best work playing Johnny Depp's mentally challenged little brother Arnie, which earned him his only Oscar nomination, in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". His new film ""The Beach"" was the victim of mass hype hurting your opinion of the film before you even see it because you are just expecting something more than it is.

Leo portrays Richard, a young traveler from America, who is looking to do more than just the usual tourist type activities. Luckily his hotel room is next door to Daffy Duck's. That is the alias of the next door neighbor, played by Robert Carlyle, who tells Richard about this ""perfect"" beach out in the pacific. Daffy draws Richard a map and continues his own little descent into insanity. Richard takes him up on the offer asking a young French couple, played by Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet, who also accept the offer.

The young travelers go on their journey and find the beach, which is inhabited by a whole village of 20 somethings. Richard and company think they are in paradise but as the tagline says ""innocence never lasts forever"".

I'll leave the rest shot in the air because Richard goes on his own little surreal journey into madness, trying to fight what's real with what's not.

The film was well directed by Trainspotting alumni Danny Boyle but the story itself is simply lacking. The film as a whole was put together well with beautiful cinematography, courtesy of the Thailand filming locations, but unfortunately it just wasn't written or told very well. Sometimes that just happens. I do have to say that I did enjoy the ""videogame"" scene with Richard tramping through the woods.

All in all a well made film but lacking in story and plot. ""The Beach"" just became very uninteresting once everybody stopped having fun because then neither do you.

theBeach,Could have been so much better!,5/10,main.smith,3/3/2000,"With talented Director Danny Boyle calling the shots, with a best selling novel as material, and with arguably Hollywood's biggest star Leonardo Di Caprio as the lead, you'd be forgiven for expecting The Beach to be something a bit special.

I expected one of the films of the year. I left disappointed.

I should point out right away that I did read Garland's novel months earlier, and being a huge fan, it's quite hard to judge Boyle's film merely as a film. Making comparisons between film and book was almost impossible, so if faced with the choice between the two, I would recommend watching the film first.

To be fair, those experiencing the story for the first time through Boyle's film will probably find it quite entertaining. Certainly no classic, but watchable nonetheless, with some decent performances headed by Di Caprio, and some beautiful filming.

Fans of the novel though should prepare to be disappointed. The story is no where near as intriguing, several good supporting characters are left to just fade into the tropical background, and the actions of those who do hog all the camera time aren't true to Garland's excellent novel.

The most annoying example of this is Richard's eventual madness. While the novel has Richard's fears and suspicions of his apparent paradise developed gradually, Boyle has Richard seemingly fine and content one minute, and raving mad the next.

In addition, Richard's unrequited love for Francoise, the cause of some interesting, silent, sexual tension in the novel, is replaced by a passionate love triangle. Not content, with just this, Boyle decides to completely change Garland's story by adding a slight change to the ending.

As I said earlier, those unfamiliar with the story will probably enjoy the Beach, with it offering some simple, escapist entertainment with some sex appeal.

Garland fans won't be able to help feeling a little disappointed. This is a lazily constructed, loosely based adaptation, saved only by some half decent performances, some wonderful cinematography, and the obvious appeal of a bikini clad Virginie Ledoyen.

Not terrible, but a sad case of wasted potential.",neg

The first hour is almost great,right from the very first shot. It's all very stylish, colourful,with an excellent cinematography.The Carlyle cameo is very good, the female lead is pretty wonderful, Tilda Swinton plays Sal in exactly the way I expected the character to be, and DiCaprio is not everywhere. There are flaws here and there, of course:the screenplay doesn't follows the original story too much,Leo almost gets the girl-or should I say girls?-but all in all everything's shaping up quite nicely. Then everything goes wrong,and the last 30-40 minutes are almost embarrassing, from a gung-ho Leo to the confrontation with the drug dealers-completely different to what happens in the movie-to the final escape. Here,the movie loses its balance, It's Leo,Leo,Leo everywhere, and it all goes downhill. Too bad. Still, there are some beautiful moments, the cast is pretty nice, the soundtrack is fabulous,but it could have been much much better. Rating:6 Oh, and DiCaprio is not THAT great an actor, ok?",neg

theBeach,"Interesting idea, but that was all.",6/10,ianwarrender,24/2/2000,"Interesting idea and I believe that the book was very good. However the film seemed to rush through important parts, and then slowly shift through some other parts. Boyle is a very different director, but I think that at parts in went over the top with some of his surreal scenes.

Leonardo DiCaprio did another great acting job however I think that it wasn't his style. The other cast around him for me seemed very woody, and not real, apart from Daffy (played by Robert Carlyle) who brought the film a small bit of life.

The plot was sound, it could have done however with some extra parts so that some of the jumps in the story line were not too sudden. The ending was also poor, however the start was faultless, and well portrayed.

The film overall was okay, it had some interesting scenes, like DiCaprio, as a computer character, which added something most films lack. However this film itself lacked depth and never seemed real, until the last scene.

theBeach,What a nice pop video.,7/10,FabF,21/2/2000,"Fantastic music, fantastic images. No real content, though, sadly enough.

Leo's fans will love it, of course, particularly females, as he spends most of its time running around naked. The general theme does sound quite good: a bunch of ostracised people living their lives away from civilisation, simply because ""they can't bare it anymore"". A criticism towards today's society? Sort of reminds me of William Golding's Lord of the Flies, or even Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Always this idea of an Island, a paradise, a false sense of loneliness, of independence.

I must confess I overall liked the movie. I particularly enjoyed that conjunction of sometimes poetic, sometimes violent music and image. Congratulations to Moby, to Underworld, for such gorgeous themes, and to Danny Boyle, for putting it all together, even though sometimes we wish the movie had been more than just a nice pop video.

I have been at some of the places where they shot the movie. The center plot is about Richard making holidays backpacking in Thailand, finding a remote island where a bunch of people are living on a wonderful beach, away from modern society and enjoying life under palm trees and with much marijuana. The story twists when this society breaks on the usual problems of mankind: power, love, weapons, physical injuries, etc.

The movie has wonderful nature shots of the island and the beach, a very good soundtrack (which i hear in my car from time to time), good act and brings the feeling of the story to life. The book is more towards the idea of American (and generally western) fascination for Vietnam and apocalypse now, Richard is talking to a phantom in his head about going to Vietnam, etc.

There was nothing I enjoyed about it--I was too p***ed off about how completely moronic it was to even LOOK at the scenery. Once I saw this movie called ""The Triangle"" and hated it.

Apparently the book is pretty good... sorry to whoever wrote it, but the movie is so bad that I no longer have any respect for you or anyone you know. Leonardo DiCarprio is now my least favorite actor.

In summary, watching this movie made me want to kill myself. I am not a suicidal person, but after realizing that there are people on earth who enjoyed watching ""The Beach"" I decided that life is no longer worth living.

theBeach,"Read the novel, it's a lot better then the film",4/10,freemantle_uk,29/6/2010,"What could have gone wrong with The Beach? It was based on a popular, critically acclaimed novel, starred Leonardo Di Caprio, who was considered one of the world's biggest stars after Romeo + Juliet and Titanic and was directed by Danny Boyle who had won plaudits for Shallow Grave and the excellent Trainspotting. Well, many things, but at least Di Caprio and Boyle were able to bound back with great success.

Richard (Di Caprio) was an American traveller, landing in Bangkok, the starting point for many travellers going to South-East Asia. He goes to Thailand because he wants adventure and tries to avoid the usual tourist route. On his first day a mad Scotsman, Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), kills himself and leaves him a map to a small island with a legendary beach and lagoon. Richard befriends a young French couple, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and the two make their way onto the island. After a dangerous journey the three discover a commune of travellers, including the leader Sal (Tilda Swinton), her boyfriend Bugs (Lars Arentz-Hansen) and Keaty (Paterson Joseph), a Christian and a cricket fanatic. Life on the beach seems perfect, there is work to do but plenty of time to relax and to Richard it was what he wanted, a place away from the usual traveller crowd. But there are threats, the cannabis farmers who control the rest of the island, shark attacks whilst fishing and Richard's secret of giving the map to two surfers, Sammy and Zeph (Jerry Swindall and Peter Youngblood Hills). But Richard got what he wanted: adventure.

The main problem was that The Beach was too disloyal to original novel. There are minor things that were agreeable, like changing Richard's and Sal's appearance, maybe changing Sal from American to British. But most others did not work. One of the main things that affected the film was changing Richard from being English into an American and well the film suffers because of it. Some scenes like when Richard meets the surfers loose their impact, mainly because in the book the surfers pretend to be a stupid cliché and both are actually very smart, but in the film they are both well, a stupid cliché. We don't get to see how Richard's mind ticks, like his obsession with Vietnam war movies, he personal reasons for travelling and his dreams with Daffy. Other elements that ruined the film include cutting the character Jed from the novel, who was an important character, befriending Richard and acts at the beach's protector and an outsider to the community. Even if the character had to be cut his characteristics could have been implanted into someone else like Keaty. The film also skips over other story elements that drive the plot, like the food poisoning and how that led to a conflict between two camps within the community.

Acting wise the film does have some decent performances, like from the French actors Canat and Ledoyen and Swinton (who is normally a good actress). But it was Joseph who was the best of the cast, having excellent comic timing, even if his character was changed. But for Di Caprio this was one of his weakest performances. He was sadly quite wooden in the role and he just shouted a lot. We did not get to truly see why Richard was so excited about the prospect of adventure and it just felt hollowing, going through the motions. The actors who played the surfers were also noteworthy for weak performances.

The novel was very organic in its plotting, feeling real, even at times it did feel a little slow. But in the screenplay and the director the film felt like it wanted to rush through everything, taking away some of the natural nature of the book. A great example of this was how Richard invited Étienne and Françoise on the trips and their basic plans: there was no realism behind it.

There are some positives to the film. Boyle was able to add a little style into the film with some camera and editing tricks, like the camera going back quickly to reveal the waterfall and there are moments of tension and action with the cannabis farmers. Boyle also got the sense of the beach's hypnotic affects, making people forget about the outside word. There are also moments of comedy like when Keaty explains the rules of cricket. Boyle get the sense of what makes some travellers think, wanting to explore, party and partake in the local culture. It shows that Thailand has become very Westernised and that travellers are looking for the next big place before it is discovered and flooded by Westerners. I feel the same, I go on holiday to avoid English-people and I want to experience the local culture. Plus there is a good soundtrack, with the only good song by Moby as the signature track of the film. And there is some excellent cinematography and beautiful scenery throughout the film.

At Di Caprio was able to make Catch Me if You Can and Gangs of New York to kickstart his career after two flops (The Beach and The Man in the Iron Man). Boyle also somehow made friends with Alex Garland, the author of The Beach (which is very surprising) and two were able make 28 Days Later and Sunshine. So The Beach was not all doom and groom.",neg
theBeach,Weed heaven,3/10,knutt,22/7/2007,"My three stars for this movie goes to the Thai actors who actually spoke Thai - and more accurately the SOUTHERN dialect as expected as of where the island would be. I guess there are some ""spoilers"" in here somewhere, so if you truly do want to see the movie (I suggest you waste your money elsewhere), stop reading HERE.

So, what was so bad about this one? If you sit there smoking little cigarettes without tobacco, then this movie is for you. If not - forget about it. Because if this IS what you do, this movie's got it all: Weed for breakfast, weed for lunch and - hey - surprise (limited offer, only today) weed for dinner! The story is about a traveler from (surprise) USA who discovers his paradise on Earth: A secret beach on an island in Thailand - a place where there are (oh, my) an entire society of dope heads having an endless rave party.

I guess this is the story of The Garden of Eden retold in its hippie form, where you can smoke as many reefers as you like as long as you don't tell anyone else.

It is quite embarrassing to sit there watching a movie where they manage to get the culture of a country totally wrong and give you the impression that Thailand is a Mecca for dope heads. Maybe so on SOME islands, but Thailand so just happens to have EXTREMELY strict laws on drugs.

Taking so lightly on murder as they did in this one, and for that matter, drug abuse, is seriously way wrong. You do not make a movie where you get the feeling afterward that ""everyone"" around you smokes joints more or less all the time. Also, the really REALLY distasteful way of dealing with killing a person and then just - poof - forgetting about it afterward. Shame on you, Danny Boyle!",neg
theBeach,Fantasy turned,8/10,tylerschell,21/10/2006,"A part of me wants The Beach to remain squeaky clean. I want the three to arrive at The Beach, fill in the social gaps of the group, and live happily ever after. I want them to end up blissfully ignorant of everything westernized and remain secluded in utopia. The other part wants the film to explore further its darkness and show the full dismay of The Beach and its main characters. I actually wish they would release this film on a choose your own adventure DVD. I could then choose to watch the movie in its Utopian and positive dream scape of The Beach arrival scenes, or deep into its dystopian and dysfunctional night terrors. They should release that.

theBeach,NEEDS to be remade -- could have been a GREAT movie,4/10,bmac8903,31/8/2006,"Ever since I saw the trailers for the Beach, I've loved the concept. The story has so many interesting components: drug culture, a hidden paradise, rural dope farmers with Ak-47s, a beautiful french girl, an exotic country, surviving off the land, etc. I recently got around to reading the book and if you at all like the movie, you'll LOVE the book! I read the book in less than 2 days (it's 400+ pages long). Every time I stopped reading, I couldn't think of anything but what was going to happen next. So, after I finished the book, I watched the movie again.

Ugh. The movie is so much worse than I remember and completely different from the book.

***LOTS OF SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT*** Now, Leo isn't bad as Richard, but his character is supposed to be British!! And after checking IMDb, Ewan McGregor (who was supposed to play Richard) would have made a much better Richard.

In the book, there are a lot references to insanity and Apocalypse Now. Richard going insane in paradise is a great aspect of the story, but it's practically skipped over in the movie! In the book, Richard does a lot commando missions and spends a lot of time in the jungle, stealing weed from the dope farmers and talking to the ghost of Daffy (not booby traps). This is a great part of the book but the movie horribly butchers it. The homages to Apocalypse Now are sooo bad. The movie skips the details and plot build-up only to have Richard eating poisonous slugs and running around the jungle like he's in a video game?! And Banjo-Kazooie at that?! TERRIBLE! Prehaps the biggest offense is the character named Jed (or the lack thereof), who is one of the book's best characters but completely missing in the movie. In the book, Jed is a mysterious loner (Colonel Kurtz?). Richard is assigned to work with Jed and they do all sorts of commando missions, swim into underwater caves, and make the rice run together (not Richard and Sal -- poor excuse for a bad sex scene). Jed is a great character with a lot of good scenes and quotes -- WHY WOULD YOU CUT HIM OUT OF THE MOVIE!? The American surfers who get killed are also extremely messed up. They are not supposed to be retarded stoners, but Harvard kids who pretend to be stupid only to mess with snobby Europeans. Their stay on the nearby island is a huge part of the book and builds up to the climax SMOOTHLY. When they do make it to the island -- they aren't gunned down in the marijuana field. Instead, their fate is much MUCH MUCH more gruesome and theatrical (very Hitchcock like).

In fact, the ending of the movie is soo lame compared to the book. I won't go into great detail, but in the book, the ending features: a marijuana laced feast, discovering the fate of the American surfers, the death of a main character, the dope farmers don't kick everyone off the island, and a sum up of what happened to everyone after leaving the Beach.

In general, the movie is a terrible adaptation. It is made up of a lot of the more boring parts of the story and cuts out some of the best scenes. The plot was butchered by John Hodge and Danny Boyle for seemingly no reason. It really angers me to think that such a good book was so poorly translated onto the screen.

A much better version of The Beach must be made.",neg
theBeach,Paradise lost,4/10,rebeljenn,13/11/2005,"While attempting to be a dark and thoughtful film, The Beach simply struggles to find a voice and to be taken seriously. There are some good ideas about disasters in paradise (or paradise at a cost), but these ideas have similarly been done before. The film makes an effort, but it struggles to capture the characters and overall meaning. The only good thing about the film is the cinematography. If they had put more emphasis on the characters and used the cinematography to capture the characters' feelings more appropriately, then this would have been worth watching. Instead, it just loses itself in paradise and in the pretty cheesy events.

theBeach,"Beautiful, original and... pointless",6/10,eldergod-1,28/3/2005,"""The Beach"" is a movie which left me with mixed emotions. It was really a beautiful and well-made film. the beaches, the sea, the jungle, the kisses- all was beautiful and cleverly shot. On the contrary, when something bad happens, like shark attack, it is really gory and nasty. The contrast was brilliantly made. The actors played very well. I'm not a great fan of Leo Di Caprio, but he proved his talent again. The plot was original and interesting. But after all this strong points of the movie, I wondered - what's the point of ""The Beach"". It is obviously not ""just for fun"" and I really tried to figure its message. But I didn't find any. People go to a secret beach, live happily, than with shark attacks and drug farmers the dream becomes nightmare. Few of them die, they leave the beach. This is the film. A beautiful, well made, original, but... pointless. Still I recommend it and maybe you will find something I didn't.",neg
theBeach,The only good thing about the film is Virginie Ledoyen,2/10,bismarck_1892,7/3/2005,"The only good thing about the film is Virginie Ledoyen. Unfortunately, there is not enough of her in this film to make it better. She has a wonderful on screen presence and charm and I hope she will continue to make English language films. But, good ones.

Her french colleague Guillaume Canet plays his part well and naturally. DiCaprio, on the other hand, tries just a little too hard. Meaning, his character is a bit over cooked, over acted, and just simply over done.

Boyle makes a poor showing as well. A lousy screen play, made from a good book. The story is choppy. Boyles' attempt to blend the film with his style (think video game scene for example) was completely unnecessary. Which, by the way, made DiCparo's character even less believable. In short, its a pretty bad film.

theBeach,A Disaster From Start To Finish,2/10,sddavis63,24/2/2001,"Leonardo DiCaprio successfully sheds his ""Titanic"" image in this account of a young American tourist who stumbles upon an idyllic island paradise while on vacation in Thailand, only to discover that paradise ain't all that it's supposed to be. Unfortunately, the same can be said for this movie. It's terrible in almost every respect.

The premise is hardly unique. For years the idea of discovering paradise only to be disappointed with what you find has been the theme of novels, stage plays, movies. The closest analogy for this movie might be that it's kind of a ""Lord Of The Flies"" with adult characters. But the really surprising thing is that such a well-worked plot could be burdened with such an absolutely incoherent story line, which repeatedly falls into ridiculous and juvenile silliness. And the ending makes no sense at all. Why in the world would the ""dope farmers,"" who have already demonstrated that they are willing to kill to prevent more people from coming to their island, then simply pack the inhabitants of the village up and send them back to civilization? Now there's a good way to keep the island a secret! Certainly one wouldn't expect originality in this kind of story, perhaps, but it should still be interesting! Trust me, it's not!

The movie features some good photography and beautiful scenery - which barely manages to raise it from a 1 to a 2 in my books. Aside from that, ""The Beach"" is a monotonous disaster all the way through. Do not waste your time on it. You will regret your decision.",neg
theBeach,Despicable characters...,3/10,Zanygal,8/2/2001,"What a bunch of selfish hedonists! Most of the characters on the beach just made me want to smack them around the head with an inflatable baseball bat...or a large flounder. Either way they are some of the most greedy, disgusting and selfish characters I have ever come across. Their total obsession with having 'fun' and keeping their petty secret -at all costs really revolted me...and turned me off the movie completely.

theBeach,Intriguing,8/10,solun-1,19/4/2018,"I recommend you see this movie. It was one of those films that I have kept on my watchlist for a long time but never really wanted to give it a try because people said it was not really good. I think if you see this film alone and just try to enjoy it; it will take you on a suspenseful ride where you look forward with tension to what will happen next. I did not get bored. The film is so well done that I didn't get distracted at all, it just kind of flows naturally and you are really attached to the characters. You might feel excitement, anger, fear, sadness. There have been a few places where I thought the characters should have done something else - but that is me, someone would probably have acted the way they did. Overall, this movie touched me though not in a sad way; it just felt really convincing and makes you think about it. Good actors, obviously good crew, interesting setting. Well done and recommended. I didn't read the book so can't elaborate on that.

theBeach,A paradise must exist.,9/10,giggcarter,27/12/2017,"In my late teens early twenties and somewhat with the world at my feet, an open mind, a list for adventure and travel. Very much did the beach inspire me to journey the world. A uplifting and energetic soundtrack score that mixes memories with belief and life. As we get older our innocence falls and we become a norm, Life kinda slows and we become set back and comfortable. The film shows life is for living. The natural beauty of our world is our paradise and the feeling within is our ultimate paradise. If u get the film it's all about living. Leo is fine and has developed into a tour de force actor. Tilda is super.

A film that inspires adventure.

I really can't put my finger on to why this movie was panned by critics. I watched hundreds of films in the last 25 years and ""the beach"" is a stand out. Leonardo DiCaprio is charming as he always, the other actors and actresses are amazing as well. Actually, the whole concept of finding this community of European travelers on a deserted island in Thailand surrounded by drugs farmers was gripping and compelling. I never read the book but I'm sure it's great as well. Friends, don't listen to ignorant reviewers, some of them are just mean and the others are industry workers. Not every reviewer on the internet is legit. Enjoy the beach!

theBeach,An original and stunning film !,8/10,louislandesrobi,13/5/2016,"I really enjoyed this film! The action takes place in Thailand on a hidden island with incredible landscapes. The plot is very original and stunning. However, it's a little too long at the beginning. The love story is typical but stays watchable because it's not overwhelming. The cast is very attractive with Leonardo Di Caprio and the others excellent actors who are absolutely convincing and believable. The music isn't unforgettable but stays listenable and reminds me to The See's Tooth at a sequence. It creates an effect very gripping. There is a real message behind the film about our society: it is better to get a hidden life; or live at the same rhythm as society and accept its choices?

theBeach,The Beach review,9/10,saymaraza,26/3/2016,"I just recently rewatched the beach with Leonardo DiCaprio, and it was great! I have become a very big fan of DiCaprio over the years, and a lot of people seem to think that this film wasn't one of his stronger points. I grant you, it wasn't one of his best movies, but his performance in it is mesmerising as usual. With Danny Boyle directing, we see the more exotic side to Di Caprio with him topless on the beach. It reminded me more of a James Bond style to the film (Casino Royale) with Di Caprio being Bond. DiCaprio gives a very powerful performance as Richard in the film, and shows off his skills as an Actor. The same year as this, Di Caprio was offered the role of Patrick Bateman in 'American Psycho' which after turning down, then went to Christian Bale. Di Caprio took this role on instead. This film I don't think would have given as good of a performance as American Psycho would for Leo, but Leo sure gives his best, as he is very captivating every second he is on screen, with full commitment to the role!

theBeach,Good for a lazy afternoon but don't get too excited,5/10,fernando-guglielmetti,8/12/2014,"Review: The Beach (movie)

In nutshell The Beach is a random Hollywood movie, which could be worthwhile to pass the time if you don't have anything better to do, as my friends and I didn't. The yummy popcorn was far more gripping than the storyline (but don't give up on my review now. there is good stuff at the end!).

And why I got such letdown by it? Manly cause most of the story is I meanshallow and also too easily predictable. I also reckon that the author focused too much on Leonardo (who I think is a good actor), remaining too little space to the other good guys.

However, what I found really really breathtaking was the incredible set. The pristine island in Thailand was a stunning and perfect place for the hippie community, being this by far the best characteristic of the movie, therefore strongly inspiring myself to visit this paradise.

So, you should also have a go and see if you agree with me. It could be as well a good inspiration for those who are fed up with their lifestyles and are craving a bit of adventure! Cheers.",neg
theBeach,For the Adrenaline Junkies...,10/10,Christopher_elia,12/9/2014,"My love for Leonardio Dicaprio made me watch this film. However nothing had prepared me for what i watched. ""The beach"", is one one of the most adventurous films i have seen in a long while. An ideal film to those who feel like they need to escape. To those who feel the urge for adrenaline. To those who feel the need to belong somewhere. Without a doubt Leo gave the best performance of his young carrier in this film and truly managed to amaze me with his acting throughout. This film will excite you, it will terrify you, and most importantly it will connect with you as well as give you a motivation to live. I honestly feel like my life has changed after viewing this film, even 14 years after its release, ans it is certainly not to be missed. The directing was pretty solid throughout and accomplished what it was aiming for. The director could make you cringe, laugh and love whenever he wanted, and the protagonists fooled you by their impeccable performances. Notable performance: Tilda Swinton was magnificent in showing emotion, and compelling drama.

theBeach,We really don't look with the same eyes,4/10,cestleilacherradi,12/3/2014,"Some actors are good in this movie. And some are awful. The french ones! Boy, is it possible to act that badly? Is Virginie Ledoyen in this movie just because she's pretty? Though the story is good! Leonardo DiCaprio is good. But can you really make a movie on your own? No. I loved the black guy who played with him at times. There was a connection. You could believe in that relationship. But never on the one with V. L. There was nothing believable about her play.

I wonder... shouldn't we see more ugly people who can act?

Though Tilda Swindon was very very very good.

But really this individual s**t must be over = a movie is really good when everybody gets together in it.

theBeach,Life is a 'Beach',6/10,Fluke_Skywalker,11/10/2013,"'The Beach' starts off colored by the shallow and self-obsessed millennial angst of Gen X/early Gen Y that was (is?) so rampant at the time, and by the time it's over any interesting observations it makes about human nature or modern society are undermined by the fact that it looks like a J. Crew catalog in motion.

Solid performances and gorgeous locations aside, 'The Beach' is an often grating snapshot of every loathsome characteristic that now sadly defines my generation. I remember liking this so much more back in '00, when I was filled with shallow and self obsessed millennial angst myself.

theBeach,Very intense and gut wrenching at time,9/10,AvidClimber,26/6/2013,"The Beach is about paradise, what we'll do for it and the consequences. Nothing is perfect, everything has a cost.

The good. Intensely dramatic scenes. A modern phantasmagoric mix. Superbly paced scenario with great cohesion and editing. Solid characters, very realistic actions and reactions. Nice score. Superb acting.

The actors. I'll just mention the two best ones: Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Carlyle.

The bad. That video game overlay. It's not necessarily a faux pas, because it's well tailored to the persona and his psychosis, but it just doesn't fit very nicely with the rest of the movie style.

The ugly. Nothing.

The result. A must see. Sensible souls should avoid for the drama, and a very gory scene.",pos
theBeach,It's... different.,7/10,Wuchakk,20/6/2013,"I watched ""The Beach"" shortly after it came out in 2000 and it left me kind of perplexed, although I was fairly entertained and the story kept my interest.

The story involves an American youth, Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), traveling in Thailand who learns of a paradisical beach hidden on an island off the coast many miles away. He ends up hooking up with a French couple and they travel to the island together.

The reason ""The Beach"" leaves people a little puzzled is because it's so many thing. It's an adventure, a drama, a romantic triangle and an art house film with existential commentary. But somehow it all comes together and works as a whole, sort of.

The beach community is somewhat of a modern hippie commune. Even the most equalitarian communities have a leader or leaders. In this case it's Sal (Tilda Swinton). Richard realizes he'll have to maintain her favor in order to remain in the paradise, even if her subtle demands are disrespectful and ultimately authoritarian. Since The Beach community is a paradise, anything that takes away from their sense of bliss must be removed. As they say, out of sight out of mind.

Shot in Thailand, the film runs 2 hours.

FINAL WORD: ""The Beach"" is an unusual film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. There's really nothing else like it. And it's worthy of repeat viewings.

GRADE: B+",pos
theBeach,"Painfully underrated; an entertaining, engrossing movie",9/10,Rosser94,13/3/2012,"I see many negative reviews for ""The Beach"" and I really struggle to identify a justification for such an underrating.

When I watched this film for the first time, I considered it to be an entertaining and original movie that, although retained a sense of solidity throughout, never truly shone; what puzzled me was the fact that I was glued to the screen throughout.

However, upon my second viewing, I realised that this film carries a subtle depth that contributes strongly to its engrossing manner. Aside the strong acting and great script, a deep focus on characterisation ensures that the movie's protagonist and the changes he undergoes are incredibly engaging; in accordance with the fact that DiCaprio takes this lead, we are left with a character study as much as a movie. Furthermore, without giving anything away, the various parallels and paradoxes, both positive and negative, as well as the sense of underlying realism, ensure that, as a viewer, you feel compelled to truly take an interest in the ""The Beach"".

Despite the strength of this film, what prevents it from being a true masterpiece is the fact that the pacing and atmospheric focus of ""The Beach"" is slightly too inconsistent and it can make the experience an overly peculiar one at times.

Overall, it is difficult to explain why ""The Beach"" is such a compelling, intelligent and engrossing movie (especially without adding spoilers), however you just have to give it a go. It is a movie that can be watched multiple times and has a subtle depth to it that many viewers will not spot during the first viewing; I highly recommend you experience ""The Beach"".",pos
theBeach,"Quite the experience, don't be turned away by the low score",10/10,sneakysnacks,20/11/2011,"I went into this movie with rather low expectations, but came out quite pleased. The atmosphere created in it is actually pretty believable, and really demonstrates some of the negatives of tourism, while also showcasing some of the most amazing things about tourism. It also explores a number of other themes such as the impossibility of utopia. I have had a totally changed viewpoint on travelling because of this movie. Also, Leonardo Di Caprio is quite good, no idea what people who say he was bad are talking about. If you have any interest in travel, Thailand, the pursuit of paradise or just appreciate good atmospheres, watch this film. Oh, and the opening scene is one of the greatest opening scenes of any movie ever.

theBeach,More unconvincing acting from De Crapio,3/10,mrbobke,19/11/2011,"This movie was on my 'Movies to Watch' list. It shouldn't have been. My problem was mainly with Di Caprio, but the overall movie was a loser, as well. The guy just doesn't do it for me. He always seems like the same dude, no matter what part he plays. Even in Shutter Island I still saw the same pouty pretty boy.

The movie doesn't make it any easier on pouty boy, either. It progresses slowly, but at the same time you don't feel like you get to know anyone. There was a bit of 'Heart of Darkness' to the whole 'crazy' part when he's out in the woods. But it was just so oversimplified and contrived, and just simply unbelievable. The dude is sitting out in the woods eating bugs with nothing on him, and after a few days starts running around like Tarzan? It was all over for me after that. The images and scenes in this movie have already been forgotten. And its better that way.",neg
theBeach,I don't like Paradise (dvd),7/10,leplatypus,10/7/2011,"This movie illustrates brilliantly the idea that i came with my spiritual reading: while revealed books speak about paradise as ultimate reward, with gold, women, my concern was about the one I love down there and who could be sentenced to hell! How could i be happy to be in Paradise if they weren't?

Here the dilemma may be different but the anguish is the same: Heaven can turn into Hell, and as the movie intelligently points out, where do you go then if you want to leave Paradise?

Another good testimony here is the numbness and delusion of modern life: actually, we experience a lot of virtual pleasure (as reading this web screen now) and we have lost touch with what is real! Thus, we have all inside us this yearning for a simpler life, communicating with people that we can actually touch! The global village is just a mirage because our body is attached to one location at one time.

At last, the movie offers another great truth about ultimate freedom and doing whatever we want. This isn't paradise because it's indeed the pathway to hell, the right journey to madness!

With all those subversive ideas, Boyle delivers a great movie, a modern parable that he explains with his commentary. The Leo we see here is the Leo i don't like: conquering, arrogant, liar, cheater and worse. But it's a intelligent trick to pose him as the hero, all the more he is not more the ""King of the world"". At last, being french, it's funny to see my fellows (Ledoyen, Canet, De Fougerolles) in a international movie!",pos
theBeach,Great Movie (Believe it or Not),9/10,Jharrison-22,9/6/2011,"I'm a Danny Boyle fan. Not the biggest fan in the world, but I certainly enjoy his style. However, I had heard that this movie was a stinker, so I decided to give it a pass for a while. When I did get around to seeing it, I was blown away.

1. The acting. The acting was superb. Robert Carlyle was excellent as Daffy. Both french actors (Virginie Ledoyen and Guilliaume Canet) were solid. DiCaprio was great. One review I read accuses him of playing a ""nobody"" but I assure you that this is exactly why he was so brilliantly cast. He's an American twenty-something on vacation in Thailand. He is unsure of himself and he is capable. He doesn't know what he wants or why he's here. DiCaprio plays this part perfectly, acting both unsure and overconfident. Tilda Swin is perfect as the leader of a small island community.

2. Storytelling. This movie is really hard to place. It starts out as a ""finding oneself"" type film with some thriller elements. It ends up... somewhere I did not expect it to go. THe story follows a windy road full of twists and turns, and takes the viewer to places he had no intention of going. It should also be mentioned that this film is fairly similar to Apocalypse Now (Boyle's Favorite Film). This movie is also funny. I wasn't expecting that either. There are moments (very few, actually) of fun and play in this overall rather dark story.

3. Score, editing, cinematography, etc. When I watch a Danny Boyle film, I am always reminded of the other films he's made, both stylistically and thematically. Despite using different cinematographers, his films invariably have a specific visual style (much more apparent in his later films) with angled camera, and rich blues, yellows and greens. In many ways, this film reminded me a little of Trainspotting crossed with 127 Hours. It's less flashy than one, and more than the other, and deals with some similar elements of trial that are present 127 Hours, as well as an interesting cast of characters, like Trainspotting. Both films have at least one hallucination/insanity moment, but I will not go too far down that road for fear of uncovering spoilers. The score was fine, I felt it fit the film rather well, giving it the flashy wildness of the 2000 without going overboard. Most of the soundtrack has a kind of retro synth feel combined with a more modern beat. Not the best music on the planet, but nothing to lose sleep over.

Anyways, I could go more in depth about specific story elements, plot devices and scene structures, but I won't for brevity's sake. But, to sum up my review: I loved it. At many points during the film I found myself thinking: this is such a good movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews. this is completely worth watching.",pos
theBeach,"Good, but read the book!",6/10,yarnell-797-79215,22/7/2010,"""This is vastly different from the Richard that Alex Garland wrote in the source material. Garland's Richard is a polite, borderline selfless British traveler with dark hair. In other words, he's the polar opposite of Leonardo DiCaprio's self-involved adulterer. This isn't a drawback. Too many people draw novel-to-film comparisons, when the two mediums are far too different to be doing so. The Beach is a brilliant novel, and justifiably a cult classic. The film adaptation is compelling in its own respect.""

As a separate film to the book, the movie was good, great locations, brilliant actors, and decaprio's solid acting. But, the movie didn't express the full toll on Richard (who was British) the extended time on the island did to him.

Your find yourself agreeing with the character, and feel as if your going mad yourself.

The film just didn't grasp that.",pos
theBeach,"Good, but more could have been done with it.",7/10,Geronimo2900,13/5/2010,"The first half an hour of 'The Beach' gave the impression that it was a film about extremes. Whether it's the completely foreign world of horrible hotel rooms and snake blood DiCaprio's 'Richard' finds himself in, or the suicidal madness of Carlyle's 'Daffy', or the pursuit of absolute perfection in the beach itself, all these things seemed to be presenting the film as either highly dramatic or deeply philosophical. With such a set up, I personally hoped for this film to stay with me for a while for one of these reasons. However, neither one seemed to materialise, or at least not strongly. Screenings to background tourists of 'Apocalypse Now' at the beginning of the film resonates with the theme of the madness of solitude, but Richard's madness seems all too sudden to be convincing. Dramatically, whilst the plot moved along at a reasonable pace, the ending seemed weak, with the release of the island people back to their own lives being fairly anti-climactic. Maybe it was some sort of metaphor how paradise will always let you down, but I was fairly underwhelmed.

The acting was strong throughout, but the characters were fairly two dimensional except for the core three, which isn't ideal when the story is focused on a small community and the tensions within it. I also found that the soundtrack ruined parts of it for me. Whilst I love Moby's 'Porcelain' as a song, I felt it completely removed the exotic beauty of the moment they see the beach. I would have much rather had something more anonymous playing. That's fairly trivial, but was quite a poignant let down for me.

Whilst this seems heavily critical, I'm only writing the review in such a manner because I am generally a big fan of Boyle's, and thus rate him highly, so looked for a lot in this film. It is still clever, thought provoking and the cinematography is beautiful. Richard is, on the most part, well crafted and consistent, and moments of this film really did stay with me afterwards.",pos
theBeach,...is best served during the icy cold winter days...,7/10,grenmonkey,10/1/2010,"The Beach (2000) has a bad name of some sort, not all seem to like it and many think it's a poor film based on a great novel. I disagree, I liked it. No, it's not perfect and the glorifying approach towards ""backpackers"" what once might've been the coolest thing ever feels cheesy and awkward a decade later, but the film still has some great things to offer.

The film manages to convey the relaxing though occasionally threatening atmosphere of the life in ""paradise"" quite nicely, Leonardo DiCaprio (Richard) does a good role in the lead, the film looks visually great and has some imaginative tricks in it's sleeve and the soundtrack fits the mood of the film very well.

That's the good, then the bad: the story isn't as engaging as you'd expect or hope - the story doesn't feel consistent and has some misteps along the way and doesn't seem to go anywhere in the end. The film starts out promisingly and constantly hints that something great is waiting around the corner but that never comes true; you feel mostly disappointed in the end. Not every performance from the cast convince either, especially Virginie Ledoyen (Francoise) and Guillaume Canet (Ètienne) were poor.

The Beach is best served during the icy cold winter days when the sun barely rises above the horizon - it takes your mind to somewhere warm and beautiful for a couple of hours, though it's story might not really charm you. 3/4",neg
theBeach,A good dark yet exaggerated look at humanities lack of empathy,7/10,skeecats,22/11/2009,"A good dark yet quite exaggerated look at what happens to people when their quest for rudimentary selfish pleasures exceeds at the expense of one another.

Leonardo DiCaprio(Jack) plays a pleasure seeking tourists who gets whisked away on a journey of fun and adventure and finds an island of like minded pleasure seekers who have escaped the toils of modern day consumerist culture only to witness the very same cancer eating at them ironically leading to their communities demise.

On this journey driven by a quest for euphoric utopia they are made to resemble the fanatic empires of the past , rigidly defending their community in the hope of preserving and maintaining it. Jack buying into it and becomes one of the main defenders of the system.

Jack yet at first being its staunch quite sociopathic and psychopathic defender soon becomes alienated by this community for his weird behavior and soon he becomes becomes instrumental in its demise. Its a story that's got love, betrayal , sex murder and an important answer for this societies illusive quest for Shangrilah(insert your god here eg. money, pleasure,drugs....) that some people are desperately seeking at the terrible cost of human life.",pos
theBeach,"Unique, flawed but fantastic.",8/10,grdontom,27/7/2009,"Danny Boyle has flown from B list director to household name in recent months after the runaway success of his latest movie, Slumdog Millionaire, but a lot of his earlier work received little or no recognition. The Beach is a perfect example of this, but it is interesting to see the development of his directorial skills. The seeds were obviously sown long before they flourished to Oscar winning standards, and the cinematography is glorious.

It is easy to see why IMDb has a low average rating for this movie. It is a little scatterbrain and certain plot points are left unexplained, leaving it feeling a little incoherent. Also, there is one particular sequence to do with the main character Richard, superbly portrayed by a comfortable DiCaprio, is isolated and begins to lose his marbles. This is very odd few minutes, baring very little relevance to the overall plot and it somewhat breaks flow.

These gripes aside, the movie is an extremely interesting watch, for several reasons. Despite having all the hallmarks of a Boyle film, the cinematography is unique. It bares a similarity to Trainspotting, in that the main character is our narrator, but the strange mixture of intrigue, romance and adventure is certainly refreshing. Where the movie really excels however is its exploration of some little explored concepts.

The idea of isolation in paradise, and the selfishness of human kind is explored in detail, with the private colony's leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton) being the personification of this concept. Robert Carlyle makes fleeting appearances as Daffy, a crazed former resident, disgusted by the ""cancerous"" human race. Are there elements of environmentalism in to be picked up on? Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The roots of Boyle's recent genius show sparks of the brilliance to come and the sheer uniqueness on show will be endearing to any regular film watcher. Sure it has its problems but what films don't? With a little patience and trust in the director you may just find yourself enthralled.",pos
theBeach,What if you where on that desert paradise island?,8/10,sya-titia,26/5/2009,"This movie couldn't quite hold my attention all the way. To be honest. But the bad reviews are intriguing. It was actually much better than I expected when I watched it. Somewhere the theme of the movie is revealed: ""nothing is to interrupt the pursuit of pleasure, not even dying."" And this is not a spoiler. This movie will unexpectedly become more philosophical even than intended I think. It has some really really nice edges to it. It spoils our longing for a paradise. That's what it does. But that's not a bad thing necessarily.

What if you where on that desert paradise island? Think about it. Get puzzled along the way and rent this movie. It will not disappoint you! Well maybe a ini little tiny bit. But I still give it an eight for the effort.

theBeach,What a disappointment,2/10,phbois,20/2/2000,"What a disappointment! I was so excited to see ""The beach"" on the big screen after having enjoyed so much Alex Garland's novel. A great story, interesting characters, well everything for a good movie. But the scenario is poor, with no real main line, more a series of shorts. John and Danny were not able to extract the essence of the novel, sad. So much time is wasted on useless scenes. The acting is far from bad but the efforts of DiCaprio, Swinton and LeDoyen are wasted by such a bad ""mise en scène"". Go and buy the book but do not waste 2 hours in front of the screen.

Mistake # two is the biggest: If you would put thirty people on a deserted island all kinds of interesting things would happen. This lot, after spending six years with each other, behaved as if they were the cast of a second rate soap opera. Really nothing interesting happened at all!

theBeach,"I appreciated and enjoyed it, even with its major flaw",8/10,bopdog,12/2/2000,"There is a lot to like here, even though there are some major flaws, too. At first I thought it starred Matt Damon, who is great, but in the lobby of the theater on the way in I saw it starred Leonardo DeWatchimacallit, who I dislike and distrust. So I was prepared to hate ""The Beach,"" but was surprised at how very good it was. I was particularly impressed with Leonardo, who I had previously thought of as nothing more than a giggling trifle. He can act! And he can come off as a actual man, too, not just the foppish object of teeny-bopper desire. Good job, bud!

The first hour is powerful, mysterious, beautiful, and very engaging. The second hour is probably where the detractors were turned off. Admittedly, the conceptual material becomes really corny-- the type of obvious, belabored ideas about hedonism, love, character, etc. that one would expect from a precocious 19 year-old. I imagine that 35 years ago ""The Beach"" would have been a stunner-- and it would have been hailed as a gripping, bold view into the darker parts of the human heart. Now, the moral lessons and conclusions seem naive to the point of silliness. But wait! In spite of that, there is something about this movie that is immensely rewarding and entertaining. A vibe of pure power, and a vibrant life emanate from every scene. I can't explain it beyond that-- this movie has LIFE. And it is technically perfect, too. Visually amazing, well acted, well edited, etc. It's kind of the opposite of the recent movie ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" in which the scenery was rare and imposing (lots of snow on lots of cedars), but it was empty and sterile. As a movie it struck many folks as lifeless and dreary. ""The Beach,"" by contrast, looks like a masterpiece, and feels like a great movie-- even though the story kind of falls apart towards the end. Often times flawed movies piss one off, but this movie won me over and had me appreciating it even as I was seeing the conclusion as amateurishly juvenile. Go figure?

I gave this flick an ""8.""",pos
theBeach,Spoiled brats on vacation,4/10,b-a-h TNT-6,7/3/2002,"What a disappointment. Danny Boyle had recently directed one of my favorite films of the last few years, Trainspotting, and although Leonardo DiCaprio has never been between the actors I liked, I had somewhat high expectations for The Beach. It turned out that DiCaprio's acting is actually the best thing about this clunker.

To say that The Beach didn't have the space to develop its ideas would be wrong. The movie is based on a book by Alex Garland, and while I never read the book, I must say that the concept the movie seems based on could be interesting. The search for a new way of living outside our society and considerations on the impossibility to find the perfect Paradise on Earth are captivating, and as a nature lover I must say that it is really rare that pro-ecology undertones don't appeal me. However, these themes were treated in such a vapid, superficial and often hypocritical way in The Beach that when the movie was over I was not just bored, I was irritated.

I am not blaming the author of the book. In fact, it could be that the novel is a good read. But if the movie is a good adaptation of it, then I am sure I will skip on the book for the rest of my life.

The Beach opens in Bangkok; Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American man, is here on vacation. In the hotel he meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking lunatic who shows him the map to an island where, it seems, it's possible to find the most beautiful place on Earth. Richard doesn't pay much attention to him, but when the next morning he finds that Daffy had killed himself, he steals the map and wonders if this beach really exists. Finally he decides to take a chance and, along with a young French couple, he takes a trip to the fabled island.

To this point, the film is not particularly good, but it is at least interesting. But as soon as the movie gets to the beach, everything starts going downhill and it never stops, reaching the worst with the awful finale.

When the three young tourists get to the beach, they get to know that they are not alone. A small village of young men and women already lives here, and although it seems like a disappointment at first (at least judging from DiCaprio's voice-over), when Richard and the French couple get to know them and their way of living, they begin to be very fascinated. The small village, it is said (more on this later), is self-sufficient and they can live without any contact with the outside. The problem is, if anything happens, they are on their own.

The movie puts in some romance between the French girl, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and Richard, and some time is spent on the consequent grief of Françoise's boyfriend. The romance however, fails to generate any sparks, and the focus on Françoise's boyfriend anger is shifted off so abruptly he practically disappears from the movie. However, as uninteresting as the romance is, it is not nearly as bad as most of the rest.

First of all, there is not one likable character. Most of them are either paper-thin, irritating, spoiled, and usually all things together. There is much talk about how these young people are self-sufficient, and yet we see that they are not: they hardly do anything all day. Richard himself has to go on the outside world to buy goods for the island community, and most of these goods are the typical unnecessary comforts many tourists look for when going on vacation. The people on the island play video games and buy beer; it's never shown where they put their trash. In many scenes the movie looks like a Club Med commercial, and it is a pity since the problems of a small society truly living on its own never get the possibility of being delved into.

During the course of the movie, two characters are attacked by a shark. One dies in a brief time, the other is left dying in the woods because, it seems, the island community doesn't want people on the outside to know about them. Deus ex machina anyone? How does ""bringing a man to the hospital"" immediately connect to ""revealing where the community is""? And when the members of the community go to play volleyball while their friend is left dying, one would at least expect that it is a starting point to show how they will be unable to cope with their own sense of guilt. It never happens.

In a completely different scene, Richard suddenly loses his mind without apparent motivation, and one has to wonder what it is all about. And after some nonsense that leads to the killing of four tourists who reached the island, he snaps perfectly awake again. Absurd.

And when Richard finally gets back to 'normal' society, we see him thinking about the island with nostalgia. That's right. Puh-lease.

Stylistically, this movie is a huge step back from Trainspotting for Boyle. The music is barely tolerable, the cinematography relies on the beautiful scenery but puts in some inappropriately silly scenes, such as Richard transforming into a video game hero while walking in the forest. The performances, apart from DiCaprio's (pretty good, but not very good) range from average to bad. But what's most disappointing is the treatment of the subject matter. Trainspotting had ideas, characters and story. The Beach has ideas that never get developed, irritating characters, and a story that barely stays together.

theBeach,Not as bad as all that,6/10,smatysia,1/6/2001,"Not as bad as all that. Deliberately evocative of ""Apocalypse Now"". I am presuming that that is an homage. Beautifully photographed scenery, including Virginie Ledoyen. She is major eye candy. Leonardo DiCaprio, as irritating as I find him, is actually quite a good actor. Anyone who doesn't believe that should rent ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". He did a creditable job here, and you have to give him credit for taking this role, a rather unlikeable character, right after ""Titanic"". I would have found the lifestyle on the island awfully appealing in my 20's, a life of leisure, unlimited dope to smoke, etc. That wasn't enough for Richard (DiCaprio) however, and he falls into the category of adrenaline junkie. One thing, though, with all of those twentysomethings living on that island, it's hard to believe there were no children. I thought the direction was quite good throughout with the exception of the video game sequence. Dumb. I suppose it was meant to appeal to a demographic group which doesn't include me. Overall, I enjoyed watching the film, but will not be buying the DVD. Grade: C+

theBeach,Oh dear.,6/10,Seth-13,26/10/2000,"Read ""The Beach"" by Alex Garland. Marvel at the strong, consistent plotline; at the well-defined and evolving characters. Fixate on the mastery with which Garland handles and twists Richard's descent into madness around the reader.

See that the movie comes from the same director/producer/screenwriter team as the superb 'Trainspotting', and get very excited.

Actually see the movie. Be very, very, very disappointed.

Realise that screenwriter John Hodge has not even read ""The Beach"" by Alex Garland. See that the only thing that the film retains from the book is the names of the characters and, of course, The Beach. Realise that while one or two of the events from the book remain, the film is so different, that there was no point.

theBeach,A stunning visual movie experience that was unfortunately brought down by the weak story.,6/10,Anonymous_Maxine,30/8/2000,"Although The Beach was an interesting and well acted film, it ended up contradicting what it was trying to say at the beginning. The scenery in incredible with the beautiful white sand beach that is completely isolated from the modern world, and the transition between the two when Richard and Sal traveled back for supplies was startling and very well presented.

The unlikely premise of the film, a young traveling boy searching for the meaning of his life runs into a seemingly insane man in a third world motel room who decides to give him the map to paradise and then kill himself is a little hard to believe, but Robert Carlyle was wonderful as that man, and he easily stole every one of the few scenes he was in. After that, it was a fascinating adventure watching Richard and his two friends journey in search of that paradise. However, the unlikely events that led to the formation of that friendship is another thing that took away from the story.

After the shark attack (not the laughable one where Richard actually wrestled with and killed the shark, taking it home for dinner, but the one where people were hurt and killed), the concept of paradise was a lot more realistic. It is true that a utopian society is not possible without some element of misery, and the man who was badly injured by the shark represented that misery. You cannot have absolute happiness without absolute misery. To put it in the classy and sophisticated words of Beavis and Butt-Head, ""If nothing sucked, and like, everything was cool all the time, then it's like, how would you know it was cool?""

Richard's descent into temporary madness was a very creative and well done part of the film, in my opinion. The video game cinematography was not only original but it also cleverly represented his innocence and inexperience in the world. The acting in the film was very good, I think it should be noted that Leonardo DiCaprio delivered a brilliant and amazingly convincing performance, despite his terrible acting in Titanic. Besides that, the settings and camera work were excellent as well. Unfortunately, I just think that the story was contradictory and not thought out very well. The film stressed the importance of close friends and loyalty, but it seemed like it ended up emphasizing the importance of e-mail and iMac computers. Or maybe that was just a bit of clumsy and awkward product placement, maybe they were having problems getting people to bank-roll the film. Are they trying to say that a paradise such as the one in the film, if ever found, is impossible to keep? As a whole, I think that the film is trying to portray the destructive power of greed, but the message is so clouded with other distractive elements that it ends up looking and sounding confused and contradictory.",neg
theBeach,Over-dressed and boring,3/10,Matt-162,8/8/2000,"The beach is a beautiful movie. You could almost watch it with the sound off, much in the vein of the ""Endless Summer"" surfing movies...because outside of scenery, it's hard for me to see anything else to waste time on.

The movie starts out interestingly enough. Robert Carlyle gives such an energetic performance in his small roll it almost suggests of great things to come. This expectation lasts up until our heroes find their island paradise, and then the entire thing down-shifts into neutral. As reviewers have stated, few of the characters in this movie are likeable; they are pretentious, naive and treacherous. Their loyalties lie to themselves and their pleasures alone. Dicaprio gives an uninspired performance as perhaps the most despicable of the lot...his selfishness and childish behavior destroying any sympathy or empathy when his Kurtz-like descent into madness arrives. By the time the movie reaches its dramatic peak, I was too bored with the entire thing to care.

I picked this up because of Danny Boyle's involvement. He does a nice job with the movie, but throws in way too many bells and whistles in attempt to make a bad story interesting. I've never read the book, but if it's anything like this adaption...I'll never understand how it sold like it did. This is a complete yawner. It presents a obvious and tired examination of that certain clique-ish side of human nature that pervades the island camp. The conclusion is anti-climactic and predictable. The characters are not developed at all; it's like watching an episode of ""The Real World"". The acting (with the exception of Carlyle and Tilda Swinton) is weak. As other reviewers have stated, another actor in DiCaprio's place may have improved this movie significantly, as he is very unconvincing to say the least.

The soundtrack is good for the most part. The scenery is beautiful....and there are enough beautiful people to fill a dozen bad sit-coms. Too bad there's dialogue. It would have been better off without it.",neg

Danny Boyle has done a good job with the directing and the d.o.p. was really successful. However, I believe the novel version had more philosophical strength to it, and the film lacked the novel's interesting philosophy. As it's cinema, I guess it's an all right adaptation. However, one must tell Danny Boyle to cut down the amount of first-person narratives, since in The Shallow Grave it was innovative, in Trainspotting it was well-integrated into the narrative, yet now, in The Beach, it's plain boring at times.

theBeach,Why does paradise always have to destroy man?,6/10,Dkish,12/2/2000,"The Beach By Dean Kish

When Hollywood is faced with idea or image of paradise, why does it always become so bloody? `The Beach' marks the return of Leonardo DiCaprio to the silver screen after his frozen corpse disappeared off the edge of the Titanic. DiCaprio joins with `Trainspotting' director Danny Boyle as a twenty something year old, Richard, exploring the allure of the Far East. He takes a room in a seedy motel where he comes in contact with a psychotic drug-user Daffy (played by Robert Carlyle). Daffy shares a joint with DiCaprio and tells him of a paradise that no man should mistake is there. He tells an urban legend about a mythical beach incased in cliffs and cut off from the world. DiCaprio shrugs it off as a wild story until the next morning where he finds a map tacked to his door. `The Beach' could have been a beautiful romance set against an epic adventure as Leo's character teams up with a young French couple to find the mythical `Beach'. But when we are introduced to what makes the mythical island tick the movie takes a strange `Lord of the Flies' direction as the island's world will do what ever it takes to preserve their paradise.

The scenery and imagery director Boyle conveys brings you in and captivates your attention. The beginning's scope and deliverance reminded me a lot of `The Blue Lagoon' and `Castaway'. Both of these films had great potential but ran out of story before reaching fruition. `The Beach' instead mixes the potential seen in `The Blue Lagoon' with an acid trip from `Lord of the Flies'. The end result is heavily flawed hero that you either hate or you are extremely confused about. This is no way to paint an adventure hero. As a critic I will pity the masses hoping for another epic romance from DiCaprio. So exactly where does the `Beach' fit into Leo's acting career. I would have to say it proves undeniably the melding and molding his career is taking. The first half of the film we have the Hollywood star but as the film enters its second half we see the heavily flawed characters he treasured earlier in his career. The films I am referring to are `Total Eclipse' and `Basketball Diaries'. `The Beach' does deliver a lot of allure which made me want to see a really good island adventure movie. Which did make me wonder did this film ever want to really explore that avenue. Coupled with that allure, I found myself feeling more for the heroine Françoise (played by beautiful French newcomer Virginie Ledoyen) then for Leo's Richard. Why does paradise always have to destroy man? Well it destroyed the Beach. (3.5 of 5) So says the Soothsayer.",neg
theBeach,"Regard on realism,romanticism and amusement",3/10,pschuur15,15/3/2000,"My opinion of the film is not very positive. It is not realistic at all,it starts very romantically and later turns into a contradiction of a utopian world. It is like an insight-experience of a child. (Aha-Erlebnis) Therefore it will be more successful for younger people. The humor is not very original, and the horror-effects are very simple.(My heart wasn't beating 2 or 3 times ,so it DID work!) It feels like a summary of effects, more then an emotional-logical web of events. The best aspect, I think, is the array of cinematografical (?) solutions, use of the film-hardware, camera-angles. The quality of images ( stills ) are very high. So it is more the ""How"" i.s.o. the ""What"" of cinema. For me it has very little to do with real-life-experiences. I get very curious about ""Train spotting"" (Next time I will try writing Dutch, this is too hard )

theBeach,Bad choice for Leo,3/10,mercury-26,1/3/2000,"Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant work in Titanic (though not his best) and the unexpected explosion of popularity that ensued, opened wide the floodgates of his career. He now earns a Tom Cruise-sized paycheck for any old project he chooses to attach himself to. We all hoped he would choose his projects wisely (from what I have heard about American Psycho, he was wise to turn it down).

If hindsight were 20/20, one could argue for his passing on The Beach as well, the film adaptation of wonder boy Alex Garland's novel, which I have not read. The source material notwithstanding, this is a grim tale that goes everywhere you don't expect. Usually this would be a good thing, but this project meanders endlessly as we take a trip through the slowly fragmenting mind of Richard (Leo), an adventurous twentysomething just looking for a little excitement in his life.

Richard's journey begins in Thailand, where he stays in the world's worst motel and ends up living next to Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking psychotic raving about a hidden beach on an island paradise. Because Richard doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life and he's real bored, he buys the story, takes Daffy's map, and sets out to find the island. He even finds two more suckers willing to be stupid with him, the lovely Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet), French lovers traveling together (but of course, it's Leo and poor Etienne never stands a chance).

When they finally find the island, the film becomes a bit humorous (intentionally, I think) as we meet its inhabitants, basically a bohemian mini-culture living in complete seclusion from the world, calling themselves Parallel Universe. The group's founder, chairperson, and den mother, Sal (Tilda Swinton), is obsessively protective of their culture. The fun ends like it always does, and the film gets increasingly trippy, ugly, and violent: In a word, `disturbing.'

In the end we're supposed to realize that paradise is something to be earned, not claimed: You can run from the world, but eventually it will find you. One humorous scene features the members of the group, one by one, giving Richard their long lists of items needed from civilization. He and Sal (who naturally can't resist Leo's charms either) are to make a trip back into Thailand (for extra rice or something). It occurs to you, even as you're watching this scene, that the crew and passengers of the U.S.S. Minnow were so much cooler and more resourceful than these losers!

Beach, of course, was made by the writing/directing team who brought us the far superior Trainspotting, John Hodge and Danny Boyle. Their creative stamp is most definitely visible here and they do create some memorable visual imagery. This is due in large part to the masterful photography by the distinguished, versatile Darius Khondji, the man responsible for Se7en, Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, and Evita. I can't recommend The Beach, but I'd still run out and see the next Boyle/Hodge collaboration. Come to think of it, I've seen every one of them since 1994's Shallow Grave.

theBeach,Liked it for the most part,8/10,Boyo-2,24/2/2000,"I had read the novel of ""The Beach"" and didn't feel that the screen version was that much of a hack job, save for certain questionable writing decisions. Leonardo is very good for the most part but he does make a false move or two. I enjoyed the last moment of the movie the most and will see it again to relive that. Two hours after it was over, I still felt like I saw a movie, which doesn't happen as often as one would hope.

theBeach,An unrewarding watch,1/10,lamiaaos,22/8/2018,"This felt like nothing but an immensely poorly executed trial at portraying the events and ideas in the book from which it was adapted into a film. In fact, despite the guiding narration throughout the film, it ends up being just a pile of hysterically nonsensical scenes and storylines that are more often than not leading the film into the middle of nowhere and ending abruptly without any explanations, with the point it wanted to make seemingly distant and faraway. All in all, this film undoubtedly proved itself unworthy of even a one-time watch.

theBeach,This movie left me with a feeling of uncertainty,6/10,pamoore82,5/10/2013,"I really enjoyed this film but I couldn't help but think was Di Caprio really there on official police business or was the whole scenario in his mind. His mental problems were most likely due to his marijuana problem and his hatred of the French.

Ben Kingsley on the other hand was superb as that stoned lesbian mainland rapist. The make-up team and everyone involved with making Kingsley so believable in what can only be described as his greatest role to date deserve as much credit as the man himself.

I hope that they fully consider making a sequel as I wonder what will become of Di Caprio after he gets that injection that kills him. The story has another movie in it for sure and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way due to the massive amount of support that my blog ha received in the last few years, which has became almost violent and bordering on revolution.

Viva le France baby!",neg
theBeach,"Now get some sleep, I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.",7/10,lastliberal,14/12/2008,"Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) brings Leonardo DiCaprio back after Titanic in a story that will make his fans cheer, but leave the rest of us feeling that we were cheated.

Long on philosophy, but very short on excitement, this is a movie about Camelot. You remember, don't you, ""...there's simply not a more congenial spot for happily-ever-aftering than here in Camelot."" Or, on the beach, for that matter.

Except there is a price to pay for even this, the most idyllic of spots. Even here, the nastiness of death and dying must not intrude. It's how we manage to avoid the ugliness of hundreds of thousands of dead in Iraq, and our reputation sullied by those who condone torture. We mustn't let anything interfere with our pursuit of big screen TVs our gas-guzzling SUVs.

With her beautiful face, Virginie Ledoyen (The Valet, 8 Women) was the bright spot in this movie. Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) made a perfect white witch who ran the paradise and was willing to preserve it at all costs - even her humanity.

But, it only exists in your dreams, my friend.",pos
theBeach,A highly underrated movie,4/10,scottjaco,23/3/2008,"I am really shocked at the negative reviews this film has gotten over the years. I believe this movie initially got a bad rap primarily because it was the next big budget DiCaprio flick following ""Titanic"" People like me who had seen earlier DiCaprio films like ""The Basketball Diaries"" were pleased to see him return to a similar style role while the mass public (mostly women) were merely looking for a Titanic sequel.

The Beach is a coming of age classic about one man's journey through Thailand. His pursuit of paradise leads him to an island where he discovers the perfect utopian society.

The story moves along at a quick pace and is interwoven with some great internal monologues. The cinematography is amazing. The music soundtrack alone is reason enough to watch this movie.

""The Beach"" depicts the ultimate fantasy of finding a private island paradise while enjoying the hedonistic lifestyle. The movie eventually takes a darker turn as it shows the consequences of their behavior, which asks the question ""is paradise real, or is it all in your mind?"" Not an original sentiment but the movie remains quite entertaining throughout.",neg
theBeach,What's in a film?,8/10,All_about_Bangkok,17/1/2007,"I really enjoyed this work. I have always enjoyed Danny Boyle's films. With the exception of ' A life less ordinary' he has been consistently good. He was exceptional with '28 Days Later'. Those who read the Alex Garland book will find obvious and disheartening story changes. However, I've yet to come across a movie that does not often deviate from the book, an exception being 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The performances are delivered with acceptability, the scenery is incredible, and the story, well, close you mind for a few minutes and it is believable. Leonardo gave a consistent performance, I found it better than the performances he receives critical recognition for these (Blood Diamond, Departed). So despite the negative reviews, I urge you to see this film for yourself and make up your own mind. There are far less competent film you can waste your time with.

theBeach,Crazy Paradise,7/10,WiltonR-M,9/3/2006,"The Beach, although now a few years old, still continues to intrigue me! It's cast a fantastic bunch of people and the concept very creative.

The first time i saw this film, it lit a fire in my belly, i wanted to jet off to Thailand and find a secluded beach of my own..but the fear of the weed farmers scares me.

The surroundings of this film have such an ecstasy feel about them, a very private and unknown island, in Thailand where a bunch of travelers come together in their secret society to live out their lives in total bliss without the annoyance of real world politics.

The character of Sal somewhat annoys me, she may be the leader, she treats this place as her dictatorship, the secrecy of the Island is so important, that i can understand, but her fowl plot to destroy Richards relationship with his love interest disturbs me.

The computer game scene isn't necessary, this is where i cringed! the blood and tears are not too over the top, and it is an important part of the story, it gives the idea of a life in secret paradise has its penalty.

Although the story is complete fantasy even though something like this may possibly exist, it confirms the beauty of Thailand and takes you on a journey that you've always dreamed of experiencing but would never go through with.

The Beach is an entertainer, a DVD watcher, i saw it at cinemas and it did not live up to its preview hype! but a good one to have in your home collection!",pos
theBeach,The Dream Vacation,10/10,CoMacK,12/8/2003,"When I first saw ""The Beach"" it was like I was watching my dream vacation. Danny Boyles' attention to detail brings out emotion in a way that makes his characters' experiences more personal to the viewer. This detail is most notable in his immaculate character devopement of ""Richard"" (Leonardo DiCaprio,) which is an art that seems to be lost in film today. It also is apparent in Richards' affair with Virginie Ledoyens' character ""Francoise. The way their relationship unfolds was so real yet so romantically ""Hollywood"" at the same time, like a dream. I must say, the casting of Virginie Ledoyen made the movie much more exotic and mysterious as she is such a beautiful and talented female actress that has been virtually untouched my American cinema. After seeing ""The Beach MULTIPLE times it made me realize that the best trips are the ones where no matter how much went wrong, all you think about when remembering them is how much went so right. This is a great movie to escape with... it also helps that Virginie Ledoyen is a goddess! ...please excuse the typos...

theBeach,The Ultimate Paradise is the Ultimate Fascist Hell.,3/10,Pingo-2,22/7/2003,"Leonardo DiCaprio is Richard, a back-packer that finds The Beach; ""The Ultimate Paradise"". The Beach is an urban myth, spread among the tourists in Thailand. Richard, of course, goes to The Beach.

Where the film starts off in a nice pace, building up a nice story, and even with a very nice monologue in the beginning, it soon becomes a tale about fascism, and how good it is. Even DiCaprio's character is in on this, and we never really see him turn his back against these ideas. He claims, in the middle of the movie, that The Beach isn't ruled by ism's or religions, no ideals, no ideas. But nevertheless, the inhabitants on The Beach play by fascist rules and think like nazis.

This isn't too obvious for the General Moviegoer, and hence, this movie is kind of dangerous, since it doesn't develope these ideas in the ""correct way"". Though, maybe the writer IS a nazi, but then, why the hell did this film get distribution?

The Beach is a movie that sucks. Big time. The violence is well made, but mean. The action is good, but uneven. The production is technically stunning, but slow, and in a very weird pace. And the editing, well, the editing is very weird. In the end we have a ""computer game scene"" to show us that DiCaprio is going insane. Why did they think this was a good idea in the first place?

The resolution of the movie is very sloppy made, or, as said before, the production team really likes the idea of fascism and that humans are not worth enough if you want to protect An Idea.

Don't see The Beach. Don't give The Fascists your money. They don't deserve it.

3 out of 10 - only because of very nice technologically produced film.",neg
theBeach,One Of The Best,10/10,DamnCritics,1/10/2002,"This is probably my all time favorite movie. The beginning is well done, I love the narration. If you want to watch a movie that lets you leave reality behind and take a journey that could only happen in a dream, THE BEACH does that perfectly. I can watch this movie once every two weeks easily and not get sick of it. Towards the end gets a little trippy and for some reason doesn't fit but I was able to overlook it and still enjoy the movie. A definite must see.

theBeach,disappointing,4/10,AlexTLion,10/9/2002,"It´s always the same: You read a book, look forward to the screen adaption and you get disappointed to a certain degree. That´s ok, usually... but this one really p***es me off. If you have such a good artwork as ""The Beach"" by Alex Garland, then stick to it or leave it. The director didn´t stick to it and unfortunately didn´t leave it either. So the result is crap, every character has been changed in a way you get a different story at all. What has remained, is the names - not much. Just one thing to point out: The director leaves out Jed, one of the most important characters of Garland´s book and tries to disperse this person over a bunch of others. Those ""others"" again, then of course can´t stick to their original characters/plots and so on. The storyline ends in an ultimate mess, inescapable. I gave this movie 3 out of 10, but only because it might be bearable if you haven´t read the book. If you did, avoid the movie on all accounts.

Nonetheless, its not a total waste, just a wasted opportunity.

theBeach,Two pints of snake blood please!,9/10,epsilon3,21/3/2002,"I really enjoyed The Beach. After Titanic, I was sceptical of DiCaprio movies, but here he's clearly trying to show he's a serious actor and he does a great job.

Considering himself to be superior in some way to the usual backpacking crowd, Richard (DiCaprio) is looking for something different that'll take him away from the tourists and give him a 'real' experience. He's given a map of an Island from a deranged man called Daffy (brilliantly played by Robert Carlyle) and in an intense conversation, is told of a beach on the Island that is completely hidden and offers paradise.

The next day he finds Daffy dead in his hotel room - he's committed suicide. Richard joins up with two French backpackers - Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and sets out to find the Island...

The acting in the movie is great throughout with DiCaprio showing he's not just a pretty face. It's shot beautifully - this is one of the best films to show off your new DVD player as the vibrant scenery is breathtaking. The soundtrack fits perfectly and gives it the feeling of a modern movie - the ambient sounding music fits with the post rave tourist culture depicted in the film.

Without going into too much plot detail, things end up not being what they seem and Richard finds out a lot about himself, the way the world works and the frailty of the human condition when people are under stress. The ending is pessimistic as it tells us that there is no paradise - no promised land. Paradise is our normal lives at home with friends and family, with a job and a mundane life. Perhaps this is a truism - the grass is always greener right? I'm yet to decide.

The bad things about the movie were few but noticeable. It can be a little confusing at times and could have done with more explanation of certain happenings. Viewing the cut scenes on the DVD helps and it's a shame they weren't included in the film as they helped. For example there's a scene were Richard is acting out the role of a computer game character. Although you see him playing computer games earlier in the movie, it would have been nice to have this part of his personality emphasized more so that the later scene had greater continuity. The director's commentary is highly enjoyable though - one of the best I've seen.

Overall - a great movie that I'd recommend if you like your films with brains. A flawed classic.",pos
theBeach,"I love Drama, action, but my favorite.......adventure.",10/10,TrumanB22,4/3/2002,"The Beach was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It brings you into a different world.

The movie really shows you how the power of lust and desire can be very dangerous. I really liked how the charachters can be compared to the actors in Apocalypse Now. This movie is a must see. I recommen it to everyone. If you have a wild imagination check it out. - Kevin

I had heard that some people were not keen on this film but i cant see why. Leonardo de Caprio, who is not my favourite actor by a long way, is superb as a tourist who hears while travelling in Thailand of a paradise island where there are beautifull beaches and enough weed to last a life time. He sets out to find the Island but not before he makes hi bigest mistake which is to draw a map and give it to another set of tourists. The story is superb as is the acting and there are moments which leave you with your heart in your mouth. Far, Far better than i was expecting and a joy to watch! 9 out of 10.

theBeach,"Forget the snotty reviews, it's good!",9/10,mezaco,20/12/2001,"Well, I feel like a freak of nature but I really like this film. Despite overwhelmingly bad reviews from most, this film just takes me away to another place and I really did enjoy it. Some people just really need to lighten up.

This film brought out a deep sense of longing in me about my travels and about that search for the ultimate paradise. I found the young people in the backpacker colony on the Beach to actually very similar in looks and attitude to many young backpackers abroad. I also found the sharp contrasts between the Beach and the town on the mainland to be very well done and very true about young westerners in Thailand.

The Beach was different, it was exotic. The film didn't end neatly, and that brings up all sorts of ideas about whether or not such a utopia could exist without human greed destroying it. Tilda Swinton did a superb job as Sal, the colony's leader. And Leo Di Caprio was good too as a cocky young American guy looking for a good time but getting in over his head. By the end of the movie, when he's back in the West looking back at that secret place, it was really sad. The constrasts were such so well done...

This movie has a stupid plot, that could be written down in 2 lines and even considering this, the plot has black holes. Poorly played by Di Caprio - several times he yells for no reason -, some passages pretend to be ""crazy"" and ""unusual"" and this pretension makes it even more stupid. It takes more than shooting absurd scenes to be ""crazy"" and ""unusual"". And the final idea of: ""no place is perfect, pure friendship in a pure place is not possible, the American Way of Life with big cities and computers is better"" is really disgusting. I rated this movie with a ""2"" and the only reason why I didn't rate it with a ""1"" is that the movie isn't THAT boring, just stupid. My God, I only hope celluloid is biodegradable...

theBeach,Shallow Adaptation Of An Excellent Novel,3/10,Otis Lou Bohr,26/6/2001,"Alex Garland's novel, ""The Beach"", was one of those rare books I absolutely could not put down until I'd finished it. I walked across busy streets reading it. It had me hooked.

Now, I didn't expect that the movie adaptation could live up to that standard, but I really did expect something better than this. Leonardo DiCaprio didn't strike me as an appropriate choice for Richard, but the prospect of Robert Carlyle as Daffy gave me hope--how could he not be perfect in that role?

This movie showed me how.

I suppose there's no point in further unfavourable comparisons to the book. Considered on their own, the movie's characters are ciphers, as opposed to travesties; considered on its own, the movie's plot is thin and bland, as opposed to laughably distorted; and considered on their own, the movie's themes and subtexts don't exist.

Scenery's pretty enough, I guess.",neg

The Beach is absolutely lovely and the musical score in the film is good too. I have to say the film is just as good as the book but better. I give The Beach a 10/10. Great film!

theBeach,I give this top adventure 10/10. A definite 'must see',10/10,kspunky1,6/4/2001,"I give this excellent film 10/10 because its exciting, exhilarating and enjoyable from start to finish. In a lot of films, you can tell what is about to happen next. But The Beach is very unpredictable all the way through. This adrenaline-drenched movie is full of twists and turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Richard, a young back-packer desperately searching for an escape from the stress and strain of life. He embarks on an adventure to find the ideal paradise far away where no one has ever ventured. Somewhere only very few know of........Will he succeed? Is there such a place? However, he discovers some things are blessings from Hell............

DiCaprio shows off his great talent (and body!!!) exceptionally well in this film. His believable acting makes you even more into' the movie. No one could suit the part better.

The film is set in the superb country of Thailand, the main location a beautiful island off the coastline. This is Hollywood's idea of an ideal paradise, and stated in travel brochures as one of the few places on earth to be described as 'paradise'. The wonderful locations in The Beach lets your imagination run wild with the possibility of being there. The strange thing is that it's real. This is why the film influences people to follow the footsteps of Richard, and travel around the world not only to Thailand, but to search for their own paradise.

The Beach also has a great sound track, including the best-selling single of 2000, Pure Shores, by All Saints.

This is a great adaptation of Alex Garland's best-selling novel. It is certainly one of the best films I've seen and the best movie of 2000. I recommend you seeing it. Thanks for reading my review!",pos

In a lot of films you can usually guess what will probably happen next, which could be boring. In The Beach, anything could happen from start to finish, and it is full of unexpected twists and turns which keep you interested & 'on the edge of your seat' all the way through. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Richard as the leading actor, a backpacker desperately searching for an escape from the frustrating, stressing hustle and bustle of the city, trying to find a place free from trouble, his own idealistic paradise. Will he succeed? And is there really such a place free from worries?......... Dicaprio shows off his great talent once more in this film and no-one could suit this part better. It is set in Thailand, the main location on a beautiful island off the coastline. This wonderful place is a perfect setting for the film and lets the imagination run wild in the possibility of being in paradise. The strange thing is, it is real. This is why The Beach influences many people to travel across the world to experience not only Thailand, but other places, to suit their own 'ideal paradise'. Another reason to watch it is that The Beach also has many top tunes on its soundtrack, including the best-selling single of 2000, 'Pure Shores' by All Saints.",pos
theBeach,One of the most under-appreciated films of the year 2000...,9/10,sundevil-pictures,7/2/2001,"In the spirit of Taoism and savage human transcendentalism comes one of the most under-appreciated films of the year 2000.

The Beach is a visceral, elegant, and visually perfect adaptation of the critically acclaimed Alex Garland novel. Filmed on location in Thailand, The Beach places the final piece in Garland's nearly completed jigsaw: eye candy.

The flawless settings of Thai surf and sand are undoubtedly one of the world's few treasures, and the vivid colors and sheer majesty of its pure paradise are amazingly captured by the filmmakers. Moreover, the beach in question is quite possibly one of the greatest settings ever used in a film. I still get chills just thinking about that tropic jewel of crystalline waterhow each tiny wave softly spills over white, powdery sand, all nestled underneath sundrenched palms and moss-covered rock. Still, as a fair juxtaposition, the film also takes a concentrated look at the misery of urbanity, offering up clever images of mechanization, population, and capitalization. Great work by the crew, especially Darius Khonji, whose style you may recall from, and will see in future, David Fincher movies.

It is at this point that The Beach marks its true power as a notable event in modern cinema. The movie, under the brilliant direction of Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), allows the audience to navigate between the vision of utopian paradise and the automated social lockbox in which most of us are destined to exist.

As such, a true Taoist journey for personal freedom couples notions of anti-materialism at the core of this story. However, the picture also focuses on ruthless idealism, youthful curiosity, man's tragic quest for the unattainable, the moral sacrifice allotted to a hedonistic lifestyle, and man versus nature.

If you enjoyed Fight Club, Lord of the Flies, Heart of Darkness, or Apocalypse Now, then watch this film tonight! It is an impressive blend of thrills, comedy, and adventure...seasoned with a discreet and gradual event that will catch you off-guard. I personally recommend the Special Edition DVD, as it is another treat delivered by Fox Home Video: aesthetic in design, bustling with deleted scenes, commentary, and other special features. 9/10",pos
theBeach,A treat to the senses,10/10,dub227,23/11/2000,"I felt that this treat was wonderful. I went into this film feeling optimistic and came out wonderfully pleased. I felt that it appealed to all of the audiences senses. Also I thought Leo gave a remarkable performance. I had this feeling when I left that I have never felt when leaving a movie. I feel that its a very under rated film.

theBeach,Joy for the eyes,10/10,*Lilith*,14/11/2000,"The Beach is a great movie. Colorful, funny, serious. I have watched it 4 times and every time I convince myself that it is perfect. Showing a paradise and at the same time telling us that there is no such thing as a paradise, that we can't find ourselves running away from people, being alone. Showing that madness is just one step away from sane. And much more. Actually the only thing I want to tell you is ""Watch it! Don't miss it!"" Besides Mr. Di Caprio showed us again that he's not only the teen idol and the sweet boy but one very very talented guy. A guy that one day is going to become a great actor.

theBeach,THE WORST FILM EVER,1/10,Emperor Palpatine,2/10/2000,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. It's so... bad. Leonardo DiCaprio only contributes his face (like in all his films except Titanic). It's so funny to see how he tries to act without success that you will laugh. Trust me , this film is a waste of time and money, I'm sure that you will have something better to do. The only good thing is the score of Angelo Badalamenti.

Excellent cinematography and soundtrack and excellent acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tilda Swinton in particular. The DVD is one of the best I've seen with scenes that should have been kept in the movie - it would have made the film even more complete and more satisfying.

theBeach,A disappointing version of Garland's novel,1/10,forbc,1/8/2000,"To be honest, I haven't read the novel, I'm going on a friend's opinion of it. We both saw the movie and neither of us liked it. It starts out okay, but quickly turns into a scary ride through some weirdo's mind -- and it's not a very convincing ride at that. The worst about this movie is that they wrecked the island where they did the filming. I found this out after I watched it or I would have boycotted it altogether. That's my two bits.

theBeach,I don't think so.,1/10,alice liddell,22/3/2000,"The IMDb guidelines ask users, quite rightly, to refrain from gratuitously nasty comments. I have to admit that, mildly speaking, I did not enjoy THE BEACH. Suffice to say, the film's eagerness to adopt the DELIVERANCE/APOCALYPSE NOW/TAXI DRIVER mantle was compromised by its anti-septic, travel-brochure prettiness; that its megastar centrality resulted in play acting psychosis, rather than a disturbing embodiment (compare with Martin Sheen in APOCALYPSE NOW, for example); and that the film's fetishisation of youth's golden surface dazzles its professed aim of exploring its sinister undercurrents. Boyle-MacDonald-Hodge once made TRAINSPOTTING; I hope they may do so again.

theBeach,Complete crap,1/10,dazhd,3/3/2000,"this movie is an unbelievable crap!

the major problem of the story is that it shows how weak and stupid people can have problems. there is no great idea in that.

the greatest finding is the happy end of Leo sitting at iMac with a relatively smart face.

miserable...

if you want something on the 'loosing virginity' problem- watch Arizona Dream; on crazy+drugs+love=paradise, watch 'Wild at Heart', or, at least, its remake 'Natural Born Killers'.

theBeach,The Pursuit of Pleasure,7/10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,20/10/2009,"I haven't read the novel, and I do not know how this compares to it. This starts the success story that is the partnership of Boyle and Garland. With those directing and writing, respectively, marvelous things happen. This isn't the best(so far, of what I've seen, that's 28 Days Later..., though I haven't watched Sunshine), but it's a nice start. While this never completely grabs you the way it seems like it meant to, it is still an interesting enough piece. Leonardo stars as Richard, a youth who hears about a mythical place and goes to seek it out. The script reveals a degree of naiveté, and there are a couple of obvious holes in the concept. If you do stick with it, this comments convincingly on human nature. Some of the voice-overs are a tad pretentious. This has great editing and cinematography. The acting tends to be pretty solid, and, in order from most to least, Swinton, Carlyle and DiCaprio do impeccable work. Pacing is good. The plot develops throughout, though it doesn't all hold up to close scrutiny. This holds strong language, brief nudity, a bit of sexuality, disturbing content and instances of graphic violence. I recommend this to fans of those involved, and of this type of film. 7/10",pos
theBeach,"""The Beach"" Is Nothing Short of Sensational!",10/10,zardoz-13,20/3/2008,"""The Beach,"" an exotic, symbol-laden saga about the elusive quest for paradise, qualifies as Leonardo DiCaprio's first serious movie since the controversial ""Basketball Diaries."" The talented ""Trainspotting"" trio of director Danny Boyle, scenarist John Hodge, and producer Andrew MacDonald have surpassed themselves again with another marvelously staged, provocatively plotted, and opulently produced film. Based on English author Alex Garland's bestseller, this lofty romantic thriller pays homage to ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""The Mosquito Coast,"" and ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" in its abrasive yarn about three, adventure seeking, twentysomethings that gate crash a secret society on a forbidden island in Thailand where a fabled beach unblemished by civilization shimmers in the sunlight.

""The Beach"" begins sluggishly with our protagonist, Richard (Leonard DiCaprio) restlessly prowling Bangkok, a glitzy decadent tourist trap, before he checks into a shabby but suitable bug-infested hotel. Richard yearns for something dangerous, something to test the bounds of reality as he knows it and attain a state of nirvana. Essentially, ""The Beach"" concerns a young man's rites of passage, an end of innocence and illusions, and a descent into the chaos of maturity. At his seedy hotel, where everybody uses a communal bathroom, Richard emerges from the shower, naked except for a towel athwart his waist, and discovers to his embarrassment that he cannot unlock his door. An alluring French babe, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen of ""A Single Girl""), spots him and help him with his door. She blinds him with a smile as her boyfriend Etienne (French heartthrob Guillaume Canet), joins her. Later, a lonely Richard lies awake in bed at night while his French neighbors bang away in the room next door.

Enter Robert Carlyle as Daffy. He energizes ""The Beach"" as Richard's demented, suicidal lodger from the other side who has fled the island paradise. Daffy provides the necessary exposition, or background information, that sets up the story. While they smoke a joint, Daffy rhapsodizes about the island. Later, before he slashes his wrists and dies, Daffy leaves Richard a map to this mythical place. Richard persuades Francoise, with Etienne, of course, to accompany him on his trip to this topical Shangri-La. Eventually, they arrive on the coast, brave the shark-infested waters around the island, and find themselves standing at the edge of a sprawling field of marihuana.

Their bliss is ephemeral. Richard spots an adorable tree monkey and then realizes the cute little simian serves as a guard dog. Suddenly, a grim-looking bunch of ganja growers armed with AK-47 assault rifles are scouring the fields for intruders. Director Danny Boyle keeps you guessing throughout ""The Beach,"" and this quirky scene exemplifies his bizarre sense of irony. Boyle alternates the good with the bad, so you never see what is coming until it occurs. As the farmers comb the fields, our heroes grovel in horror. Just as they have reached the end of the rainbow, a small monkey stands between them and their pot of gold! The image of a monkey as their nemesis enhances the humor of this scene, too.

After our heroes evade the farmers, they stumble onto a hidden sanctuary of an ideology-free commune, ""a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts,"" where everybody lives in apparent harmony. This lost tribe of twentysomethings has erected a bamboo society not entirely unlike the one that the castaways created in ""Gilligan's Island."" Some couples are straight, while other are gay. Boyle glosses over most of the commune members. He fleshes out some characters, like the cook who is obsessed with cleanliness, but he restricts them to the background unless they exert a major role in a scene. Anyway, they grow their own crops; marihuana included, and survive on fish caught from the lagoon. The shortage of feminine hygiene products and batteries for the Game Boys are virtually the only reason that these mod squatters dispatch trading emissaries to the mainland. Basically, they grow enough dope not only to keep themselves blitzed but also to sell to pay for their needs.

An uneasy truce exists between these lotus eaters and the pot farmers. The farmers let the hippies live on the other side of the island as long as nobody joins them. They fear that hordes of tourists would bring the law down on them. In one scene, they appeal to the sympathy of the commune with the story that their marihuana crop enables them to provide financially for their own families. Clearly, Richard and company have shattered the calm. While she doesn't warm to them immediately, Sal (Oscar winner Tilda Swinton), the leader of this make-shift society, welcomes them. The late, lamented Daffyshe explainshelped found their colony, but he suffered from depression and went AWOL. While our heroes assure Sal that they have the only existing map, Richard refuses to mention the copy that he entrusted to another group of stoners. Later, Richard's secret comes back to haunt him.

The first part of ""The Beach"" bristles with adventure, but the second half is more downbeat and depressing. Paradise may not be all it is cracked up to be. Richard's stoner friends becomes his worst nightmare as they paddle to the island and run afoul of the pot farmers. A shark attack plunges the commune into despair until they banish the survivor, who refuses to check into a hospital on the mainland. Everybody else tires of his whining and wants only to catch up on their suntans, casual sex, and volleyball without hearing him cry in agony.

Altogether, ""The Beach"" is not mindless juvenile pabulum, but an ambitious, serious-minded epic that exposes the dark side of paradise. Those who enjoyed ""Shallow Grave: and ""Trainspotting"" will find that ""The Beach"" addressed the same themes that Boyle and his collaborators have dealt with before in different settings. Nothing predictable stagnates the storyline, and the main characters are more than horny, one-dimensional pawns.",pos
theBeach,Please watch this movie if you have a sense of adventure.,10/10,tigerthekid,15/7/2007,"For some reason, this movie has a low rating. I guess it's not for those people who rate movies based on acting, plot, etc. Granted this movie isn't the highest in all of those categories but it is an amazing movie. It truly captures the sense of adventure and what it's all about. If you haven't seen this movie, please watch it. You won't regret it. ""So Never refuse an invitation. Never resist the unfamiliar. Never fail to be polite. And never outstay your welcome. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience. And if it hurts... it's probably worth it.""

I completely disagree and it is my favorite movie ever. The idea behind it is unusual and different from the argument of loads of other movies. The cast is brilliant, the scenario is too beautiful and i keep thinking about ""I still believe in Paradise, but now I know its not some place you can look for, its not where you go, but how you feel for a moment in your life, and if you find that moment it lasts forever!""..don't understand how people can not quote this movie as one of the greatest movies ever. I may say i read the book after and it was very disappointing. The movie has so much adrenalin.

theBeach,Something Deep And Meaningful In This Master Piece,10/10,the-lonewolf,14/1/2007,"There is so much I can say about this film. The first time I watched it when I was 11 I thought it was a mediocre film, worth the watch but wasn't anything too great.

I then hadn't watched it for about 5 years or so, I saw it in a shop and decided to buy it (fan of Leonardo Dicaprio).

To my surprise, I saw a quality about this film which is why it ranks in at my third favourite film of all time, even though it is so unbearably underrated.

It shows how total paradise can even be turned upside down. It has a lot of quotes that can be used in every day life to spice it up. If you take detail to everything that is said and shown you will find an art within it.

-SPOILER- For example, when Richard is telling the story of his defeat over the shark, when he screams ""NO! I WILL NOT DIE TODAY"" you get an overpowered surge as part of nature to survive.

-SPOILERS END HERE- A magnificent film. Truly original and fresh.",pos

theBeach,Paradise,10/10,zacharyadamchristianhumm,2/12/2006,"My name is Richard. So what else do you need to know? Stuff about my family, or where I'm from? None of that matters. Not once you cross the ocean and cut yourself loose, looking for something more beautiful, something more exciting and yes, I admit, something more dangerous. So after eighteen hours in the back of an airplane, three dumb movies, two plastic meals, six beers and absolutely no sleep, I finally touch down; in Bangkok. Trust me, it's paradise. This is where the hungry come to feed. From mine it's a generation that circles the globe and searches for something we haven't tried before. So never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never fail to be polite and never outstay the welcome. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience. And if it hurts, you know what?

theBeach,A Gem,10/10,surferzero,30/11/2006,"The Beach is one of my favorite movies of all time - definitely in my Top 10 with Lawrence of Arabia, the Usual Suspects, and Fight Club. It combines the talents of a great director, a great writer, and a great actor. I would describe The Beach as a modern day Lord of the Flies.

It was advertised as a love story to appeal to the post-Titanic Leo fan base of teenage girls. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a movie about the pursuit of 'paradise' in contrast to the supposed advancement of human society. It is often violent, trippy and disturbing, just as it is pretty, funny, and exciting.

Don't miss this highly underrated movie!

theBeach,"Or ""The Showcase""?",6/10,j-thompson4-1,31/8/2006,"'The Beach' is an adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel. The film is terrific to look at, and has some genuinely suspenseful moments, but ends up being a glossy showcase for Leonardo DiCaprio.

Now, don't get me wrong - Leo is actually very good as the film's central protagonist, a hyper-cocky and brash Yankee tourist who discovers 'Paradise', only to ruin it. (But does he? And was it paradise to begin with?) Let's just say, he's along way from the box-office B.S. that was 'Titanic' (note for those who've been following my reviews: I am NOT touching that film - even I wouldn't stoop so low as to give time to that rubbish)

However, the problem is that it's all about Leo. The rest of the cast fades to the background - and that includes Tilda Swinton, a brilliant performer who tries hard in the underdeveloped role of the island's icy leader. And Robert Carlyle, whose appearance is reduced to a mere cameo. They are there to make Leo angry, make Leo laugh, make Leo horny, make Leo afraid, etc, etc

And, after a while ... well, one wonders whether it's worth it. Especially when Leo's character goes bonkers. It's very hard to feel pity for such a naive cretin (though one wonders whether they are supposed to). And it's hard not to laugh when Leo does Marlon Brando a la 'Apocalypse Now' (the horror, the horror!)

With its insights about tourism, consumerism and democracy, 'The Beach' is a cut above much 'blockbuster' Hollywood fare. But only just. Leo might be a competent performer, but an overemphasis upon the young actor means the film is more indulgent than insightful.",neg
theBeach,Excellent...,10/10,josephredmon,25/4/2006,"The Beach is one of the most visceral movies I have ever seen. It touches an innate and deep sense of something personal inside of all of us. The sense and perception of paradise lost. The end of the movie reminds you of that continuous thought in the back of your mind, I will never be younger, was that as good as it gets? Not to mention the rest of the movie is an oasis of the mind. Empathize with the characters, imagine yourself there with them. Smoke some gr$$n if you have to, but watch out, this movie is very intense. At least I believe so.

Other movies that I would recommend for the open-minded individual would be as follows:

1) Zardoz 2) I *heart* Huckabees 3) Requiem For A Dream 4) Hackers

*Warning* Zardoz is for the very open-minded. *wink *wink lol",pos

theBeach,"engaging, if ultimately incoherent",6/10,eht5y,3/4/2006,"mild spoiler possibilities below . . .

Like a lot of others who have commented, I initially stayed away from 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews and the nonsensical casting of Leonardo DiCaprio, who seemed then (and now) to be a relatively poor choice to play the lead of Richard (apparently, Danny Boyle originally promised the role to Ewan MacGregor but was persuaded by the money-people to renege the offer and cast Leo, hot off the massive success of 'Titanic'--a slight which damaged their long-standing working relationship and led MacGregor to refuse the lead in Boyle's '28 Days Later,' which ended up going to Cillian Murphy). But I caught 'The Beach' on cable TV, and, while it is ultimately sort of a mess, I was riveted by the direction and the appealing scenario of a small group of neo-hippie travelers trying to form a Utopian community on a hidden Thai beach.

What makes the film so engrossing is Boyle's trademark style, combining stunning visuals, a cast of typically striking and attractive actors, and the innovative use of sound-tracking with irresistibly quirky and hip pop music.

The scenario: Richard is backpacking alone across Asia, partying in the various idyllic hot-spots with like-minded young people, when he encounters the aptly-named Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who describes to Richard a rumored a perfect, 'hidden beach' off the coast of Thailand where a group of 'beautiful people' live in a perpetual state of bliss, playing on the beach and living off fruit, fish, and copious amounts of potent free-range cannabis. The unstable Daffy checks out of the party hotel by carving up his own wrists, but leaves behind a map to the hidden beach, which Richard discovers. Richard decides to go out in search of the beach, and takes along a young French couple he befriends along the way.

Eventually the trio discovers the fabled beach, hidden in a cove on a government-controlled island and known to exist only by the people who live there and a corrupt group of Thai dope-farmers, who tolerate the presence of the Utopian community so long as they keep it secret and do not invite any new residents. The community is governed by its founders, principally Sal (Tilda Swinton), a regal, quasi-aristocratic hippie goddess. Indeed, it seems like the most important requirement in qualifying for membership in the community is being lean, hip, beautiful, and European (Richard is the only American). The group accepts the new arrivals, on the condition that they will not leave and that no one knows where they are or how to find them. Life seems perfect: they live off the land, sleep in a Swiss Family Robinson-ish compound, and re-stock themselves occasionally with worldly amenities (tampons, batteries for CD-players and hand-held video games, soap and shampoo, etc.) with clandestine trips to the mainland where Sal sells big bags of dope to a hotelier who keeps the island secret in exchange for a cheap source of grass to sell to the tackier late-adolescent tourists.

All goes well for a while, until, predictably, 'trouble in paradise' emerges due to the typical jealousies and conflicts that are bound to happen in a scenario with a limited number of options for love and sexual companionship. Furthermore, Richard's position is imperiled by the fact that, before coming to the beach, he foolishly left a copy of the map with a pair of happy-go-lucky American stoners who had befriended him.

Then a tragic event forces Richard and his naive friends to face the fact that, Utopian free-love idealism aside, Sal and her co-horts will act ruthlessly and callously to protect the sanctity of their island paradise. It's a typical 'Lord of the Flies' sort of scenario, not particularly believable or persuasive.

The film was rightly judged as a failure, and the onus rests on two major factors: the casting of DiCaprio, and the collapse of the screenplay into incoherence at the mid-point.

Leo has finally started to mature into a leading-man quality actor, but he was too thin and boyish when 'The Beach' was made to be believable as the maverick Richard. Many have bemoaned the decision to make Richard (an Englishman in the source novel) American, and it's safe to conclude that this decision was a cynical effort to appeal to US audiences by giving them a lead they can identify with more directly, played by a popular US actor. DiCaprio is a great actor, but it's hard to buy scrawny Leo as the principle object of female desire when he's surrounded by a cadre of buffed up Euro-studs.

MacGregor would have made a much better Richard, undoubtedly, but even that wouldn't have saved the film, which careens off a self-indulgent neurotic cliff when the Richard character 'cracks up' in the film's final third. The narrative momentum grinds to a halt and never really recovers, and the conflict resolves itself with a disappointingly anti-climactic confrontation.

Not a great film by any means, but it's gorgeous to look at, the actors are appealing (even Leo, despite being miscast, is engaging and relatively fun to watch), and, most of all, it's fun to fantasize about what it might be like to stumble into a world where the days consist of nothing more than frolicking on the beach, feasting on the bounty of the sea and the fat of the land, balling with the beautiful people, and staying high.",neg
theBeach,A thought-provoking film,7/10,asylumseeker,2/4/2006,"Anyone who has backpacked to various parts of the world and trawled through youth hostels will appreciate some of the accurate observations in this film. It is basically about a backpacker who thinks he has found something different, but quickly discovers how insular and distorted the community he finds himself in is. I think this film makes a great point about how destructive inward-looking groups can be. Leonardo di Caprio's acting is a bit forced and over the top at times, and some things happen in the film which beggar belief, but overall it's a thoughtful account of the need for 'something more' in the lives of lots of young people, and how that 'something more' may not be travel, but a sense of community.

theBeach,prolific,10/10,eliash-1,17/2/2006,"I put a 7 down so people would think I wasn't a blatant fan boy of this movie. But it really deserves a 10.

This is an amazing movie because its purpose it so convey a story of adventure, prolific times in ones life, paradise found, mystery and again the thrill of pursuing beauty and all that life love and friendship has to offer.

This movie is a 10 because it does just that. In the best way. The performances are nothing short of solid. The casting is solid. And the scenery is ...well you get the point.

Songs like 8 ball by Underworld are perfect matches for the movie and the soundtrack is great. The only thing that I don't like about the movie is how tings go so terribly terribly wrong at the end. But hey, c'est la vie. Thats how life works and the message at the end about how paradise is all around us and cant just be sought out and found is a powerful and joyful lesson to learn at the end of the movie. I'm not a huge movie buff but I truly love this movie. I recommend it to anyone.",pos
theBeach,A very good movie under many points of view,9/10,netdoor,23/1/2006,"This movie is a complex movie that joins action and philosophy.

It makes you think about the consequences of a strict group of people leaving alone in their own context, and how the reality around can be dangerous. Also the danger can be inside the same group of people. Finally , that also inside an open-minded group of people some rules are necessary ... and that you can't be a real open-minded if the violence is part of your personality...

It renders very well that type of craziness where a person can fall into when alone and not accepted by the community.

Images are very beautiful, this movie is not boring, Di Caprio acts very good.

Its a very recommended movie to see.",pos

Within the first few seconds of the movie a guy asks Leo to drink snake blood! Everything is so exotic and out of this world! It's a real adventure. A treasure hunt for something beyond the norm. A front seat ride to paradise, no seat belts included! It's crazy pack full of emotion laughter sorrow drama and of course, tropical waters clear enough to see that this movie is an A++++ film! It's as playful as it is serious in the true quest for man to find peace in a world of anger. Whats the final message the movie attempts to get across? Well I wont spoil it here, but I definitely think it rings true and is very enlightening to those who have enough judgment to recognize the moral of the story. Go rent it and find out for yourself!!

theBeach,"Good film, but disappoints in the end",5/10,silenthotel,11/8/2005,"The locations were incredible and this lifts the movie to at least 3 extra points. The story though froze in deep boredom once they actually reached the camp. Leo and the other actors were terrific and the direction was very good, but the story was terrible. I didn't like the book either. I think the main reason is the center piece - the compound of people. It could have really popped with characters we've never seen before - instead of utopia, it was a gripe session. More should have been made on the goals of the group and destructive forces surrounding it. Overall, great film for location, poor film for story. Recommended if you haven't read 'Lord of the Flies.'

theBeach,The purpose of this film...,10/10,hottievegaschica517,25/7/2005,"If you listen to what is really going on through out the movie- i.e. the secrecy of the island, Christo's fate, Sal's breakdown- shows how humanity is nothing more than the flaws we either overcome or succumb to. Great study of human nature. The whole thing starts out as Leonardo DiCaprio searches for adventure, traveling from country to country, no real way of knowing how he supports himself financially (never really mentioned outright in the movie), but seeing the things he does for entertainment makes one wonder if he may have a gambling problem, or if he is really just that bored. This film definitely takes his character on the ride he was asking for, but the ending was not exactly what he had been expecting as an outcome. And a little added bonus: finding that memories are nice, but the lifestyle must be let go.

theBeach,low expectations were wrong,8/10,ehaugee,12/4/2005,"I thought this was going to be a sappy Leo DiCaprio love story--at least that's what the trailer lead me to believe. There was of course a love story on the side--but what movie nowadays doesn't have one? Instead I found it an intriguing, suspenseful, and entertaining journey into the mind of a man struggling to stay sane amid conflicting and sometime disturbing realities.

Like other Danny Boyle movies, namely Trainspotting and 28 Days Later, he does a masterful job of blending perceived truth with fiction. Highly recommended, but you will enjoy it more if you don't get your expectations up!

theBeach,superb!,6/10,otatom,7/4/2005,"I never went to see 'The Beach' or even bothered to rent it. The first time i saw it it was on television and i expected it to be just 'ok'. However 'The Beach' proved to be an intensely exciting film and was completely different from what i had expected and had been led to believe. The second time i saw it i found it even better than before. Many other reviews say that it was an insult to the original novel which i haven't read, so i wouldn't be able to judge that. People have said that the film is dumbed down and even a movie aimed at teenagers, i disagree with this, just because it doesn't seem to be a 'deep' movie and hasn't been marketed in this way doesn't mean that it is for morons, it has a lot of meanings and if you can't see them then it is a problem with you, not the movie. The acting is brilliant and the soundtrack is equally good. I don't understand how some people hate this film but enjoy other films like 'Meet the Fockers' which i think is 100% trash! This film is perhaps one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen, and anyone who hasn't seen it should do.

Thankyou for reading. Otatom has left the building.",pos
theBeach,"either love it, or hate it.",9/10,kevin_parks,19/1/2005,"I loved it. And anyone that dreams of far away realistic adventures would love it as well. This movie is clearly aimed at an age range of 16-30. Excellent music, brilliant story, and The Beach itself make this movie superb. Although the acting isn't much in this movie, I don't think it had to be. I'm not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I can't see this picture without him being the lead actor. Same as Titanic really. This movie can be very trippy, and to some rather dull if they don't like the modern day sense it has. In summary, it's about a traveler in Thailand who has a need for something more. He doesn't want to do what every other tourist does. He finds out about an island which is said to be a myth. He meets two other travelers and they make their way to this island where they are greeted with an absolute paradise. The imagery alone makes this movie amazing, but the story within the imagery could not have been told better. A must see for anyone who dreams of spontaneous adventure.

theBeach,Great!,10/10,derekewing45,26/12/2004,"I was Surprised to see Leo in this film because i know how much he likes to stick to the more classical, older type of movies, but when i sat down and watched this i was already on the edge of my seat in the first 20 minutes. I also fell in the love with the beach,one of my favorite parts is when the finally discover the beach and when Leo starts to lose his mind. The film has certain moments of comedy,suspense,Romance And Adventure.There was one thing I got really mad about though, When He slept with Sal And it made me mad. Great acting, Great Director, Great Writers! I LOVED IT! I give It A 8 out of 10. I really recommend it

theBeach,"Highly underrated, one of the best films of 2000",9/10,OriginalMovieBuff21,9/10/2004,"The Beach starring one of my favorite actors, Leonardo DiCaprio, is about 3 friends who plan a mission trip to go to a paradise island but as they get there they are not alone and things don't turn out as what they seem. I thought the movie was great and getting a 5.8 on IMDb is highly underrated for this movie. The acting and the dialouge was magnificent for this story. Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Carlyle, and Tilda Swinton are superb. The scene where Leonardo is left out by all his friends on the island and he starts becoming bizarre is the best part of the whole film. One of the best films of 2000 to my eyes

theBeach,A great escape,10/10,comack21,31/5/2004,"The Beach is my favourite movie of all time. I say half because I know that people expect me to love a picture with greater cinematic presence and half because it is the one movie that I watch to truly escape from my reality. Richard is the one character that has the chance to do what i have always wanted to do, get lost in the world, and find himself somewhere he never expected. Add to that the beautiful romance between him and Virginie, and you have the perfect story. I love to watch this movie for the great attention to detail by Danny Boyle in the picturesque settings matched with the perfect score. I love this movie in a way that is only fitting to me and I can understand that others may not feel the same way. It's just one of those movie that really hit me in a special way, can you dig it?

theBeach,This movie is nothing short of incredible,10/10,nhaugland,5/8/2006,"I don't know who writes these comments but, this movie was amazing. It shows that even paradise has its flaws. The writing was incredible and The Beach is one of my favorite movies. For the people who say that there is no solid plot it is because they were either not paying attention or they just lack brain power. The cinematography in this movie was unlike anything i have ever seen. Instead of shooting on a set the director found an actual beach in Thailand that is the definition of paradise This movie covered more than one genre throughout the film, like action, drama and comedy. In fact the movie I believe is so good that i am planning a trip to Thailand to see the beach for myself and feel the paradise for real.

theBeach,The most underrated movie of modern time? maybe.,10/10,lyndon_hamer,9/7/2006,"Not many of my friends have seen this film and disliked it. I had read the book ""the Beach"" by Alex garland previously and felt that an adaptation to film would be a great idea. the taste for adventure this film leaves is great and the way it portrays morality is brilliant. bringing home to a different part of the world makes most people feel ""comfortable"" and this film is about taking your chances and risking the unknown. the same reason that intellectual people smoke cigarettes and drink- the choice of not what is always best for you, but what will further you as a human being.

10/10 must see film.

theBeach,The Beach is CLASSIC,10/10,RubyJTuesday,9/4/2005,"This is my favourite movie ever. Seeing that it contained Leo DiCaprio put me off watching it for a while, but to all the people who feel like that, you're missing out! He acts well in this one and he's not Leo, he's Richard. If you begin to watch the film and dislike it, stick with it. The film doesn't really get going for a few minutes. Even if you hate the entire film- unlikely- simply seeing that beautiful Thai island is enough, and the water. It is a really good film, that might not seem particularly deep at first but is really good to watch. The 'Richard's-going-mad-cartoon/video-game' sequence is quite mad, and reverts into Leo rather than Richard again, but it's only a short scene. I love Étienne and I feel really sorry for him!! It's so unfair, and Françoise is so unfaithful!! Also, in response to the person who said a community of 20-year-olds with no kids is unlikely- did you see the scene where Sal and Richard are doing the 'shopping trip' back to the mainland, and are laden with everyone's requests, not least a very large pack of Durex? I love the Beach and I would recommend at least one viewing to everyone. if you hate it after that, fair enough; but give it a chance, regardless of Leo diCaprio.",pos
theBeach,Even more boring than beaches usually,2/10,VisionThing,9/2/2004,"This is one of the least interesting films I have never seen. The plot is astonishingly uninspired: a half-witted attempt to modernize childrens' adventure stories for today's teenagers, with a hasty twist pilfer from the Lord of the Flies and the most cumbersomely laid out love triangle in movie history. All characters in the movie are not only one-dimensional, but that dimension consists solely of being an utterly unlikable monkey. And pray tell, what possible purpose the stale narrator's voice is supposed serve?

I would say that the first half of the movie was majestetically boring, although that leaves me no means of describing the second half, and my only positive thought considering this picture was ""thank God I never saw this at the movies"". But hey, that's only because my image of paradise does not consist of pot, beach and Leonardo DiCaprio acting out his second least ambitious role, so obviously I am not this film's target audience. 2/10

theBeach,Absolutely Awful,1/10,vamp88,16/10/2002,"OK I thought the only rating of 1 I would ever give would be to Hollywood High, but this movie almost matches it's awfulness. At least Hollywood High knew it was just an excuse to show some nudity (it was however mistaken in thinking it was a comedy). I digress. The point being that The Beach had no idea what it wanted to be. Is it a love story, and adventure, a psychological drama, a drama... who knows. Every time it seemed like it had finally made up it's mind the story line would change and ramble incoherently in another direction. I was speechless after watching it. I demand 2 hours of my life back, ok I know I can't get it but how about an apology for wasting my time (and my $ back if it isn't too much trouble). The only thing worth seeing in this movie is the beautiful scenery, but you can get that on the travel chanel for free.

theBeach,A better Leonardo DiCaprio flick,1/10,Illusia,31/12/2000,"I liked this movie. Not quite what he's done in the past. Much better than the majority of his films, in which he has basically played himself. (Except in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. That was a phenominal performance from Leo.) It was different because it was not what I expected. I waited about a year before watching it, and I was impressed with what I saw. Even if you're not a huge Leo fan, you will like this movie.

theBeach,A must-see for DiCaprio fans and an enjoyable no-brainer for all others.,6/10,=G=,28/7/2000,"This DiCaprio tour-de-force focuses on the misadventures of a rebellious young tourist in Thailand. The superficial saga takes the charismatic DiCaprio to a tropical island paradise and a commune of young hedonists. The film would have us believe his experiences are an exercise in self discovery. However, the thin and disjointed plot doesn't manage to conjure up anything sufficiently profound and we're left with a string of fabrications and a feeling that our hero would have been better off staying home and playing video games.

theBeach,The Beach,8/10,jboothmillard,24/6/2005,"From director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) this is a great adventure thriller. Based on the bestselling novel by Alex Garland, the story basically involves backpacker Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio, Boyle's first choice was Ewan McGregor) seeks adventure in Thailand, and he eventually finds it with drug-crazed Daffy (Robert Carlyle). He tells him of a secret tropical beach, and after killing himself leaves him a map, that Richard copies for some guys he met. He then rounds up two friends, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend Etienne (Guillaume Canet). They travel by boat for half the journey and swim the rest, after landing on the island, they escape some troops who own the near marijuana field, jump off high rock to water, and meet Keaty (Paterson Joseph). The island's leader Sal (The Chronicles of Narnia's Tilda Swinton) allows them to stay, as long as they do not go back and tell others, and after settling in and being accepted, they become very accustomed to the paradise (who wouldn't). Richard also gets closer to both Françoise and Sal behind boyfriends' backs, and even survives a shark attack. The paradise starts to crumble though, after more people start to come, and they also die from shark attack, this is when Richard rebels and hides from everyone, in his madness/depression, he even sees himself talking to dead Daffy. The paradise ends when after finding out about more people coming to the island, the troops force them off the island, and all try to go back to some sort of normal life, but they all have their memories of the good times on the island. Also starring Lars Arentz Hansen as Bugs and Daniel York as Hustler. The adventure is a lot of fun, DiCaprio is very good, most characters have their own lovable qualities, the big visual moments, e.g. surreal, are fantastic, the cinematography of the tropical beach is magnificent, and the soundtrack is fantastic, including All Saints' ""Pure Shores"" and Moby's ""Porcelain"". Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Robert Carlyle was number 17 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Tilda Swinton was number 44 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Very good!",pos
theBeach,Pretty good movie. Deserves a better rating here.,7/10,Boba_Fett1138,24/3/2006,"Ignore the low rating here on IMDb. This movie is some decent and pretty looking entertainment. It's a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's a movie made without any potential and in the long run it's a pretty good and entertaining enough movie.

It's very simple to say why this movie 'flopped'. Reason for this was Leonardo DiCaprio. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no Leo hater, that's not my point. My point is, you have to consider the fact that this movie was released in 2000, 3 years after his role in ""Titanic"". Most of the male audience couldn't stand DiCaprio after his sappy role in this movie but most girls loved him. That's why the guys didn't went to see ""The Beach"" when it was released and also females didn't went to see it because this is a totally different movie and role for DiCaprio. So it was the wrong timing or the casting, both are possibilities, which caused this movie to not be a very successful one at the box office and among critics because they were not at the time quite ready yet to see DiCaprio in a totally different role, even though in the past he already had played a wide diversity of roles.

Too bad because the movie really deserved a better faith. Granted that it's no masterpiece but than again it doesn't really try to be one. The story doesn't really try to go deep, even though they could had easily gone that way with it. Instead it's a movie with multiple layers in it that go in good into some certain issues handled in the movie. The movie tries to be as realistic as possible even though the story at times certainly isn't. A reason why ""The Beach"" is just a good movie and not a great one.

The movie is beautiful looking and has some nice settings. The directing is quite original at times which helps to give the movie its own unique feeling. Also the story helps to make this movie an original one and it's quite thought provoking at certain moments.

Leonardo DiCaprio shows with this movie once more that he is more than just a pretty face. He's a real talented actor and this movie truly shows his, by many yet undiscovered, talent. Robert Carlyle is also great in a fairly small but still important role. A nice surprise in the movie was Guillaume Canet. This is a great French actor, who mainly only makes French movies and already has been nominated twice for a César Award. (Let's say the French Oscar for French movies.)

A simple entertaining movie made without any potential. Would it had been released let's say 5 years later it would had received a better faith and a more wider audience. A perfectly watchable movie but of course by no means a must-see though.

theBeach,"Not as good as the book, but still very entertaining",8/10,ecolifechoice,11/6/2018,"The film version of The Beach is not as gripping as the book, which is an absolute page turner. If you haven't read the book yet, I highly suggest you give it a read. The film is still very entertaining though, as it keeps you interested throughout, and is filled with beautiful cinematography and landscapes. Leonardo absolutely steals the show, as he does in just about all of his movies, and does a great job of portraying the young, starry eyed traveler Richard, who is seeking the ultimate journey and eventually is pushed to the brink of insanity by the utopia he was so eagerly seeking.

One way that the film bested the book, IMO, is by having Richard travel to the mainland with Sal for supplies instead of Jed. I think this was a much better way to depict the interactions and relationship between Richard and Sal, while also building more of an urgency for Richard to keep the others from reaching the island. It absolutely made more sense for Richard to fear being blackmailed by Sal over what transpired during their trip to the mainland than what transpired in the book.",pos
theBeach,Pretty bad but not horrible either,5/10,valentinvolland,14/5/2018,"I think this film is rather poor. I didn't like the soundtrack, it wasn't suitable and far too noticeable. I found the plot to be mediocre at best, but by far the worst part of the movie is the total lack of likeable characters. Except for the French guy I guess, all characters are utterly despicable with near to no redeeming qualities and they haven't been fleshed out that well. I can handle a film with unlikable characters and even love it sometimes, however in this film the other elements (plot, themes, fun) didn't counter this lack in well-developed or likeable characters. The cinematography was ok I guess and the acting was actually really good, as can be expected from Leonardo di Caprio and Tilda Swinton. But they couldn't save the film in my opinion.

theBeach,A movie by Danny Boyle with Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role. Can there anything go wrong?,7/10,michiostermann,23/4/2018,"The movie the beach was made in 2000 by the british director Danny Boyle. He made his breakthrough with the movie Trainspotting of the year 1996. He is responsible for many other good movies, for example 127 hours with James Franco, 128 days later or the very succesful slumdog millionaire. For me Trainspotting will be always Boyle's best movie. I have seen the beach approximately 1 year ago and i have to say that i wasn't dissappointed about this Drama film, even if the movie can't compete with the best movies of this british guy. Honestly the plot is not so exciting to watch this film more times. But an typical loosening Boyle atmosphere and easygoing Performance by a young Leonardo DiCaprio are enough for me to feel entertained. Leo is one of my favourite actors and i enjoyed it very much to see him in a not so mysterious role like in his younger movies Inception, Shutter Island or The Revenant. (Excepted The Wolf of Wallstreet) Finally i have to say, this film improved my mood and that's the most critical thing for me to recommend you this movie, especially if you like Danny Boyle and Leonardo Dicaprio movies in general. In the end i give this movie 7 from 10 possible stars.",pos
theBeach,Vastly underrated,9/10,zumo-16908,5/1/2017,"This movie received a lot of hate when it came out due to DiCaprio's fame with females after his appearance in Titanic (much like how everyone loves to hate Bieber today), and I kept far away from this movie for many years. I too only knew him from Titanic at that point, and when I saw him shirtless on the movie poster I had pretty clear assumptions of what this movie would be like. But I was wrong. This movie is great. Its a captivating 90s new age adventure with lots of twists and thrills, and i kicked myself for not watching it sooner. If you like Inception or Shutter Island, then i think you will like this one too.

theBeach,"Flawed, But Better than the Hate Suggests",10/10,generationofswine,26/10/2016,"For starters it is a Danny Boyle film and that goes a long way, he is a great director...but Leo, oh Leo, you were miscast. That role was supposed to go to Ewan McGregor and had it kept the intended actor, it would have been a much different beast, and one far closer to the novel.

Recasting Richard as an American, was in some cases, the biggest mistake. The insights he is supposed to deliver are more fragmented and make less sense coming from someone that isn't as close to Europe and the opportunities to experience the different cultures on a more regular basis.

The book itself is about a traveler and American's hardly do that. Gen-X might, but that is about all, one Generation of hopeless wanderers since the Beat Movement.

Still, despite the flaw it stands as a nice re-imagining, as a solid updated version of Thomas More's ""Utopia."" The monastery has been replaced with the commune. God with marijuana. The written correspondence with the internal monologue of a flawed protagonist. But the theme is the same. Utopia is no place. Void. It does not exist.

And the movie does a good job of capturing the hope of a Utopian offer and then revealing the truth behind that veil.

Had the casting been right, and not to say that DiCaprio isn't a great actor in his own right, but had the role of Richard been filled with the actor best suited for it, the film would have worked on a fundamentally brilliant level on par with Garland's source material.

Still, DiCaprio is a competent actor and he did his best despite the fact the role was wrong for him. The faults are small, but for some not easily over looked.",pos
theBeach,"Good movie, if not for everyone",8/10,851222,23/10/2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.

I always like ""The Beach"" (2000) more then it probably deserves it. I has breathtaking scenery, nature is itself is wonderful and it was wonderfully shoot. The story itself is simple yet more complex then it appears. This is not a straightforward adventure drama as it might look like, it tries to go a bit deeper, and it is even a pretty good character study movie.

Movie also raises some interesting questions from words of its protagonist Richard, he also has some interesting thoughts during the movie about humans being as vermin - trashing this planet to its core. When heroes of this movie finds safe haven on earth, it is not as innocent as it seems.

Overall, ""The Beach"" is a bit more then a simple straightforward adventure drama flick. Maybe sometimes it tries to do and show to much that it looses it excellent pacing and flow. But all in all this is a one hard to forget and not to enjoy movie experience.",pos
theBeach,Good towards the end,6/10,Arenas4812,17/5/2015,"I confess. I skipped this while it was out in the theater. I remember seeing a lot of trailers and promos for this. While it looked interesting...it looked real dull also. I decided to give this a try. It was really good. Tilda Swinton gives a great performance as the head of the island tribe. Leonardo is a mid-twenty something in search of life! Aren't we all? He winds up hitch hiking with a couple to a ""mysterious"" island. Where all the mid-twenty something's hike,fish,drink,etc. etc. While that seems corny, the plot at the end gets really good. And it had me hooked. If you have a lot of free time give this a try.

theBeach,No Day At the Beach.,5/10,anaconda-40658,5/5/2015,"The Beach (2000): Dir: Danny Boyle / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Virginie Ledoyan, Guillaume Canet: Intriguing film until one sees through its phony advertizing and dreary writing. Title regards opportunity and freedom, which is something the characters believe they've found until the fine print reveals unexpected dangers. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who is given a map to a paradise island. He ventures to the island and encounters people who made it their home. Lame subplots include shark attacks, romantic elements, and a dope crop. Director Danny Boyle cannot sort out the mess and hardly capitalizes on his success with Trainspotting. Ravishing production and photography are an asset. DiCaprio goes half way with his performance. He gains possession of this map and then inhabits another culture or lifestyle as well as romance two women but he goes through unexplained personality lapses in the third act that make little sense. Tilda Swinton is intriguing as an islander until she basically becomes a romantic prop. Robert Carlyle appears briefly with the map before he kills himself in a drunken state. Virginie Ledoyan and her boyfriend, played by Guillaume Canet accompany DiCaprio before also becoming a romantic prop situation. It addresses the perfect fantasy but as a film it is no fantasy and certainly no day at the beach. Score: 5 ½ / 10",neg
theBeach,Good,7/10,manitobaman81,22/8/2014,"A young man named Richard travels to Thailand and finds himself in possession of a strange map. Rumors state that it leads to a solitary beach paradise, a tropical bliss - excited and intrigued, he sets out to find it. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. That said, the main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the actors. It will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy. Find it today, even if you don't like this type of movie.

theBeach,Entertaining but often pretentious,7/10,Yesh4,20/5/2014,"^ should be a 6.5/10 but it doesn't let you do halves.

I love the plot,I've never read the book so I have never heard of any plot like this before. The movie is consistently entertaining but is often bogged down by pretentious and sometimes cheesy dialogue. DiCaprio is good in this but it is far far from being his best work because it doesn't showcase his talent fully. A lot of the supporting actors are badly acted and cardboard, resulting in this flick being not the most memorable of movies. I do, however,love the ending;it's quite beautiful and I love the whole family spirit theme going on. Soundtrack's really nice too with its soothing, uplifting songs.

Gulliver's travels is often discarded as a children's story but if you dig into the meaning behind it you realize it is a criticism of English politics and human behavior

The Beach in the same way is discarded as a teenage second rate movie but there is real depth to it, however may take some digging to uncover

You start to understand that billions think the same way as you ... it drives you to contemplate your so called uniqueness

The movie focuses on the origin of desire and how this can drive you in essence mad... great depth

I came away from that film feeling like I had not experienced a ,' whole ' , movie, because while it was a visually stunning travelogue of that country, it really had no plot to speak of.

I feel the same way about, ' The Beach', a film that is also visually stunning, but again, has no real plot to speak of (Unless you count a young Leonardo DiCaprio, & a bunch of other attractive people, cavorting around Southeast Asia, getting high, & having sex, apparently just for kicks).

So IF the visuals by themselves are enough to keep you entertained, then knock yourself out.

But to get through, ' tB ', I'll need to turn the sound down, & put on some smooth jazz...

theBeach,Don't judge it by it's cover!,9/10,toni-cooke18,26/2/2014,"I have seen this movie 5 or 6 times now. I think it is original and exciting. The soundtracks, the scenery are simply exquisite. I now watch this film because of missing Thailand and this film has the ability to take me back to the tranquility! However my stay was not as eventful as Richards..

I have read the book also and it again was much better than the film. The film is an eye opener and has inspired many travelers to visit the famous 'beach'.

I will be watching this film again and I do not understand the critical reviews it has had.

theBeach,Great,8/10,Joe-Owen,27/7/2012,"The most under rated film on IMDb It has great actors great soundtrack great storyline, great characters, great direction, its great, cheers and cheeers and cheeeeers on top.

This movie is so good its makes me wanna shake my tail feather and eat ice ream with my fingers so it hurts a little bit from the coldness on my fingertips, if you get what i mean. Damn, that story in the film inspired me to move to indonesia and live on a plantation and eat spicy food all day drinking cold bottles of beer on the beach with my mr blobby slippers on ..........

Oh and Leonardo Dicaprio is good in anything he does, lets face it

theBeach,Life changing drama,9/10,rdy-ever,21/2/2012,"I was just a kid in the year 2000 but I still remember that day like it was yesterday. It was a beautiful March morning and I skipped school to go and see a movie. I had no idea what I wanted to watch so I was wandering around on the Theaters Blvd. Than I saw the billboard for The Beach and I said to myself ""no way, I can't stand DiCaprio"". But as there were no other screenings I compromised and entered. I was not expecting to see life changing movie. But I was about to be stunned. The Beach is just so different from all the hocus-pocus action flick movies you see every f*****g day. Mainly a psychological mind-blowing drama, it sticks to your brain like s**t to the toilet: sure, it will clean after a few flushes, but it will always be remembered as the s**t that broke the pattern. Think of it like a theater of the absurd. It's f*****g brilliant.

theBeach,An underrated film,8/10,JTriska-280-686514,31/1/2012,"I watched it again recently and was struck by how the narrative and the various plot devices fit into the whole ""heart of darkness"" journey that is also seen in the works of Joseph Conrad and 'Apocalypse Now'. You basically have a character who is slightly obsessed with an idea and a vision, follows it to an extreme length and finally arrives at a place that is paradoxical and more than anyone is prepared to handle, both in the social and geographical sense, but also in the sense that Di Caprio's character goes to some dark places in his own mind. The film is layered - it could be seen as a parable of paradise gained/paradise lost, it could also be seen as one man's existential journey, but it could also conceivably be taken as a somewhat critical study of Utopian societies. The superficially happy and leisure-oriented hippies in the beatific 'commune' on an isolated island actually turn out to have some nasty characteristics: jealousy, ruthlessness, elitism and the usual fights for rank and control of the dialogue. The dope-growing Thai 'farmers' on the other side of the island are not as nasty as their image suggests but are ready to unleash lethal violence when they feel squeezed and exposed. I started to side more and more with these irritated, AK-47 wielding characters because their message of ""no more visitors on our secret island"" struck a chord. Man tends to overrun, overpopulate and exploit what had previously been beautiful places. Man also has the tendency to make some shady compromises and rationalize some heartless, cold behaviour (means justify the Utopian end). Anyhow, it's a deep film on that level. And if you don't want to watch something deep, the scenery, both natural and human, is eye-catching, and the filmmaking itself simply takes you on a weird trip through a colour-saturated paradise, with the occasional slice of hell dropped in it.",pos
theBeach,Leo's First Post-Titanic Film,8/10,Desertman84,9/1/2012,"For his first major project after the overwhelming success of Titanic, Leonardo Di Caprio took a risky path in this adaptation of Alex Garland's acclaimed novel and film directed by Danny Boyle in the movie called,The Beach.The film stars DiCaprio together with Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet. It was filmed on the Thai island Koh Phi Phi.

Richard is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck. Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do, Richard and his companions try to locate the spot, which, after a dangerous and taxing journey, takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in, but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in, and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important, there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors.

The Beach is unfocused and muddled.It was also a shallow adaptation of the novel it is based on. Only the gorgeous cinematography provides it great view. It simply gained commercial success due Leonardo Di Caprio's presence in his first post-Titanic film in a starring role.",pos
theBeach,Just When You Think This is Paradise....,8/10,manjodude,19/11/2011,"I had a pleasant surprise at the end of watching this movie but more on that later.

The Beach is a very thought-provoking, suspense movie like many of Leonardo DiCaprio's other flicks like Blood Diamond, The Departed, Shutter Island or even Inception. This guy has chosen a great variety of characters in his movie career, and this is one of them.

Pristine, breath-taking locales, wild suspense and also some class acting makes this movie a real treat to watch.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Carlyle as the psychotic Daffy stole the show. Others like Tilda Swinton as the leader of the clan in the island also provides good support.

Didn't see much flaws here except for the performance of Virginie Ledoyen as Francoise, Leo's crush. She wasn't much expressive.

Talking about the end of the movie, I'd a pleasant surprise when I saw the credits showing Danny Boyle as the director. That explains the great direction. It's Boyle's craft, the cinematography and Leo & Carlyle's acting that makes The Beach special.

Verdict: This movie is not just about a beautiful beach and its hidden treasures. There's more to it than you'd expect or accept....here's to good cinema!",pos
theBeach,Couldn't find the 2 hours away-from-reality I was looking for!!,5/10,CallMeK,21/7/2011,"If it wasn't for the nice scenery which was completely ruined by the non-existence of BlueRay edition, the movie would've been a complete trash, DiCaprio in this movie isn't only a bad actor but he achieved a new level of ""Sucking"" with his Rambo ill-imitation. The plot is yet too simple and you can see the end of the movie from the first five minutes, Adventure & Mystery (which is the movie lacked) is a package deal for the fans of this genre, adventure alone isn't enough. In fact my expectation were high at the beginning when I saw Robert Carlyle, based on his performance in 28 Days Later, he represents Mystery. No unexpected twist or a high climax or anything. If I wasn't trying to reach a certain number in my ""Watch List"", I would've turned off my laptop in the first five minutes, took out the DVD smash it repeatedly with the butt of my Philips screwdriver, then trash it and spit on it a couple of times. I guess Boyle wasn't as good as he's today.

Over & Out",neg
theBeach,Oh.,6/10,neil-476,1/5/2010,"I don't get this movie. Or at least I think I don't.

I have a sneaking suspicion that there's something meant to be going on beneath the surface here and, if so, I'm afraid it's beyond my ability to recognise what it is without assistance.

Which is a shame, because the series of almost-events which makes up this film is very eye-catching - beautiful at times, eye-catching at others - and the performances are for the most part good.

But I felt that the movie was giving the impression that more was going on than actually seemed to me to be going on.

Perhaps I'm just weird. Perhaps it's a weird film. Or maybe even both.

It's worth watching though, and maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.",neg
theBeach,Could have been superb.,7/10,kjm55-1,28/11/2009,"Let me start by suggesting that anyone who has seen this film and has not read the book to do so urgently. The book is an absolutely spectacular piece of literature compared to the film. Also, having such complimenting visuals to assign whilst reading which I will come to explain really make it worthwhile.

I have read in many sources that Danny Boyle did not bother to even read the book in preparation for his role as director. Very unfortunate, and this has major implications for the film. I will run through the film step by step. 1. Actor selection - generally extremely good. Some fantastic choices, really encompassing what people reading the book might imagine the actual people to be like. Tilda Swinton as Sal, the french couple, Keaty, Carlyle as Daffy - all brilliant choices. Dicaprio as Richard is also a fine selection. Boyle decided to deviate on the characters nationalities from the book, unusual but something I could live with. However for some bizarre reason one of the main and most intriguing characters from the book, Jed, is omitted entirely. Strange. 2. Location. Visually, this film was as true to the book and subsequently as perfect as can be. Fantastic real representation of what I only could imagine whilst reading the novel. 3. Plot and screenplay. Oh dear. Apparently the concept of utopia and the fascinating disillusionment of the characters with it was not good enough to sell cinema tickets for an evidently rather simple minded Boyle. He instead got rid of most of what made the book such a good read, and instead through together some petty romance to entertain viewers. Disappointing shortfall. These fictitious romances also altered the plot as well, and not exactly for the best. Boyle also deviated from the epic climax of the film. 4. The soundtrack. Wow. Fantastic auditory selections to encompass beautiful visuals. Although it was not the main movie theme song Pure Shores that really emphasizes what this work is really about, but instead songs such as Porcelain and 8 Ball.

Overall this film still scores pretty high on my personal scale. Unfortunately though it is a true tale of two cities - superb elements twinned with extreme disappointments. Would have loved to have seen this produced under the wing of a more competent and engaging director.",pos
theBeach,Keeps you glued,6/10,chapsmack,1/9/2009,"Danny Boyle is quite a director, no matter what you say. Here I am almost ten years since The Beach was released, and the movie still looked like it was released this week. From what I know Boyle makes most of his films based upon novels, and I make it a point to not read the novel to enjoy the film. The Beach doesn't disappoint and while some characters could have been more roles -- Ledoyen was practically paraded through the entire movie -- the premise and the beautiful locales make it a film worth watching. However I was confused by the ending -- not as much as how it ended but in the manner it ended. Altogether abrupt but worth the watch. 6/10.

theBeach,Poor scripting is insignificant as Brill Boyle sets up another wonder,7/10,Stampsfightclub,11/8/2009,"Richard (Di Caprio) stumbles across a map that gives the location to an island that contains all the elements for a peaceful existence.

Almost 10 years ago, Danny Boyle controversially left behind his Trainspotting and A Life less Ordinary star Ewan McGregor and was replaced by one of America's biggest stars for the leading role in the adaptation of Alex Garland's novel.

With Di Caprio still a heart throb after his roles in Titanic and Romeo and Juliet this was arguably the change in his career as he progressed into cinema's more dramatic genre. His articulate soft spoken style works wonders and whilst this is by no means his best ever performance, he is the necessity element that holds the script together.

As the film gets under way with the actor's narration explaining the formality of everyday holidays and the problems with the system Danny Boyle uses an element he lives for, the setting.

From 28 days later to Slumdog Millionaire the Bury born director simply knows how to set the scene in a way that is perfectly in line with the situation on screen. This beginning is perfectly realistic of a person in a foreign land adjusting to the scene as Di Caprio flits around the buyers and sellers in the market. But when the film finally reaches the beach does Boyle's presence really become profound.

It may sound cheesy but the setting sweeping notion feels as if you are right there on that island as Boyle swoops around the dreaming paradise. The helicopter shots and the bird eye view snaps generate a unique essence of the freedom and imagination of the supposed concept of independent holiday as Di Caprio and his friends end up in the midst of a hidden tribe.

The idea alone is brilliant. To escape and not have rules and regulations seems too sceptical for the everyday person like Di Caprio's Richard but after a run in with the marvellous Robert Carlyle the clues are dropped and the journey to the island itself is brilliant with some stunning shots in the water.

As the film progresses there are numerous factors that generate the essence of drama juxtaposed with fantasy. Richard's secret hinders with some questionable dialogue but the power of the performance neglects the scripting. There is an inclusion of romantic lust that is fairly predictable but the outcome certainly isn't.

There are other problems with this picture. For example the scripting is insignificant. Nothing is spoken unless it is a cue for drama to be created or for the plot to move forward. The bizarre game styled fantasy of Richard's is too out of place for the context of the moment.

The ending is a let down because of the way the conclusion was assumed. Nevertheless Boyle's filming and accurate talent at depicting the setting with the situation is the main reason to check this out.",pos
theBeach,Perfect for the unbearably hot recession-hit summer months,6/10,antileft,6/8/2009,"After seeing the movie for the first time , I must conclude that it is a very good product by D.Boyle , perhaps the most popular and financially successful British director to date ,whose film canon includes an impressive array of various genres , ranging from comedies ( Trainspotting ) to Sci - Fi with Sunshine ,and his last academy winner The Slumdog Millionaire .The Beach is a most welcome film for this Indian summer, as it deals with ,well, a last strip of paradise ,whose precise location is a sort of modern tourist legend, and the arrival of three youngsters ,led by Leo De Caprio , who discover a sort of modern hippie commune there, where love – read -sex and partner sharing – soft drugs –the island is virtually ideal for growing opiates !, briefly- carefree ' joie de vivre ' are the only rule ,and where the only contacts to the Thai mainland are restricted to the monthly procurement of necessities done only by the select few .The eternal bliss is , of course, doomed , as the inevitable ,namely the forces of nature ( diseases ,injuries –there are no doctors there ,and if the need be , you cannot - once on the mainland – return or disclose the location ! , and the most destructive one ,that is the most human one , jealousy ) dictate the lives there as well .This movie shows the true nature of modern tourist industry that cares not a fig about national , religious or cultural sensibilities( observe the depiction of now infamous Thai sex tourism ,making one wonder if there is really nothing else except girls and the indulgence of the most perverted sexual whims and proclivities !) , and draws its power from human gullibility , and , first and foremost, vacuous, meaningless and jaded human lives under the slogan of ' Enjoy '.",pos
theBeach,Definitely one of the most underrated movies out there!,8/10,Steinikr,22/5/2009,"I can't really remember when I saw The Beach for the first time, it was probably some time after it's release, 2000-2002. I remember though that most people didn't think too highly of this movie, which in a way, kind of bummed me out. I guess the majority of film viewers don't really feel like opening their minds too much, they just want something easy and then 2 hours later they go on with their lives. And with a film like this, that doesn't really work out. You have to give it some time and keep your mind open for incoming ideas. It's very philosophical in a way, which actually is one of the greatest things about it.

With time as I saw this movie once and once, here and there, I started noticing all the little things in this movie that really make it what it is; an outstanding example of excellent film-making. This movie takes you somewhere else... which in my opinion is a big point in film-making.

People who tend to glue themselves to the ground, over-analyzing details every step of the way; might not find this movie as rewarding as people who give in to every emotion that comes along the way.

The story follows the adventure of Richard, an American(the only two things we know about him) who's on his great journey to experience something unique.. something else than what is to be found in his everyday life. He eventually hooks up with two Europeans after he hears about this magical island, a paradise island covered with white sand and surrounded by crystal clear ocean. Without going into the plot more thoroughly I'll say that what struck me so hard about this movie is that, like said in the movie; that paradise is not a place you find or a somewhere you just go to. It's something you'll only find in time while exploring the abundance of landscapes, cultures, societies and of course all the visually stunning wonders of our world. It might not last long, maybe not even a second, but if you'll ever get there.. you'll remember it as long as you live. And our little protagonist is willing to go great lengths to reach that moment, even if there's the chance of death. Once in a place of purity, freedom and never-ending euphoria the character finds that there is a thin line between paradise and hell. How such beautiful places can so swiftly take away your sanity.

I'll say that I haven't yet had the courage to embark on such a great trip yet, I intend to. But meanwhile, this movie successfully takes me to that place of paradise where every problem just goes away. The soundtrack to this movie, combined with stunning cinematography is just something that makes you forget everything and sucks you into this world of perfection, where even the most lustrous shores can evenly be paralleled by hell.

Give this movie a shot and just use your imagination for a while. I watch this movie probably several times a year and it's one of those movies that just soothes me down.

I give this movie a 9 because it exceeded my expectations by far and gives me everything I expect from it. It fulfills it's role perfectly. Highly recommendable to anyone longing to travel the world, just to see something new.",pos
theBeach,Foreign Language,7/10,thebosnianmaniac,10/4/2009,"Does anyone know why they chose to speak that foreign language? I think it's Serbo-Croation. There's a couple of scenes in the movie where they go around to each person and they have to say that sentence about i have to ride my bike tomorrow in that foreign language. All in all the movie was okay with okay acting. But the french chick in the movie was very hot. I just didn't like the ending at all, they just leave the place they have been living for six years without a fight. Do fields of pot really exist in Thailand like the one's they showed in the movie? Did it seem like most of the tourists on the island were from Great Britain?",pos
theBeach,"""just another ASSHOLE suggestion""",10/10,torinforin,17/3/2009,"this movie is grand. it pulls you in and takes you to a whole new place. very well direction, and acting. the film pulls you in. i was flipping through channels on the TV and this was on. I COULD NOT CHANGE THE CHANNEL. it's one of those movies. as far as danny boyle. i would watch this over ""slumdog millionaire"" anyday. i thought slumdog was overrated and bland (""city of god"" was 10X better) this was so much better than that movie, in my opinion. the best way i can describe this movie is that it is like a good song. it pulls you in, transports you to a new world of beauty, and makes you feel certain human emotions and by the end of it you'll only want to experience it again.

theBeach,Pretty good but could be better,9/10,kurciasbezdalas,3/10/2008,"This movie have some similarities with previous Danny Boyle's movies but to me it appeared more Hollywoodish this time. But still this is a great movie. There is many adventures and some twists and that makes this movie very enjoyable. There were few interesting characters (like Robert Carlyle's character) and some funny scenes. Everything was great about this movie except the ending which could be much better. All actors did a great job, especially Leonardo DiCaprio (actualy i'm kinda surprised that Danny Boyle did pick Ewan McGregor for this role because he was really suitable for it but Leonardo DiCaprio also wasn't a bad choice). So if you are Danny Boyle's fan you'l probably like this movie.

theBeach,Great one,5/10,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,17/6/2008,"Leonardo DiCaprio sought to distance himself from the purity of his character in Titanic, and his role in The Beach is in many ways a polar opposite. As Richard, a young American seeking to ""suck in the experience"" of freestyle travel in Thailand, he's a chronic liar, a pot-smoking hedonist, an amoral lover, and ultimately an unstable snake in a doomed Garden of Eden. This crazy descent might be expected from the filmmakers of Trainspotting, but The Beach is a movie without a rudder, venturing into fascinating territory, promising a stimulating adventure, and then careening out of control. After receiving a not-so-secret map to a secluded island from a stoned-out loony (Robert Carlyle, full of dark portent and spittle), Richard sets out to find the hidden paradise with a young French couple (Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet). What they find is a tropical commune existing in delicate balance with Thai pot farmers, and before long--as always--there's trouble in paradise. There's trouble in the movie, too, as DiCaprio is reduced to histrionics when the plot turns into a muddled mix of Lord of the Flies and Apocalypse Now, with shark attacks tossed in for shallow tension. Director Danny Boyle attempts perfunctory romance and a few audacious moves (notably DiCaprio's vision of life as a violent video game), but what's the point? Tilda Swinton registers strongly as the commune's charismatic leader, but her character--and the entire film--remains largely undeveloped, and pretty scenery is no guarantee of a laudable film.",neg
theBeach,Good for the right audience,7/10,iamjcollins,12/3/2008,"It seems that The Beach receives extremely poor ratings, and perhaps with good reason. Leonardo DiCaprio may not be the ideal man for this leading role - in the original novel, Richard is English - but his performance is of an above average standard. While on the subject of acting, perhaps I may mention one of Tilda Swinton's worse roles. It's not that she is bad in The Beach, but she's not great either.

As a fan of Alex Garland's original novel, I find this film to be extremely Hollywood-engineered: An English lead character? A story without a sex scene? Where's the fun in that?! Still, even if like me, you're a fan of the source material, The Beach can still be a fun trip.

The story has a very escapist feel to it, and the narrative on-the-whole keeps us empathising with an increasingly disturbed Richard. Add to this a top electronic soundtrack that appeals to the characters (as well as the audience!) and you find that The Beach is not as bad as you may have been warned.",neg
theBeach,the beach,8/10,ikswortepnhoj,8/7/2007,"the beach is definitely the kind of movie that you'll either love or just laugh at...there are aspects of it that are certainly strange but overall, the message of the movie speaks to me. it's definitely one of my favorite movies because it appeals to a large part of my personality...which is represented in a lot of what richard says about never turning down an invitation, living in a generation that is willing to search the globe for something new and the fact that so many people leave home desperate to take a piece of it with them. its not leo's best acting job of his career but he pulls the character off well. and come on...""I may wish to have sex before breakfast"" is just a classic line.

It starts off with Richard (Di Caprio) who's travelled to Thailand and whilst there he meets Daffy (Carlyle), who gives him a map to find The Beach. When he arrives to The beach having already shacked up with Etienne and Francoise, you begin to get the vibe and feel of how it is within their self-sufficient community on this tropical paradise. I found this film entertaining, the soundtrack is quite simply amazing and it gives you inspiration to want to travel yourself ! I was staying in Ipanema Beach House (Rio de Janeiro) back in the summer of 2005 with many travellers and this movie brings back great memories of being there and meeting new people. The acting and shots were very good and the scenery was breathtaking.

Regardless of being a Di Caprio fan or not, if you love to travel, or you've had some sort of experience like I did staying in a youth hostel in a beach resort, this movie is for you, so discover the movie for yourself and ignore any negative press said about it !! Peace !!",pos

Let me be brief...this film is brilliant; visually stimulating, intelligently written and heartbreakingly realised. The fact people need to be spoon fed a characters motives is typical of people going to a see a film, with the idea of escaping from the realities of their lives. It seems most people were hypnotised by the blue skies and olive skinned brunettes to actually understand what this film is trying to say? Either that or their spoilt lifestyles left them no time to reflect and empathise with the human condition...if this is the case then they shouldn't even bother gracing the shores of this cinematic masterpiece as there's plenty of holes in the sand to be filled.

If you have indeed enjoyed some life experience - good or bad, then i suggest you watch this film and get lost in its sheer, yet relative, surrealism.",pos

The movie has a lot of good acting, and a good plot. I think everyone should give it at least one shot, before dismissing it.

The plot is definitely enjoyable, as it descirbes what all of us can relate to, growing up, looking back, the one we love, etc. It is definitely a good movie for those of us that have had some great past experiences, and are now living with that knowledge

While I was watching it, I saw an actor who I thought was Patrick Dempsey. I asked my husband to come and see, but of course he has to look everything up on the internet, first of all to find out the name of the movie, then he tells me that it is not Patrick Dempsey it is a French actor named Guillaume Canet, playing the character of Etinne. I still believe the French actor, ""Guillaume Canet"" is Patrick Dempsey (alias Dr. McDreamy). If not, Canet must be Dempsey's long lost/adopted out/identical twin brother. As soon as I saw him on the screen, I thought, oh so this was Dempsey's acting gig between the 80's and the Lifetime mini-series ""A Weekend in Pregatory"", before his big break with Grey's Anatomy. I can't be the only person that thinks Canet & Dempsey are one in the same or at least his identical twin brother!!! Once I saw this, it was hard for me to get into the movie except for some of Leo's ""Richard's"" scenes, especially the scene where Richard is having his nervous break down and actually sees three American tourist murdered in the marijuana field and then he starts running for his own life, which brought him somewhat semi-back as much as possible, to reality afterwards. If you agree, about the Dempsey/Canet theory let me know, even if I am five or six years late!!!",pos
theBeach,Ignored and underrated.,8/10,Cloud20,13/5/2006,"The Beach (2000)- 4/5

Leonardo DiCaprio, Virginie Ledoyen, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Guillaume Canet, Paterson Joseph. Directed by Danny Boyle.

Spoilers herein.

People often bash ""The Beach"" because of either two reasons: it is under-developed, or Leonardo DiCaprio ""sucked"" in it. I highly think differently on both counts. It is a film with an exhilarating direction by Danny Boyle with an interesting concept and characters.

A young, curious, nicotine-addicted man named Richard travels to Thailand in search of something new. He meets a crazy hotel neighbor named Daffy who tells him about a secret island that he refers to as paradise. Daffy kills himself shortly after and leaves a map for Richard. Curious on whether the island exists, he invites two French friends from the hotel to come with him on a journey to the island. They meet others on the island who have very similar interests to Richard about escaping the real world to paradise, but all of that can soon change.

""The Beach"" shouldn't really have as much negative feedback as it often gets. DiCaprio gives a good post-""Titanic"" performance, where he would later have even better roles (""Gangs of New York"", ""The Aviator""). Boyle's direction is solid and very crazy at times. The cinematography is stunning, and gives both a visceral blue and gritty picture.

There are only a few flaws, and the high majority of them are in the last 1/3 or so of the film. Richard's descent into madness happens way too quickly, and some of his hallucinations and thoughts are rather confusing. His character undergoes changes and is able to recover; I didn't really understand what the director was trying to say in that aside of giving references to films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and novels like ""Lord of the Flies."" Overall, ""The Beach"" is a movie that I can highly recommend to anyone who is need for something different, like the protagonist in the film. It gets better on each very, but isn't ever a perfect piece. While not a great movie, ""The Beach"" was an overlooked visual piece that deserves more respect than it gets.",pos
theBeach,In general a really good movie.,8/10,NoName1989,25/4/2006,"Before I saw the the movie there were some negative comments about the film. Those comments didn't say the movie was bad, but that it was disappointing, for director Danny Boyle. It said that the movie isn't by far as good as his other well known movie ""Trainspotting""

But, I don't really agree with those critics. (Almost) the whole first half of the movie I found really fascinating: very good acting and beautiful cinematography. Also the music is really excellent. After the first half the movie weakens a little, but it stays alright. Some people will find the end disappointing. The end is almost the same as in the book, and, I also found it a bit disappointing. In general, this is a real good movie, with good acting, beautiful cinematography, very good music and some memorable parts! If you haven't seen it, you really should see ""The Beach"" as soon as possible !

theBeach,Good film,8/10,earthlinkz34,24/1/2006,"I see that this film had the worst reviews the time it came out, but since i have this habit of liking some films even if they had bad reviews, i went onto check out this one....and I'm glad i did that.

I had read the book, so that was one reason i decided to check this out as well...Though it should be admitted that the story was altered a bit here and there..the film is fun to watch. Some characters are missing and the end is somewhat different too and Richard's affair with Francoise is more open in the movie. But you wouldn't get the fabulous photography or the wonderful soundtrack on the book r8...So i guess its worth it. Plus there are some extras available on the DVD like an alternate beginning and ending and some deleted scenes, story boards etc...

As for the movie...its fun to watch, maybe it gets a bit dull towards the 'Richard in the jungle' part, which is a bit too complex in the book too i guess... But the cast has done their part well...so has the director and props mainly to the cinematographer and all...",pos
theBeach,"lacking in concept, but can be watched for the adventure",6/10,Tanya-Ivanova,23/1/2006,"Starts promising, but turns out to be something of a promising waste of time. It is cool when he arrives in Thailand, finds the map and they swim to the island, because of the suspense and all (though not enough of that either). However, the disappointing thing is that the to-be-expected alternative people on the island aren't alternative in any significant way (except their clothes and makeover), and lack any kind of interesting alternative ideas that their life there, one would expect, be based on. They just created a relatively quiet and private city away from the city, and even buy most of what they need from the big city.

Anyways, I found DiCaprio's performance quite good, though his character was somewhat disoriented and finally kind of broke down psychologically as he got isolated and started getting high on shrooms. He kind of really whacked out.

I would have still been happy to see the movie as a good adventure in beautiful environment, but that you can't fully enjoy either since the sight of the shark stricken people in its middle is more than very hard to take calmly, though the styling of it is i suppose what would be called professional.

It is an OK movie.",neg
theBeach,I loved it,8/10,ad597731,30/11/2005,"well what can i say... i think that Leo is very underrated and can make even a movie like this with holes in the plot a f*cken awesome movie. It takes me away from my immediate environment and makes me feel like I'm on the beach... its just unfortunate when the movies over ... cuz I'm still here, and the beach is so far. Personally i think that Leo should have won his Emmy in whats eating gilbert grape? or even basketball diaries... hes such a strong actor who is often overlooked due to his young age and boyish charm. All i can say is give him what belongs to him.... Wheres Arnnie?!?!? not at the Emmy's that much i can say.

theBeach,One of the most under rated movies i've seen....,8/10,nextlevel,20/11/2005,"This film was great. It's not one to set your world alight but it really does do the job. I can't believe it came under so much criticism. It's well directed, well acted and well planned out.

The musical score is just perfect. Every scene has THE perfect music set to it. Moby's infamous 'Porcelain' tune was put in at just the right moment A hard-floor remix of Mory Kante's famous 'Yeke Yeke' was also a highlight of this movie.

The script was great too, had some great lines which you don't see in everyday movies. It's Definitely worth watching, and don't believe the 5.9/10 vote on here. Watch it for yourself and you'll know what I mean.

GOOD MOVIE!

theBeach,The Book Isn't THAT Much Better...,7/10,hokeybutt,5/9/2005,"THE BEACH (3+ outta 5 stars) Most people who are familiar with the book deride this movie as if it was a crime of the highest magnitude. Well, having read the book and not being overly fond of it (it was a good, light read and nothing more) I judge the movie to be a fine adaptation. Sure, they had to chop out some characters and situations and speed things along because it is only a 2 hour movie... but I think what they kept in is reasonably entertaining. The plot, dialogue and acting are all up to par. The movie as a whole may not be up there with ""Trainspotting"" or ""28 Days Later""... but as a ""star vehicle"" for rising young actor Leonardo DiCaprio it does the job... and the result isn't something that he should be overly embarrassed about as it keeps popping up in his resume. A young, pretentious American goes abroad to experience life as regular tourists seldom do. He hears of a mysterious island that is supposedly the closest thing to paradise on Earth.. but once he gets there he learns that people and paradise don't mix well together. The movie is not nearly as bad as the reviews of the time would have you believe... it's also not nearly as deep and profound as fans of the book would have you believe.",pos

theBeach,6/10.,6/10,regulusbellatrix,11/9/2004,"[NOTE: This review contains SPOILERS, proceed at your own risk.]

I didn't like ""The Beach"" or love it.

I don't know whether I liked DiCaprio's performance or not -- I was annoyed by his character, though, that's for sure. Tilda Swinton was pretty good in the role of Sal. Virginie Ledoyen, when the movie actually focused on her, was very good; however, she was rarely there, and just mainly served as The Love Interest, and nothing else. The movie could have been a lot better if it focused on the love triangle between her, DiCaprio and Canet's characters. The triangle was mostly useless, as Canet just let go of Ledoyen like *that* -- everything just seemed to go on without even acknowledging that Ledoyen had cheated on her boyfriend. Essentially no emotions are shown. IMHO, the love triangle could have just been cut out of the movie, as it was useless.

Up until Ledoyen cheats on Canet, I really liked this movie. The very beginning, I thought, was very nicely done, and I liked the character of Daffy. The scenery, too, was absolutely stunning.

Throughout the movie, I felt that it focused so much on fleshing out Richard's character  which it didn't do a very good job of  and mainly just focusing on *him* that it left out everything else in the movie that would have made it much better.

Overall, this film had potential, and if you just tweaked it a bit it could have been great. If you're ever in the mood for an all right film on a boring, rainy day, this is for you.

theBeach,possibly the only movie that leo will ever perform in...!,7/10,skips_r_nice,4/4/2004,"a great film! i must say that i did prefer the book (by alex garland)! but the film was exciting, dramatic, thrilling, humourous, adventurous and romantic all roled into one!!!

Ok, so im not saying it was the best movie ever, but it was thoroughly entertaining! leo outperformed himself, and was supported by a cast of stars who (although not always perfect) were great at the roles they had been chosen for!

a great piece of casting!!!

SYNOPSIS (SPOILER ALERT!)

ok, so we begin with this kid, richard, he's off adventuring in bangkok, in particular the gulf of Thailand!

he meets daffy, a crazed loonatic talking about a bitch (beach), in a hotel room one night.

Daffy slits his wrists, leaving the unsuspecting richard with nothing but a map. THE map! to a secret island said to be pure perfection, where a group of simple people live their blissful lives in peace!

Richard meets and falls in love with the beautiful Francoise! oh, and there's her boyfriend Etienne! Both have heard of the beach:the island of perfection, and accompany richard on his journey to find it!

Prior to his exit from bangkok, richard makes a copy of said map which he gives to some kids called zeph and sammy!

Rich, Etienne, and Francoise, make their journey by boat and by man power across the ""shark infested"" waters of the gulf of Thailand! on arriving at the island, all is apparently blissful, the three are accepted into the group with virtually no questions, but no paradise lasts for ever! Deaths of two Swedish men, Richard's unknowing copying of the map, the moral corruption of group leader Sal and Richard's stormy relationship with her and Francoise lead to his mental downfall. He becomes like daffy, crazed and a loner who finds enjoyment in the suffering of others!

eventually he snaps out of it and after a climatic scene with guns, betrayals and an eventual escape from hell!, richard returns home and retains only his good memories of paradise lost!",pos
theBeach,Should have been called-Lord of the flies-where they are now.,4/10,triple8,1/4/2004,"The Beach was a very odd movie experience for me. On the plus side, this was visually beautiful. What a feast for the eyes! Being a person who craves visually beautiful movies, that was a plus for me. Unfortunetly, the minuses are everything else. This movie was a letdown. It just was. It started out ok, not really great but maybe passable.Strong visuals from the start. Haunting. I thought it was going to be very David Lynch at first, it had that feel. Decaprio plays the drifter who wants to find paradise for the soul and he and a young french couple find it, in the form of a secluded beach populated by strange people, which comes to include the three above mentioned individuals.

Great premise-but the movie itself didn't pull it off. I'm still not sure what The Beach was trying to do. Or say. WARNING-THESE NEXT LINES WILL CONTAIN PLOT SPOILERS: The whole thing went from, if not spellbinding, at least surreal and a bit arty, to ""Lord of the flies-where they are now"". It was almost ridiculous. I soon tuned out, as the story became preposterous and almost a takeoff on a movie that I had seen in its ORIGINAL and loved dearly.

I have read many reviews on the beach, none very good, and I honestly understand why(although many times I don't agree with critics). This could have been SO SO good. It had an interesting story but ultimately dissolved into senselessness. The film didn't need to borrow from other films, it showed some promise of early magic-although I never felt it was GREAT, I did feel it had the potential to haunt me.

So, in closing, I have to say I didn't much like this movie but I may, unlike with most films I don't like, give it a second viewing(maybe not alone this time.) I would like to see what friends have to say about this one, so far nobody in my circle has seen it. It's a pity this disolved the way it did but if it turns out my feelings change on this one, I'll post another review. Right now I'd have to say about The Beach-Almost haunting, beautiflly crafted visually, movie that had promise-but went the way of absurd, disjointed Lord of the flies gone wrong.",neg

Acting is OK even if Leonardo Di Caprio over does it a few times. It could also be that he is just one of those actors who irritates me somehow. This was a disappointment after trainspotting.

theBeach,"A weak movie, but decent enough to hold up",4/10,Gav_tH,7/1/2004,"***This summary may contain ~SPOILERS~, depending on how strict you are on the term. I hope this warning keeps in with the IMDb guidelines. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone. That said, you have been warned***

~

There are a lot of good things to say about The Beach. As a novel, the book is apparently very well thought out and interesting. Unfortunately, despite a strong beginning and some standout acting, the big-screen adaption of The Beach fails to deliver a believable or strong story, yet holds up as an average, enjoyable movie.

I can't comment on the book, though I like what I have heard. Going by the screenplay, however, we follow Leonardo DiCaprio's character (very convincingly played) through his journey from Bangkok to a new home on and island resort. The premise is fairly simple, but is given some depth due to many subplots and character relationships. Many of the characters are likable, and Robbie Carlyle's appearance is fantastic and well directed. The film definitely has it's merits, and it's ability to build up tension throughout is a very commendable feat of it's director - there is definitely some haunting imagery through here.

However, I find I couldn't enjoy The Beach as much as I had hoped to. It is hard to tell just what sort of film The Beach actually is. At times, the story dips into farce with scenes that come across as unintentionally amusing - many things are hit and miss. For example, a CG sequence with a pixilated DiCaprio is very overdone, and kills a lot of the tension in the sequence. Moments like these not only feel out of place, but they ruin the general atmosphere of the movie and make it feel uncertain of what it wants to be. At times, I had the impression of it being a parody of itself, and yet, in others, there are moments of genuine tension and horror, with fantastic imagery and symbolism.

Most of the movie lives and dies by it's characters. Throughout most of the second act, many characters are developed, and it is this development that keeps the movie strong, as the movie changes slowly in it's tone from a light-hearted, easy going film to a dark thriller. The film definitely has character - something lacking from many films today - and it is this atmosphere and character that drives the movie forward.

The Beach isn't a horrible film, but I wouldn't say it was a favourite of mine. Apparently many characters were cut from this adaption, and as such that may account for some of the movie's poor plot progression. I am interested enough to read the novel due to watching the movie, but as a movie itself The Beach is weakly scripted and at times mis-directed. The dialogue is a tad overdone - DiCaprio's philosophy is intriguing, but doesn't seem to match up to the character we see on screen.

Despite all of it's flaws, The Beach does hold up and manages to drive it's journey to a definite conclusion - and does manage to stay entertaining. Personally, I think the movie could have been edited better. In my opinion, a few script redacts would have added to our ability to believe the story - the opening, while very impressive, is rather weak, and it's hard to believe any characters could act so impulsively. The script does feel unfocussed.

Despite a fairly sketchy script and these occasional missteps, The Beach manages to tell an intriguing story of a man who seeks for more from life, and because of this the viewer manages to stay interested. There are a few commendable moments, and performances are generally well-given all round. The production values are high and it shows - the set pieces are elaborate and beautiful. I feel many characters are underused - especially the supposed villains of the piece. But, all of these flaws can be easily overlooked if you simply sit back and enjoy what is there instead of what isn't. Despite wasted potential, I think The Beach is a decent, if not great, movie. It's not a life-changing experience, but watchable, definitely.",neg
theBeach,not as good,10/10,rossrobinson,21/11/2003,"I didn't enjoy this movie, as i did get very bored with this movie. This movie was made in 2000. A movie that was made in the 2000's. Leonardo Dicaprio is a fantastic actor. He starred and played the role in Titanic. I give the movie 2 out of 10.

So, some time after the bad press dies down I watch it. All going well, restless youth/Youth -> wide-world -> interesting Carlisle cameo (brilliant acting although this new Begbie should have reminded me of the Director). The story gathered a little pace and more interest and then...

Not too sure. Was it written this way? We're they given two days notice to finish the film, only half way through the film? The video arcade 'game'? The lack of plausible reason for DiCaprio losing his senses? The inconsistent moral structure in the troup.

Rent the film. Send it back to the store when you get to 'the' lagoon scene. Trust me.",neg

theBeach,Good as a Di Caprio vehicle,7/10,perfectbond,4/3/2003,"While the film seems to be a meandering collage of genres, it is held together securely enough by the presence of its talented star, Leonardo Di Caprio. I want to say that I'm not praising 'Leo' because of his looks or because he is a 'heartthrob.' I simply enjoy the performances of this immensely talented young actor and found his work in The Beach to be up to the high standards he has established for himself. Besides 'Leo' the film is also memorable for its breathtaking cinematography. A better than average film, 7/10.

theBeach,Well shot... but against the book: NOTHING!,5/10,The_Coma-Man,11/12/2002,"I have to say, that I read the book and that it is one of my all time favorites.

When I heard that Danny Boyle directed ""The Beach"", I wanted to see it, because I absolutely love his films. And, after all, the Beach was a well shot movie with good scenes and so, but... well... many points and the whole meaning of the book were taken away. For example: The second lead role (a hippy with a long beard) was taken out completely. Maybe, because the scenes he was featured in were too violent or disgusting (especially the ending that was completely changed) for a Hollywood film, and Sal, who was described a bit like Drew Barrymore (friendly, big, attractive and calm), the real opposite of her film-character, became the really worst villain in film history.

There are many bad points in ""the Beach"", but I can't tell them all. But what annoyed me the most was the ending: The original one had to do with hate, paranoia, trust and even racism and gives you this ""alone"" feeling. The ending in the movie was too... happy. ""Everything's okay, all in the right place again..."" and so on. Also, the brilliant dream sequences who came after every chapter were taken out... also because of violence...

""The Beach"" tries to be a good story, a PG-13 version of the book, but is still too far away from a teen movie, making it look like a childish mixture-version of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Apocalypse Now!"". Read the novel, it is BRILLIANT!!!!

theBeach,Picks up,10/10,fiteclub!,18/2/2000,"What starts out as a very good beginning slows down but nevertheless remains a satisfying first act. The movie takes a turn for the worst, however, with a very hollow and pointless second act, where nothing important, if anything at all, happens. But Danny Boyle and the Trainspotting crew are no fools. They don't let a film suck without doing something about it! The third act takes off and does its best to revive the sagging film, and you can't help but love Dicaprio's, uh, bonding time with nature. A very uneven film but all around an enjoyable two hours.

possible spoiler: My one gripe: the film suffers from the LA Confidential syndrome. There is a perfect semi-tragic and real place to end the film, but it was abandoned so the audience would not feel ""isolated"". We're not all conformists. We don't need to hear some Lilith Fair song about love and peace come on after a bunch of people got shot and killed. We don't need ""happily ever after"". We're big boys. I can understand that the filmmakers knew their target audience was young, so they wanted to have a nice ending with Leo smiling. Well I'm fifteen and I'm one of those people who saw Titanic 14 times with my girlfriend. I may be young, but I'm not stupid. I know when I'm being spoon-fed, and well, in a film that dives into the furthest depths of human insanity, I don't need to see Leo grinning over a crappy iMAC at an internet bar so we can all feel good about ourselves at the end of the day.",neg

Well the thing is not so bad, but it is definitely for an MTV audience. Some of the scenes are stunning and amazingly beautiful. The first half is interesting enough, and makes you attentive to the story. But then, it seems to be a mish mash of video-clips. The Game Boy scene is kinda funny in the delirium part of the movie. But the psychology of it all is pretty primitive, and could have been much better.

All the ""drama"" scenes seem to be picked up somewhere else. I suppose the director was making a wink to Apocalypse Now at some point, if not, he really messed up that part of the story. And the character development in the club-med-in-paradise environment could have been MUCH better.

It could have been a great movie, but I think they pushed hard to put Leonardo too much in front of everything. Good acting, I must admit, but overshadowed by a movie that tries to be too much of everything at the same time : ecology, sociology, humanism, sex, vacation, action, ... Too bad.",pos
theBeach,A missed opportunity....,5/10,mooncow,17/2/2000,"Having waited months for this film, the final result was very disappointing. Originally seeing a trailer way back in June of '99 I immediately read the book, which was amazing. However the film just doesn't work. The story is changed way too much, characters and events left out or changed for unknown reasons and the new additions detract from it. People with me who hadn't read Alex Garlands novel found it difficult to follow some themes and the terrible video game sequence just capped off the pretty boring middle piece.

Too much has been crammed into a short period of time and as such the audience catches only hints of the information they need to understand why people act as they do.

This is all annoying as an opportunity has definitely been missed. The scenery is perfect and the cast really well assembled, DiCaprio makes a great Richard. Why, why, why did they have to mess around with the story line.

Plus just to annoy me even more, the great music which accompanied that original trailer didn't appear once!",neg
theBeach,"Very surprised, for a few good reasons.",10/10,neil.harris,16/2/2000,"Let me just begin by saying that this review may be seen by some as biased. I didn't like DiCaprio in Titanic, and thought that he overacted terribly. There, now on with the review. There are no spoilers, so don't worry.

The Beach is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, Leonardo DiCaprio was supurb as Richard, and he complimented the script very well with romance, action and psycho turns that were as disturbing as they were scary.

The supporting cast were very good, and Danny Boyle's direction was spot on. You would think that the plot line (boy goes to find Beach and live there) would not be that interesting, but this film is so much more. It is a tale of intrigue, romance, jealousy, and action, which is perfectly surrounded by the most beautiful environment I have ever seen. Lets just hope the rumors were wrong, and they left it the way they found it.

If Leonardo ever needed a boost into respectable movies after the mediocre Titanic, then this is it. It might not take half as much at the box office, but dumps all over it in all other areas.

Simply unmissable. A classic.

Based on reviews, I was expecting this movie to really stink. But I found it to be a nice escapist fantasy movie with some likeable characters and interesting themes. I also read many critics knocking Leo's performance. I couldn't disagree more, I thought Leo performance was pretty good. He was funny at times, goofy, serious. Remember he is only in his early 20s and his best work is probably yet to come. So if you are looking for an interesting movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a few moments, check this one out (at the very least the beautiful Thailand scenery is a nice respite from our brutal winter)

Leo looked VERY good in it too. You can tell he went to the gym. I also think that the reason people are saying it is so bad is because they were expecting it to bring in money like Titanic did. Just because it has Leo Dicaprio in it doesn't mean it's going to do as well, but $15 million dollars, I think is a lot of money. Besides, it was rated a 6 and that's certainly above average. What's wrong with coming in second? If you ask me, I can't understand why Scream 3 is doing so well, I thought both the first and second ones sucked!

theBeach,"Good, but with blemishes.",7/10,Dark Hellion,14/2/2000,"When all's said and done, this is a good movie.

Unfortunately, it's not *quite* top ten material.

I like Leonardo Di Caprio - I have ever since Romeo and Juliet, although I've never seen Titanic (don't hit me!). In _The Beach_, he is good - his acting was definitely up to standard. However, there is a sequence in the middle of the movie where Danny Boyle (the director) seems to lose the plot a little.

Something happens to Di Caprio's mind (I'm not going to say what), but we're never really given an adequate explanation for it. It's like twenty minutes of the film was left on the cutting room floor.

Having said that, it's an interesting take on the _Lord of the Flies_ theme. Rather than order descending into chaos and savagery, it's more a movie about what happens when there's too much order, and people become unable to give that order, that comfort, up. What happens when you're too scared to leave your comfort zone? Well, watch this movie and you'll find part of that answer out.

Altogether good, but not great. A seven and a half.",pos
theBeach,Danny Boyle Gumbo,6/10,draftyrafters,13/2/2000,"What's disappointing about The Beach isn't the cinematography, which is great, or the plot, which is okay, or the acting, which is good. It's the trailer. Have you seen this thing? It makes the movie out to be some fast-paced, thrill-a-minute, will they make it out alive fright-fest. And it is absolutely none of those things.

The movie is about American traveller named Richard. Played very well by Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard stumbles across a map that reveals the location of some perfect little island, a paradise, if you will, and being an impetuous and free-willed young man, Richard decides to go there, accompanied by a young French couple that he has only just met.

On this island are two things: 1) enough marjuana to keep all of Ann Arbor busy for a few months, and 2) drug dealers. Barely escaping the drug dealers, our protagonists manage to find the other half of the island, which is populated by kind and reserved people who have decided to reject the outside world and create a perfect little society on this gorgeous island that virtually nobody else knows about.

This community has a long-standing pact with the kind-hearted drug dealers. They co-exist in peace as long as they tell nobody else about the island. Everybody's happy.

The plot doesn't have much going for it, other than it is a vehicle for some pretty heavy sociological/philosophical messages. But despite the scanty use of conflict in the film, the movie as a whole is fairly entertaining. Directed by Danny Boyle, The Beach has a lot of the same sort of stuff that can be found in Boyle's other works. It has the same gritty sound and speed as Trainspotting, but it also has the confusing and out-of-place weirdism of A Life Less Ordinary. In fact, even though I give this movie a cozy two thumbs up, there are three problems with it that may bother more discriminating viewers.

1. A forced love story. Anyone who knows movies knows that all producers want some sort of love interest in their movie. It gets the attention of the female viewership. In many cases, this is pulled off without a hitch. In the case of The Beach, it is almost as if they made the entire movie and then, as a second-thought, realized they needed some kissin', and so they dumped in a horribly contrived and emotionally weak romance between Leo and the young French lady. 2. An unnecessary soul-quest, a la Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors. At some point, Leo goes crazy for fifteen or twenty minutes as he wanders about the jungle. This has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film. It's like a commercial for insanity. 3. The final moral of the movie is imparted by the kindhearted ring-leader of the drug dealers, who doesn't just vocalize the moral, but delivers it Solomon-style: with this obscure and insightful test of the hidden resort leader's faith. Although this is plausible in Danny Boyle's world, I doubt the drug dealer's would have imparted anything to the head-strong island citizens other than a volley of bullets. But, then again, I'm not an expert on drug dealers.",neg
theBeach,DiCaprio isn't just another pretty face.,10/10,Midnightcat,12/2/2000,"I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and then lost faith in him after Titanic. I was sick of the whole teen heartthrob/posse-towing bad boy image. But The Beach put Leonardo back in my good books. If you enjoyed Trainspotting, chances are you'll like The Beach, from the same power team that gave us the Scottish heroin romp. This time it's an isolated island paradise instead of Scotland, pot instead of heroin, and Leonardo DiCaprio instead of Ewan MacGregor. The Beach is a visually stunning movie with a soundtrack that blended seamlessly with the beautiful visuals. The acting was incredible, with not one single disappointing performance. The movie was both funny (the video game sequence) and scary (the shark attack), just as much of a nightmare as it was a beautiful dream. With any luck we will start seeing Leonardo DiCaprio in more roles that portray him as more than just your average pretty boy, because it's once again obvious that he's a fantastic actor.

theBeach,Nothing (much) new under the sun,4/10,mar9,26/11/2001,"Leo di Caprio flaunts his hairless chest, eats a caterpillar and goes nuts on a tropical island. The End.

This film about a dope-fuelled utopia hidden on a remote tropical isle off Thailand could have been much better. The first half is strong, and seems to follow a strong theme of travelling in hope being better than arriving. Robert Carlyle puts in a good but brief role as the crazed Daffy. Once the story arrives at the legendary beach, the film gradually unravels. Di Caprio may be a charismatic screen presence, but he doesn't have the acting ability to bring the story to life. The sequence in the jungle where he loses his marbles is particularly weak. Tilda Swinton, who is one of but a few reasons to watch this film, acts rings around him.

Bits of the film evoke other movies such as Apocalypse Now, Dr Strangelove and Lord of the Flies. This would appear to follow the book on which this film is based, in which the central character is obsessed with films and video games. This works okay in novels, where it is possible to transplant things from other media to fertilise a story, but if it's not done right (and it is not done right here) it only makes the film appear derivative. The novel ""The Beach"" was popular and very successful and this film would appear to be a sub-standard adaptation. Wonder why they changed Richard's character from English to American, hmm?",neg
theBeach,This movie can't decide what it wants to be about,5/10,basrutten,22/11/2001,"'The beach' has really left me with mixed feelings. I wanted to hate the movie because Leonardo diCaprio plays in it, but in spite of his presence, The Beach is not as bad as I expected. One thing that's remarkable is that Leo's character is kind of a jerk, which is a welcome change from the one-dimensional idiot he played in 'Titanic'

The first half hour of the movie is terrible, however. Corny dialogs, stereotype tourist character and an annoying voice-over. After that, the movie gets a little better, especially the scenery (the tropical island) is breathtaking, and the movie even manages to be funny sometimes. Plus, there is a certain charm in the idea of a hippy commune living on a beautiful, deserted island.

Unfortunately, the movie can't decide what it wants to be: an action movie, a romantic drama, a satire on the consumer society, a 'Blue Lagoon'- clone etc. It contains parts of all these movies/genres, but it moves constantly from one genre to the other.

All in all, I found the Beach to be moderately enjoyable, mostly because I just wanted to see what happened next, even though that what happened usually didn't make much sense. with a LOT more focus on psychology, the Beach would have been a good movie. As it is now, it's confusing and a little boring, but not total crap

His acting was just not up to par in this film. And what a terrible waste of the always great Robert Carlyle. But I don't think that any caliber of acting could have saved this mess of a movie. The script was just not good. The story seemed to want to go somewhere, but it just never made it.

theBeach,Methinks the people doth protest of Leo too much...,10/10,Tippledom,12/2/2000,"What's with all this Leo angst? He's been in a couple of good films (Basketball Diaries, Gilbert Grape) and is seems as soon as you mention his name to anyone, they immediately roll their eyes to the back of their heads like a reflex. So he was in Titanic...let's let of that and give the guy a chance.

Sure, I went into The Beach with my doubts. I read the book and I wasn't too sure how that was going to translate to the screen. While not perfect, it did turn out well, and managed to capture a lot of the novel, (as much as you can actually in a two-hour movie). The music and sound for the film were both excellent, and I highly recommend seeing it while still in dolby theatres. The locations, both tropical and urban, were beautifully shot, and again, held to the spirit of the book.

The characters were a little underdeveloped, but I think they got Richard (DiCaprico) a wanderlust traveller in search for something new, down pat. I love the fact that most of the actors were foreign, including French Actress Tilda Swinton.

Don't go (or not go) to this film just because Leo is in it. It's a movie based upon an excellent book and, in my opinion, beats out most of the brain-dead flicks of late.",pos
theBeach,Views from a disappointed movie-buff,4/10,galemos,16/4/2001,"A superficial rendering of the book, with limited acting range and facile situations. I nevertheless enjoyed the different ending. All the characters, even DiCaprio's, are boring and lacking in any psychological depth. I found the plot disjointed. The scenery is wonderful, but doesn't by itself make the film worth seeing.

theBeach,Great FUN film,9/10,mmpardon,12/2/2000,"This film is a great adaptation of the novel. It genuinely captures the naturalistic themes expressed by Garland. It also incredibly captures the feel of the generation it appeals to, the late-teens/early-twenties crowd. And let's face it, the reason we go to the movies is to have FUN. Isn't that what ENTERTAINMENT is all about? Don't expect life-changing revelations when you go to the movies. Read a book.

This film is definitely worth your time. The setting, cinematography, and action is amazing! The soundtrack is great too.

Unfortunately this movie has little else going for it. It seems that when the producer and director were assembling this mess they forgot one thing, namely, a good writer. Apart from poor writing this movie has been directed (or edited)so that the pacing is jumbled and inconsistent. It is difficult to know whether the audience is expected to take this movie seriously or whether it is intended to be a comedy. If you like beautiful beaches and lots of tanned skin give this movie a try but if you find yourself getting bored after 20 minutes be forewarned - that's all there is to it.

Not once did I laugh or cry, or have any emotion tweaked in it's entire running time. It seems to me that filmmakers have always had trouble conveying any decent story set in a tropical place- ""The Blue Lagoon"" anyone? How about ""Six Days, Seven Nights""? Even the recent ""Castaway"" had trouble telling its story by just jumping to ""Four Years Later..."" in the narrative.Oh well.

theBeach,Ugly Americans aboard,4/10,tonpro,12/2/2000,"Following in the sandals of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" Hollywood's latest foray into the lives of people on perpetual vacation is ""The Beach.""

This film could be worse, but it would have to work at it. Leo DiCaprio tries hard, but he isn't really given much to work WITH here. He is a character without motivation amid a cast of characters without motivation.

Each and every person on this mythical island seems to have been born the day they got there. None of them even have last names, much less lives. That makes it a little hard for the audience to care whether they live or die, much less find the perfect beach upon which to squander their time.

DiCaprio's character in particular is an annoying,whinny, whimp who seems as unlikely a figure to build a film around as any I've ever seen. And those are the characteristics he starts off with. By the end of the film, you think everyone would have been better off had he expired on the swim to the island.

But the real disappointment is Virginie Ledoyen. When will good French actresses learn that coming to America gets them nothing but a chance to wave at the Statue of Liberty? Ledoyen, who has done some great work in France, essentially gets to do nothing on ""The Beach,"" except look fetching in a bikini. But she could have taken the flight straight through to Tahiti and walked around in one of those.

In the end, this was a waste of a lot of good acting talent on a typical, pointless Hollywood project that could not have been made in the first place without the participation of that talent.",neg
theBeach,"Passable, but nothing outstanding.",3/10,JamesAnswer,12/2/2000,"I was looking forward to Danny Boyle's latest, and I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. I was disappointed on both counts. This film is by no means atrocious, but after a year of so many good films, I just can't recommend this one. The plot drags and the characters are for the most part unlikeable. The soundtrack is the main high point of the film (the only part as good as Trainspotting), featuring some great tracks from Blur + UNKLE, as well as a nice score from Angelo Badlamenti (of Twin Peaks fame).

Sometimes I felt I was seeing a travelogue or a Club Med ad. Teenagers may swoon over diCaprio - I don't. Annoying voice-over is like canned laughter in sitcoms. Why all this emphasis on diCaprio? Because he is the big star and HAS to be featured in a big way? We find out very little about the others. 5/10 and no more from me

What was wrong? 1) Francoise isn't captivating 2) Stupid,irrelevent jealousy scenes 3) too faithful to the book to be a good film, but not faithful enough in the critical points.4) Caprio is wrong actor 5) The thing about the book is that Richard gradually goes bonkers, but you don't realise it till he's insane. In the film they don't know how to do this

Sorry the film somehow didn't capture Thailand, back-packing it was flat, I was keen for the credits to roll.

theBeach,It's time to go to Thailand,9/10,Jassim-2,12/2/2000,"The film is both stylistically and asthetically beautiful. The director goes beyond the classical just as in Trainspotting which has some similarities. These take the film further beyond reality, ultimately making the beach seem even more spectacular.

The acting varies but is quite realistic. If you have ever back-packed, you'd find the characters believable. Yes, Americans really do stick out that much. Leonardo Di Caprio seems completely immeresed in his role and acts well (despite what jealous boyfriends and husbands might say).

A big plus is that the film is quite different to what most expect from today's 'feature length' trailers. It's rated R for a reason (or two).

The book is fantastic and films rarely do books justice. I think the studio did a good job of selecting which parts to exclude and where to use some artistic merit. It's pretty ridiculous for anyone to expect a 2 hour film to incorporate and entire book. It's always funny when people complain a film wasn't how they imagined the book. What are the chances of that?

Ignore the Titanic comparisons, this isn't about a sinking ship. Go see the movie with an open mind (don't read any more reviews!) and you'll enjoy it.",pos

theBeach,Noir Bizarre,4/10,FlickJunkie-2,20/8/2000,"Leonardo DiCaprio must have been very desperate for an antihero role to agree to this turkey of a script. No amount of camera magic by Danny Boyle or idyllic locations could save this dreadful story. It spasmodically progresses from implausible, to inconceivable and finally to demented. It is Fantasy Island' meets Apocalypse Now'. The only way to classify it would be Noir Bizarre.

John Hodge and Danny Boyle team up to prove that one success in avant-garde filmmaking (Trainspotting) does not necessarily spill over into future projects, though I must say that Boyle's direction was the only thing that kept this film from being a total disaster. His brilliant camerawork and cinematography helped keep my mind off the peculiar and disjointed content.

As far as the acting goes, this was The Leonardo DiCaprio Show. Though there were additional characters in the film, other than a cameo by Robert Carlyle they were the equivalent of extras that had been elevated to speaking parts. DiCaprio gave a good performance, but his character was so mercurial that it is hard to say he really nailed it. He ran around with his shirt off a lot, so I guess that will keep the teenyboppers happy.

I rated this film a 4/10 on the strength of the cinematography. The story was a 1 or 2 at best and DiCaprio was not enough to elevate it to the level of mediocrity. This is a film for die-hard Leo fans only.",neg
theBeach,"Left on ""The Beach"": the nerves of the viewers",3/10,voelker.r,19/1/2000,"It´s hard do believe that the british director Danny Boyle, who surprised us with ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" made this horrible film. The story, if there is one, is a disgusting mixture of ""Apocalypse now"", ""The Jaw"", ""Lord of the Flies"" and holiday impressions from Thailand. Although I have never been to this country it´s very difficult to understand why Boyle is unable not to speak and to show pictures that are full of clichés. Above all the performance of Di Caprio is nothing special and so does the rest of the crew. ""The Beach"" is a waste of time because Boyle never show really interest in his characters or in his storyline. And for all people who where eager to see Di Caprio in his first movie after TITANIC will be surely disappointed. I was and I´m sure you will too. So Mr. Boyle - one good advice to you: Go back to Europe and make again films like ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave"". The Audience will be pleased. And one advice to the us-public: save your money for better films!

theBeach,Potentially Interesting Theme,5/10,harry-76,31/7/2000,"""I settled in and found my vocation--the pursuit of pleasure,"" shares Leonardo DiCaprio's Richard, shortly after arriving at his dream vacation spot: ""the beach."" The trouble with this thesis is it is ultmiately an unsatisfying goal. Vacations and parties must end sometime, and work begin.

As surely as human nature seems to require both projects and play in equal measure, life skewed toward recreation alone is bound to become a boring and unfulfilling existence. This state can lead to dire consequences and may even point the way toward tragedy. Novelist Alex Garland and writing assistant John Hodge try to depict this in a quite dramatic screenplay. Somewhere along the way, however, the essential theme got lost, and one may leave a viewing of ""The Beach"" wondering what was its actual purpose. Deleted scenes included in the DVD format surprisingly help to clarify some thematic features missing from the finished narrative. Likewise, key character profiles, like those of Robert Carlyle's Daffy gain better understanding through these cut scenes. As the writers' objectives seem basically sincere, it's too bad this narrative fails in its loftier expressive aims. Utlizing inherent creative urges appear an important aspect of our satisfaction, and that encompasses a good deal more than what ""the beach"" alone can ever provide. ###",neg

And the plot is full of holes too. Oh, and sharks don't attack humans very often, either.

theBeach,"Excellent location, Richard, Françoise and Etienne",5/10,oaktree_pf,8/7/2000,"Those which have read the book should agree that the island described in Alex's Garland novel is exactly the same as that on the movie, as well as all of the characters. The film though very interesting on the first 2 thirds, becomes a bit boring on the last one. The film should have given more detail on each of the characters, specially on those as important as Jed, who doesn't appear on the movie, Sal, Bugs and Keaty, and their relation with the rest of the comunity of the beach. The cast is very full filling specially CiCaprio's realism and Ledoyen's appearance of strength and vulnerability. I think that the movie should have kept loyal to the novel and do not invent part of the happenings while they ignored some very important (like the three with the inscriptions next to the waterfall or the continuous visions richard has of Daffy. Overall a good movie which is worth seeing as well as reading Alex Garland's Book, which will give you a better idea of what was the life in The Beach like, if u are really interested and want to know more.

To me this movie was like Fight Club in the way it was viewed where I live in Vacaville, Ca. F movie. When both of these movies were very good. Both books are about people who go on psychopaths and have an imaginary friends who they actually conversate with. Both movies show the steps of someone going mad and then realizing what they did or are doing then trying to become the person they once were. Both movies deserve a 10 in my perspective.

See both movies even though. They are the same but then completely different.

theBeach,Great film with a brilliant story!,9/10,winslet7,20/4/2000,"Though I do prefer the novel for The Beach, I quite enjoyed the film as well. It was a mistake to hype it as a blockbuster return for DiCaprio, though, as it has the feel of an indie movie, which I prefer.

The lead character, Richard, is someone we can all identify with. And we see a wide range of emotions, from adventurous to bordering on insanity, romance to fear. And DiCaprio pulls it off with ease. Definitely in his proper place doing a darker character with plenty of twists and turns.

Viginie Ledoyen was excellent as Francoise. I look forward to seeing more of her work.

The direction was excellent, and the cinematography breathtaking!

After seeing footage of what the beach they filmed on looked like originally, and comparing it to how it looked once they were done, I would think the Thai's would be happy! It was littered and obviously uncared for prior to all the hard work this team put into it.

If you have already seen this movie and you really liked it, READ THE BOOK! The book is so much better. Though the scenery in the movie was vivid and stimulating, your mental pictures will be more rewarding, believe me.

Leonardo definitely doesn't belong in his role of Richard. The movie messed up all the conflict he has dealing with his lust for Francoise, etc. Obviously, I made the mistake of seeing the movie after reading the book. I won't say it was bad, just disappointing. They really change a lot to put it on the screen. The reason I give the movie a ten is because the soundtrack to the movie is brilliant. If you are a music buff, see the movie just for the music.

I myself have read the book and would agree that some parts are left unclear but that's probably the only factor in which the movie lacks. However, I'm sure that if the viewer concentrates on the beautiful scenery, superb acting and perfectly chosen music, the unclear parts will fade away. Also, the movie is definitely worth seeing on the big screen, especially because of the breathtaking nature. Strongly recommended.

But the film lack the depth and weight it should've had - the only moment in the film when you really feel weighed down by the life and choices these people live every day, is when the (swedish) fishermen gets shark bitten. That felt like a soft punch in the solar plexus when it should've felt like a truck hitting you.

As or the end, well...there really were no surprises there, it was obvious that it would turn out the way it did.

According to many intelligent screenwriters, directors, and us critics, conflict is the basis of all drama. If there is no problem for the main character to solve or something for him or her to achieve, there is no purpose for the character's state of being. Without character we can have no story. Without story we can have no movie. The new sexy, glamorous novel adaptation from ""Trainspotting"" director Danny Boyle, runs into that rare, insidious flaw: other than some irrelevant singular character tensions, there isn't much conflict in its plot. The film primarily consists of a slew of related events placed side by side. Thus, many of the scenes do not propel the story forward. The conclusion doesn't even know where to commence because there is nothing to explicate.

The filmmakers cast Leonardo DiCaprio as a young American traveler named Richard, who, as the movie opens, arrives in Thailand in quest for an adventure that can't be found in the common tourist locations. We don't know a whole lot about Richard except that he is a drifter named Richard. He rationalizes in the premise that nothing else matters, an extremely lazy method for the writers to escape character development. In reality, background information does indeed matter, and for us to care about him, we need to know more.

Early in the movie, Richard meets an erotically appealing French woman, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and her boyfriend, Etienne (Guillaume Canet). Soon afterwards, he stumbles upon a pot smoking, insane individual named Daffy. This strange person rambles about a paradise-like island that unseen by most people. Richard believes little this man states, but the next morning he discovers Daffy has killed himself and left him a map leading to this mysterious beach. He asks Francoise and Etienne to travel with him to the island . They accept his invitation.

Robert Carlyle doesn't get to do much in this movie but contribute essential plot information required to move the story along. The narrative line uses his character, Daffy, later in the story when Richard slowly becomes disillusioned on the island. This theme of action is effective and developed with strong emotional depth.

Once on the island, after discovering that a small potion is run by rigged drug farmers, Richard, Etienne and Francoise meet a secluded group of villagers who have permanently settled there, away from all the worlds' troubles. This picture perfect location is loosely led by a young woman named Sal (Tilda Swinton).

The island's beach is truly paradise. The atmosphere is beautifully luxuriant. The filmmakers choose the perfect location for this movie, creating the right visual style. Also contributing to the successful island concepts: the characters develop the place with colorful, momentum building dialogue and pleasant oral description. Because of these measures the writers take with the importance of creating a paradise island, our imaginations are nurtured to believe both internally and visually that this place is almost a heaven.

A conflict ""The Beach"" runs into is the attempt to fit too much material in one 119 minute movie. It tires to provide us with an illicit love story between the lustful Richard and the attractive Francoise. Thus Etienne provides us with some romantic competition. It also attempts providing us with a secret love affair between Richard and Sal, creating a villain, her boyfriend Bugs. We are also in an adventure film about the findings of drifters. The patrons also enters the mind of a young man whose mind becomes overtaken by his primal instincts. Also, the story about several young American travelers who behold a copy of a map to the island, threatening the native's existence. The plot with the foreign pot smugglers who murder people with assault rifles. We learn of the results of a shark attack and the pains the victims bring upon the group. The list goes on and on. If only the writers would have chosen a concrete subject and expanded on it rather than colliding a dozen different plots, we may have had a better movie.

I really enjoyed the visual style in ""The Beach"" that is militant and creative. It uses neat camera angles and cinematography to its advantage. Leonardo DiCaprio contributes to film's mood. He performs with the necessary dramatic tensions that fulfil narrative requirements, although his obvious narration ends up explaining much of the story to us.

Within the struggling situations of ""The Beach"" lay some very deserving potential. If only the filmmakers would have used the God given gift of imagination, something this movie lacks. In a picture half as good as ""The Beach,"" the destructive flaw would be found within the film's conflict, not the lack of conflict being the destructive flaw.

theBeach,Pretty,9/10,sonjanichols,6/3/2000,"This story explores the question, ""What is happiness?"" and although it doesn't really offer any new ideas (paradise isn't a place, it's a state of mind, etc.), it is still a fairly entertaining movie. The background is absolutely beautiful, and the idea of finding a secluded paradise community is intriguing. The soundtrack is even better than the movie.

theBeach,UGH! Zzzzzzzzz......,3/10,Chimera-5,12/2/2000,"Man, I can't believe they crammed all that boring hullabaloo into 2 hours! It seemed like an aeon! Did this movie remind anybody else of Fight Club (horrendous as well), as far as the narration and cinematography goes? What awful music throughout the whole movie too! I HATE POP MUSIC! Can no producer arrange for a score to be conducted these days??? Why do they always turn to MTV??? ::SPOILER:: When they chief thug says at the end ""If I cannot sell the dope, my family won't eat"", why would he not just sell a few million dollars worth from the get go so his family would be set for life???

theBeach,the beach,4/10,El' Oso,27/2/2000,"About this time last year I was given the novel ""The Beach"", by a close friend of mine, who told me it was a fantastic story. Personally, I didn't fancy it, but I did fancy the close friend, and decided to read it to please her. Well I have to say the book really was terrific, I read it in about two days and loved every minute of. Anyway I heard that Danny Boyle was making the film, and being a big fan of Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, I thought this is going to film of the year. Man was I wrong! First and fore most there was NO way Leo could have played ""Richard"" (he was English in the book),Secondly Francoise never looked twice at Richard in the book (but ten minutes into the film she's tearing wee Leo's shirt of) and the ending was pants (The ending in the book is superb).

Personally I feel that the story has been cut to ribbons, and had a top celeb (Leo) stuck in it to attract lots of money. Leo does his best, but sorry mate, you just shouldn't have been in it. Don't go and see the film if you have read the book, you'll be banging your head all night.",neg
theBeach,Waste of boyle and a great book,3/10,AniGuy,26/2/2000,"I was so disappointed by this film! I just finished reading the book which i simply loved. It really is an amazing book and not like the movie at all, so read it even if you didn't like the movie. Where was Jed? he was such a great character, and the love triangle? where was that pulled from???? I thought Leo was okay, but i was disappointed by him. despite his ""hot boy"" status he is a very good actor: basket ball diaries, what's eating gilbert grape etc. and he usually chooses good films to be in... at least more than a lot of those ""boys"". Danny Boyle as well really disappointed me. I love trainspotting and it's one of my fav. all around movies. its entertaining, original, funny, intellegent etc. etc. but his skills were lost on this film. it had no plot or purpose and lost all the feeling contained in the book. Read the book its a great ride...

theBeach,Just another pretty face,4/10,mary_mlp-2,22/2/2000,"Awful movie. We got free tickets and regret the time we lost sitting there ""suffering"" the movie for 2 hours. DiCaprio acting is awful, you cannot help to laugh at him during his ""dramatic"" scenes. The story simply gets lost in the beautiful landscape. Characters are not believable, you just have no idea what moves them. Too bad for Boyle since Trainspotting is one of my favorite movies.

theBeach,A waste of a great story.,3/10,Martin Jarborg,20/2/2000,"When I learned that they were going to make a film based on Garland's bestselling novel, I was slightly worried. When I then heard that DiCaprio was going to star, I became even more so. But I was still not prepared for the piece of crap that they had come up with. Lots of scenes have been taken out (for no apparent reason) and replaced with others (also for no apparent reason), leaving a messy, annoying and, at times, boring movie. I was very disappointed. If you've read the book - don't see the film, it's a waste of time. If you've seen the film but haven't read the book, please do so. Don't let the film put you off, it really is a great story.

The movie was very visually pleasing. I really got into it to the point where as I exited the theater I somehow expected to see sunny skies and palm trees surrounding me. But of course all I saw was a late night's sky and 4 foot high snow banks. This reality check was a real kick in the nuts.

theBeach,DAMP SQUIB,3/10,kevin c,21/2/2000,"This is a very poor and sometimes nasty little film. The 'beach' cult are all so selfish and wrapped up in themselves. And to be honest Leo is no better. Does he go native because of his guilt (shark victims), or because he's upset that he's going to be excluded? Leo's love interest has one of the lightest roles in recent female cinema history. And the ending where she e-mails the picture. It's as if she's had a lovely little holiday. Why didn't the farmers turn the guns on all of them?

theBeach,I'll take sand in my shorts over watching this mess again,4/10,Shiva-11,21/2/2000,"The Beach: Every backpacker is in search of untouched paradise, that one place that would make every postcard vendor salivate. Unfortunately, anyplace that remotely fits the bill is usually overrun with drunken revelers, package tourists and golden arches. When Richard, a jaded traveler, acquires a map with the location of a secret pristine beach he is determined to find it, regardless the risks. Which begs the question, what is the price of paradise?

Since Titanic Di Caprio has been damned, dismissed and denigrated. His detractors have obviously forgotten his performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Romeo and Juliet. Di Caprio deserves to be judged on his individual efforts and not prejudged for having been in a blockbuster. That said, he is horrible in this movie. Or to be more accurate, this film as a whole is terrible.

Beach attempts to be a fusion of Apocalypse Now and Lord of the Flies, only a lite version without the drama, irony, or introspection. The story is for the most part a sanitized, predictable muddled mess, except for the last 20 minutes, which are exceptionally outlandish -Richard's bouts with madness are laughable. The commune consists of a bunch of elitist spoiled brats who live in tense harmony with a band of pot growers (given that drug growing and smuggling are capital offences in Thailand I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time) until things go wrong. Big surprise. Finally, although the star of the movie is beautiful (I'm talking the beach here), it is not worth the price of admission.

I was expecting complete c**p and that is not what i got. I got an intelligent piece of filmmaking, Danny Boyle's second best film, Trainspotting being Number 1 of course. Is it a Masterpiece? Of Course not it has Leo Dio in it, but if you want to have fun for a few hours go see it, it can even be enlightening.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare Worthy,10/10,Acetylcholine,17/5/1999,"Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play. This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue. All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.). One of the best shakespeare adaptations in the multitude of which have entered the cinemas in the past few years.

RomeoJuliet,Beautiful Modernization of Shakespeare's Classic Play,9/10,starry-eyed_wanderer,1/4/2005,"The amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to re-do Shakespeare's famous tragedy in a modern setting while still retaining its original dialogue. What's even more amazing is it works. I admit that I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie, fearing that Luhrman had either destroyed the play's beauty and power by setting it in modern times, or had butchered Shakespeare's eloquent words by making them sound more modern. I was wrong. Almost everything about this movie is just incredible.

Luhrman brilliantly casted Claire Danes as fourteen-year-old Juliet. The actress certainly looks the part, with her youthful features and innocent eyes. More importantly, she acts the part. Ms. Danes almost flawlessly captures Juliet's distressing journey from childhood to womanhood, beautifully showing her dramatic transition which had taken toll on her during her five day relationship with Romeo. When the story begins, Juliet is a naive girl, having not yet experienced true love, and by the end we can clearly see just how much her love for Romeo has deepened in passion, and how dramatically her character has developed.

Leanardo DeCaprio's Romeo was almost equally impressive. Some of his recitations of Shakespeare made me cringe, but for the most part he was perfect. One of Romeo's most important characteristics in the play is the intensity of his emotions, and DeCaprio captures this feature incredibly. Romeo is brash and impulsive, with a tendency to act on the heat of the moment rather than to first consider the situation like the more levelheaded Juliet. This unfortunate characteristic, which played a huge role in leading up to the lovers' tragic fate, is wonderfully mastered by DeCaprio and retained throughout the film. But we also, like with Juliet, get a glimpse of his character's development. At the beginning of the play Romeo is a hopeless romantic who fantasizes of love, and seems to dwell more in his daydreamed world than actually on earth. At this point he has no idea what true love really is, he only thinks he does. It is not until he meets Juliet that he can begin to comprehend the true depth and passion of love. DeCaprio triumphs in this area as well.

The other actors are superb, and wonderfully portray their characters as Shakespeare intended. But what really impressed me was, as I stated earlier, the keeping of Shakespeare's original dialogue in Luhrman's modern setting. I know some people criticize this film for destroying the romance and beauty of Shakespeare's words by setting the story in modern day Verona, but I feel that it only made the film more romantic. What Luhrman did was both bold and brilliant, and he succeeded wonderfully.

I won't speak any more of the brilliance of this film, I just highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you're a fan of Shakespeare like me, I think you will enjoy this hip, yet still lovely, modernization of his most famous play ever.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Moderized Without Losing the Shakespeare,9/10,neon47,7/6/2005,"I'm a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their ""lives will pay the forfeit of the peace."" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that's because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven't seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you'll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who's who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo's best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I'd rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren't getting it, it's Romeo is the ""knight in shinning armor,"" Juliet is the angel of Romeo's dreams, and Romeo's best friend is the comic relief. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he's a villain). Both families you'll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you're a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It'll sweep you off you're feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"An eye-catching, starkly bold and breathtaking update of Shakespeare's greatest work.",10/10,Cherry-19,30/12/1999,"This film is incredible. Yes, the play is modernized, and for those who panned the film, I suppose originality was too much to take. Luhrmann stays with the original dialogue, which I believe adds much to the film and gives it authenticity. Therefore it cannot be dismissed as a masterpiece dumbed down to appeal to us easy to please teenagers. The camera work at the most dark parts of the film is quick and choppy, adding to the already potent and ever present depressing, tragic atmosphere. All of the leads were strong, with Danes and DiCaprio having amazing chemistry. In this film DiCaprio wasn't popular yet, so again critics can't say Leo was the draw for this film. Danes was emotionally pure and driven, and this is her best work to date aside from the critical darling, ""My So-Called Life."" No, the leads were cast with good reason - there couldn't have been any better. Supporting roles were wonderful, with the roles of Mercutio and Tybalt being exceptional, and the friar, who may be the most important character in the story, is brought to life by Postalwaithe The dreamy underwater shots are fantastic. Luhrmann's version of this classic tragedy plays to both a younger and older audience, adding touches such as the names of the guns being the names of swords; and he yet updates the setting, bringing the fantastic Verona, Italy to Verona Beach, Florida. A timeless story such as this makes any criticism of this film unnecessary and foolish; view it with an open mind and you will see the story as Shakespeare wrote it and as Luhrmann envisioned it.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare made sexy for the teen generation.,9/10,PizzicatoFishCrouch,17/8/2006,"Everyone is familiar with William Shakespeare's boy-meets-girl love story, and it has already been interpreted into films, plays, TV adaptations and songs. But Baz Luhrmann gives this world-known love story a modern-day twist, setting it in Verona Beach, and piling on the religious imagery. The result is quite spectacular.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes play the star-crossed lovers, and, whilst the latter is sadly a little bland, never truly convincing us in her portrayal of Juliet's loss of innocence or torment of feelings towards the foe, DiCaprio completely redeems her performance. He is a revelation. His Romeo is a wonderful mix of sad eloquence, a loving heart and a troubled soul, and all these elements come together beautifully in a performance hotter than a pepper sprout, with more layers than the proverbial onion. He is the very embodiment of sexy in his role. There is an extremely alluring way in which his character is filmed, which only enhances Romeo as a lover. This is epitomized in the opening shot of him, where the Leo is illuminated illustriously against the sunlight, and Radiohead's languid, sexy tune ""Talk Show Host"" plays.

The film itself has ""sexy"" written all over it, and, with the Gen X teenagers as his target audience, I don't think Luhrmann would have things any other way. But, unlike with that atrocity Moulin Rouge!, with Romeo + Juliet, the over-stylization is appropriate, making the movie more accessible to teens, for example, through gun warfare rather than swordplay, and the canny symbolisation of Queen Mab as a drug. But perhaps the most ingenious stylistic technique here is the slap-in-face Shakespearean references, which range from a ball called the Merchant of Venice, to 'Such stuff as dreams are made on' from The Tempest, making the film an absolute goldmine for trivia fans.

Style aside, there is more than enough substance. Romeo is presented exactly as the play does  at first, the mawkish, gawky, lovesick teenager, then, the fickle boy, and finally, the devoted and caring lover, and much of this loyalty to the play is due to the screenplay from Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, which maintains the original memorable dialogue and descriptions, but also dares to stray from the sidewalk in some of the plot turns, and the film completely benefits from it. The set designs are intricate and beautiful, and suit every frame of the film perfectly, and the icing on the cake is the music. Craig Armstrong's score for the swimming pool scene is as stunning as it is original, and the use of non-original music, from Kym Mazelle to The Cardigans, give the film the added edge of cool, making Romeo + Juliet one of the boldest, sassiest and most unforgettable adaptations to date, and English Lit. GCSE has been made far more digestible for us kids across England. It's what Shakespeare would have wanted. A-.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare that ANYONE can enjoy!,10/10,afreimann,26/9/2004,"I highly recommend this for those who find the reading of Shakespearean text difficult but have a desire to explore his masterful works. The modern-day setting and the brilliant dramatic interpretations rendered by the actors (all wonderfully cast, incidentally) transform Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece into a modern-day cinematic tour de force. DiCaprio and Danes are believably cast together (although Danes' natural conservatism is occasionally apparent, though not to any detrimental affect). Sorvino as Capulet is forceful, powerful,and immovable (just what this viewer believes Shakespeare probably had in mind as he penned the classic). Mercutio (Harold Perrineau Jr.) is powerfully moving in the entirety of his portrayal. This movie is visually mesmerizing. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and appreciation for excellent theatre.

RomeoJuliet,Excellent,10/10,ben-206-979423,7/1/2015,"It's a bit late to be reviewing this movie, but I find it an exceptional reboot. Everything about it is on permanent overdrive, as exemplified by the oversaturated setting and terse cinematography. Some people have reviewed this and expressed distaste at Harold Perinneau's portrayal of Mercutio in favour of the 1968 John McEnery. While ""de gustibus non est disputandum"" certainly applies here, I think it's worth pointing out that McEnery's performance brought a certain boorishness and abrasion to the character that Perrineau did not. Romeo, played by DiCaprio, was excellently cast and acted, striking a healthy balance between stunningly handsome and endearingly clumsy and exuberant. And I don't care what all you phonies say, Claire Danes was gorgeous.

Others have derided the film for certain choices made in the staging, combat, and/or nonverbal action, remarking ""Where did Shakespeare write that?"" Well. First, we are already working in a modern setting, so the assumption that historical accuracy in staging and direction should be followed to a T is frankly absurd. Second, the plays are public domain, which is a mixed blessing, as it brought us the 2013 R&J Sparknotes movie adaptation. But with that freedom comes a brilliant opportunity of artistic expression from the director, and each choice of omission or interaction in this production was apparently made with great care to maintain the integrity of the story being told.

To touch on comparisons between the 68 and 96 movies: don't try to tell me Leonard Whiting acted like he had any idea what he was saying. Have you people seen the movie?

This film is definitely worth your time. I find it to be a well-wrought revamping of one of my favourite plays from the Shakespeare Corpus.",pos
RomeoJuliet,To modernized,5/10,triple8,14/11/2003,"It wasn't that I hated this film but it certainly didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I don't understand what the purpose was of modernizing this story, especially the way it was done. While certain parts were mildly enjoyable and it was fascinating to see the early magnificense of Danes and Decaprio the movie made no lasting impression on me and some parts just-well they just didn't work.

It would be difficult for me to say exactly what didn't do it for me but I guess it just seems odd updating the story in this way. Great casting, great performances-but the movie left me flat.

I am not sure ""updating"" this movie was a GREAT idea. It was just a tee bit to modernized and though well intentioned was just off a bit. It didn't work quite like it should have. After the movie's done it's just sort of like your left with the feeling ""what was the point""",neg
RomeoJuliet,Beautiful,10/10,dee.reid,19/12/2000,"I just want to start by saying that I am a boy and I AM NOT A LEONARDO DICAPRIO FAN!

Now on with the review.

I'm 15. For my ninth grade english class, I am currently studying William Shakespeare's tragic play Romeo + Juliet in both modern and old english versions. Now I first heard about Romeo + Juliet back in fourth grade when I was 10 years old.

I didn't know what it was about at the time, so I asked my cousin (who was in ninth grade, but graduated in 1999) what it was about. She told me it was about two teenagers from two feuding families who meet and fall in love. They soon enough get married, but all that ends tragically when they commit suicide. As a result of their deaths, the two feuding families agree to peace.

Now I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater, so I patiently waited until it debuted on Cinemax a few months after it was released. Let me just say it was amazing! I had never seen a more beautiful film.

Baz Luhrmann's updated version of the play is absolutely stunning. What really surprised me about it was that it was set in present day Verona Beach, California. They drove around in cars, instead of riding on horses and instead of fighting with swords, they fight with guns. All of this was good. One thing surprised me though, it contained it's original dialogue. Now many films that are updates of the play, don't contain the original dialogue.

10/10",pos
RomeoJuliet,A horrible remake of a classic story,1/10,cbrinkm,17/2/2005,"I find it a shame that there is only one peer submitted review of this awful version of a classic play that has withstood the test of time. As such, I wish to give another view, as well as an opposing view to the only one on here.

Luhrmann may stay with the original dialog, but he plays fast and loose with the script. Anyone who has actually sat down and read the play as Shakespeare wrote it would know this. Example: Opening scene. In this ""version"" the Capulets are the targets of the Montague's insults. In the real version, this is reversed. A minor yet significant example, since in the original the reader has a small sympathy for the Montagues who are apparently just minding their own business when these idiots harass them. The names of the families on the guns to represent their ""swords"" is just ludicrous, not to mention the ""duel"" between DiCaprio and Tybalt. And yes, DiCaprio wasn't popular when this film was made, but that doesn't mean he did a good job at acting his part. He didn't. Nor did Claire Danes. They sounded like my 9th grade peers reading the text from their English book in total monologue. No emotion, no passion, no reason to listen to them, 'Nuff said.

And while we are on the subject of DiCaprio's reaction to Mercutio's death, why don't we talk about a little something known as ""Breaking the Tension,"" something that Luhrmann does better than anyone. During the famous scene where Romeo's best friend dies, we see perhaps the one and only time Leo shows true emotion to convey sorrow of losing his friend. Then we see the rage in his eyes as he swears revenge on his enemy. The pressure builds. We can feel the tension building up.

Then out of the blue Danes is singing a song and laying on her bed, leaving us to wonder what the heck just happened.

Do you see what has happened? We were all set, ready to see this dramatic scene unfold and climax, knowing its inevitable conclusion, we felt the blood rushing as we leaned forward on the edge of our seats, then we are smacked in the head with a sappy, lovely scene.

Anyone who knows anything about filmography knows that this completely breaks the tension that was building up. That is bad. It is bad because now the audience feels like it has been removed from the action, like waking up from a dream suddenly. After doing that, it is impossible to get back into the movie. And sure enough, we see Mr. Leo with a fixed look of anger and determination. We see him take out a scared Tybalt. But you know what? We don't care anymore, because we're still miffed about a moment ago when Luhrmann decided to throw us for a loop. We can't engage the moment anymore because we're now between two opposite feelings: One being the love Danes has for her Leo, and the hatred and anger Leo has for Tybalt. If Luhrmann had done this right, he would have had the entire scene with Romeo from the beginning to end (like Franco Zeffirelli did) and THEN put Danes bedroom scene in, AFTER the ""duel"" between protagonist and villain. This way, we would have felt the way Juliet does when she realizes something is wrong. We would have felt her world fall apart in front of her eyes when we were supposed to have done so: After the fight with Tybalt winds down and Romeo's rage is calmed.

And give me a break regarding the ""this movie is above criticism"" line. Even without all of its flaws (which, by the way, I have only touched some of the flaws in slight detail) ANY movie, ANY book, ANY play, ANY song, ANY piece of art that has, is or ever will be made for commercial use is open to criticism. Why? Because the author/artist/writer/etc. wants to be paid for their work. Now, if I am going to pay for something, I want the item in question to be quality. That goes for everything, including movies. I have only seen this movie in passing on the television, so I have not paid a penny for it. Nor will I.

And yes it is dumbed down for teenagers. Watching this version is like watching the vast majority of MTV music videos. They look visually pleasing, but that's to cover up the fact that the performers can't write good music. Same concept here.

In short, if you want a good Romeo and Juliet movie, this isn't it.",neg
RomeoJuliet,A Travesty,3/10,DumbBrunette,30/3/2006,"There are many kinds of films. There are the few truly magnificent ones that change us while never ceasing to lose our attention. There are also the mediocre, abounding and forgettable.

Then there are the films so ridiculous, so contrived, so terribly self-important that it forgets its purpose in the first place, that it forever marks our memories no matter how badly we may wish to forget it. This film just may be the crown jewel of that entire lot.

Everyone knows the story. Two star-crossed lovers who despite their passion can not seem to overcome the chains from the family feud that should divide them, and by weaving a web of lies and secrecy end up destroying themselves with it. It remains more or less unchanged in the movie, aside from needed adaptations to suit the new time period, but it simply does not work. The play itself is rather contrived. To expect an audience to see people in modern day falling into the same pitfalls as their Elizabethan counterparts did is insulting to their intelligence. The director and writer does not go to any lengths to attempt to make it seem possible either.

Characterizaton is also changed, but whether it was really the writing at fault remains to be seen. The lines are almost always taken directly from the play, but atrocious acting could easily have twisted it. It certainly exists in large amounts. By far and large, the cast is horrible, with extremely overrated and miscast Dicaprio and Danes at the helm. Both resort to overblown and soap operatic acting to convey the emotional turmoil of their characters, and neither do it well enough to merit anything but a laugh.

The film is nothing if not imaginative, however. The cinematography is gorgeous, and many shots whimsical, lavish, and inspired choices on the director's part. However, this distracts from the dark, morbid tone of the story, and rather than complement it, it only makes the film lose impact during the important scenes. The director also uses gratuitous shots of Christ and crosses and wide shots to emphasize drama, but only manages to come across as full of himself in a Neon Genesis Evangelion-esquire move.

The Breakdown: Cheesy, over-dramatic, with terrible acting to boot. Not even worth a rental unless you're in the mood for a good, long laugh.",neg
RomeoJuliet,brilliant,10/10,tazmaniac80,14/2/2003,"Yes, I am a teenage girl. Yes, i am a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's. But he and all of the cast give great performances, and make this a gem of a movie. It is incredibly moving, brings me to tears every time I watch it and always leaves me with a lump in my throat. It deserved to be high up in the Top 250, and I find it hard to critise anything about this film. It is definately worth watching, no matter what gender of age you are.

RomeoJuliet,Oh Please!! The 1968 version is a whole lot better than this crap!,1/10,emee4real,30/11/2007,"I can't believe there are people who actually like this version of Shakespeare's play. Or those who prefer it to the 1968 version. The producers who wished to make a ""modern-day"" Romeo & Juliet just failed woefully. Only Leonardo DiCaprio seemed to stand out with his portrayal of Romeo (and that's because he's such good actor); isn't it a surprise that his 1968 predecessor is also named Leonard (Whiting)? But let's face it: Claire Danes was so damned unconvincing as Juliet and very plain too. She is nowhere near the beautiful, talented Olivia Hussey, who wowed the audience with her performance as Juliet in 1968. No matter how you look at it, the part of Juliet doesn't fit her at all!

Also, in the 1968 adaptation, Michael York made me admire the Tybalt character, as he portrayed him with a cool and calm grace that nearly made Tybalt a likable character (even though we know he isn't). Unfortunately, John Leguizamo's Tybalt was so downright irritating and annoying that he made him a whole lot more unpleasant than Shakespeare himself did. There are several issues I find appalling in this flick. In the first place, who says that Tybalt beats up Romeo when Romeo initially declines to fight him? Because Shakespeare definitely didn't.

Secondly, when the bloke who plays Benvolio says ""Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do"", I'm like ""Swords? What swords? They are using GUNS, not swords"". Why doesn't he say: ""Hey! Put your guns down!""? That would have been more realistic.

Thirdly, Harold Perrineau's Mercutio, unlike that of John McEnery, is simply brash. He doesn't have the wit. And the idea of dressing him up like a drag queen is simply disgusting.

And finally, 4 crying out loud, who said Juliet woke up just before Romeo's death. Didn't the director read the story? I believe if Shakespeare got up from his grave and seen what they had done with his play, he'd call down GOD's curse on the script writers. In short, I was so disgusted with the movie that I wished I hadn't seen it at all. My brother who was watching it with me said he preferred it to the other one because it was ""modern"". He is one of those who believe that the movies made from the 80s backwards (i. e. movies of the 80s, 70s, 60s, etc) are rubbish, but that's his opinion, not mine.

Call me old-fashioned or whatever u like, but here's my verdict: If u are looking for a Romeo & Juliet movie, LOOK FOR THE 1968 ADAPTATION! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE, IT'S BLOODY TERRIBLE!!!",neg
RomeoJuliet,It's not for me! I just hated it!,1/10,Sylviastel,4/5/2006,"After only watching a few minutes of this adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, I couldn't take much more of it. It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it, so be it but not for me.",neg
RomeoJuliet,the most ridiculous version I have ever seen,2/10,broadwaystar402,12/2/2006,"This is the worst, albeit most hilarious version of any Shakespearean play I have ever seen. It was simply ridiculous, and although it was intended to be a tragedy, this movie is not. Unless you consider bad movies ""tradgedies"".

Leonardo DiCaprio was mediocre as Romeo, although Claire Danes was good in the role of Juliet. There were several points in which it moved from tragic and poignant to stupid and absurd. One such time was when Romeo is driving down the street before he kills Tybalt, he is screaming as if possessed. This was a bit over-done. There are others, such as the over-dramatized and misinterpreted scene towards the end, where Romeo is about to drink the poison. Juliet opens her eyes and reaches her hand up towards him, while he continues talking, completely oblivious!!! Where, may I ask, is that in the original play?!

I guess I am just another traditionalist, and I acknowledge that Baz Luhrmann has a right to his own interpretation, and that there are those that truly enjoyed this movie. However, I honestly believe that Shakespeare would be appalled at how his brilliant and incredible works have been adapted to the silver screen.",neg
RomeoJuliet,No,1/10,MidnightWarrior,26/12/2005,"Do not see this film. I remember watching it years ago and thinking how could have one of Shakespeare's greatest works been butchered on screen? This is not avant-garde cinema; it's much worse than any experimental cinema that I've ever seen.

For starters, the music and hip-hop of this film ruin it completely. The dirty sets and shoddy costumes of the actors make this film look like the cast and crew live in selective dumpsters. The acting was best reserved for a kiddie, amateur play.

Overall, this film is proof why people on hallucinogens and narcotics should not be using when making films.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Unwatchable trash,1/10,No.6,30/6/1999,"Fans of Shakespeare and good movies stay clear. This is possibly the worst movie ever made. First off the camera zooms in and out so much you can't tell what's going on, and it's enough to give one motion sickness. This ruins the movie by itself. Second, they do a freeze frame of each actor to introduce each character ala The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. A Sergio Leone movie this is not. Third, the acting is incredibly awful. Pete Postlethwaite is basically the only competent actor. The cameo by M. Emmet Walsh is blasphemous. Everyone else deserves to be in this lemon of a movie. Fourth, there is a music number that made me want to end it all right then and there. However, this movie has one thing going for it. The script. It was basically unadapted from the play, however, the way it was visually handled is enough to make Shakespeare roll over in his grave. And over and over and over...

RomeoJuliet,Rent or buy Zeffirelli's 1968 version rather than waste your money on this garbage,1/10,boethius-1,30/10/2001,"Luhrmann's unoriginal reworking of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (the American youth gang scenario had been used many times before, once on film and over a dozen times on the stage) is a shallow experience, devoid of soul, with a feeble performance by Leonardo di Caprio. On every level, it fails. If you want to see a truly great interpretation of this classic, watch Zeffirelli's inspired and stunning 1968 version.

RomeoJuliet,The best version of Romeo & Juliet I've seen - brilliant!,9/10,chellekat,24/1/2002,"I think the best thing about this movie is that it brought Shakespeare to millions of people who would never have normally appreciated it. When Baz made this movie he didn't want to make yet another 'boring' drama that would turn people off - more long dresses and men in tights? How many times did we sit through these movies in high school studying for our next English exam? Big yawn!

Instead, he took the story and threw it into modern times, cast fresh young actors, gave it a modern soundtrack and directed a masterpiece. The story otherwise remains exactly the same, word for word. Most of the kids who saw this don't even realise they've just had an English lesson by the end of the movie! Hey, knock it if you like but I think anything that might get more people reading or appreciating the written word can't be that bad.

Highly entertaining, a heartbreaking romance, and a visual feast, Romeo + Juliet is a movie I've treated myself to at least once a year since I first saw it in '96. After seeing Moulin Rouge this year I watched it twice in a row. A must for any romantics - just keep an open mind and expect the unexpected if you've never seen a Baz Luhrmann film before - you either love or you hate this hopeless romantic but you should at least appreciate what he does.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Very surprisingly very good,8/10,leighwill,23/1/2001,"It shouldn't work but somehow it manages to. Most people assume the play will survive an update because it is 'timeless' or 'as relevant now as ever' but that is the reason why modernizing it should be doomed to failure. It's not really saying anything that hasn't already been said. It has almost become a cliché that the theme of the play is as relevant today as it was when it was written. What Baz Luhrmann does is bring something a little different to the story it's bold but that's why it's good. Modern elements are blended almost seamlessly in to the original script. The TV Anchorwoman replaces the narrator, gun play replaces sword play, Verona beach replaces the city of Verona, gang violence replaces family rivalries and other elements like the taking of hallucinogenic drugs and the drag act appear convincingly with the original dialogue as if they were always meant to be there.

Keeping the original script was essential since it is written poetically (people in Shakspeare's time didn't really talk like that) and no one in there right mind would change the words of a poem since that would defy the whole point of it. If the language of the play puts you off watching this I would seriously recommend reading it first to help your understanding. A little bit more work than your average shallow Hollywood money spinner but infinitely more rewarding.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Don't see it,1/10,Elanor000,26/3/2006,"Romeo and Juliet... a great story, yes? Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo? Um... no. Overall this is a particularly awful version. First of all, the Elizabethan dialect in the modern setting distracts horribly from the storyline. To see a man with pink hair in a half-open Hawaiian shirt saying thee and thou and other such nonsense is generally not pleasing to the modern audience. In addition, if you didn't know the story, you'd be extremely confused. There are some, well, not plot holes, but very confusing sections. In general the movie shows almost no traces of the fact that the Capulets and the Montagues hate each other. Furthermore several completely unnecessary (and rather disgusting) additions have been made, including a cross-dressing Mercutio. The ""prince of cats"" title attributed to Tybalt is atrociously overdone - he hisses at people. So if you want to see a great version of this classic story, see the 1968 version with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey - a much more satisfying movie.",neg
RomeoJuliet,There's just no pleasing some people,10/10,chris_teasdale,17/3/2018,"This is less of a review and more of a response to others. I will keep it short and sweet. There seems to be a lot of people upset that this movie doesn't stick to the original script exactly. In other words, read the play line for line. And what an absurd waste of time that would be. If I want to see the play, I will go to the theatre and see the actual play. When you go to the movies you expect something different. Not necessarily better. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a movie version set in the present day will be different. However, I know for a fact that even if the play had been copied line for line, some people would still not be happy about that. As I found out from someone's review of 'much ado about nothing' by joss whedon. Hence the title of my review. Some people just love to complain no matter what. I for one have always liked this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.

RomeoJuliet,"Leo does Shakespeare. Oh, goody.",1/10,nutz4n64,28/1/2000,"I was first introduced to Shakespeare freshman year at high school. Sure, it was a bit tough at first, but I got used to it. Romeo and Juliet was a terrific play. Then came the time in class when we would watch the video adaptations of this play. We spent half the period on the '68 version, then half on this one, which went on for a few days. The '68 version was very well done, and most of the class liked it. Then we watched the ""new"" one. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it might be good. Then I see the Montagues cruising the expressway in an open top convertable. OK, so it's in modern times. It might be good. Then I heard them speak. Dear God, what were they thinking?!

I see this fight at a gas station where everyone looks like they're on speed and they shout these Shakespearean lines like they're normal for the time. I should've seen it coming when, instead of a narrator, a news caster does the prologue. Great job. Tip to the writers: if you're going to put Shakespeare in modern times, don't include the original lines. ""Draw the sword!"" What ""sword?"" I saw no sword in the movie. I saw some guns. Is this what Shakepeare would call guns nowadays? And do I see news reports and beach parties where people actually speak in blank verse? And let's not forget Leonardo DeCaprio. How much more pathetic can his acting get? I hardly saw any good actors in this movie. I don't know why people would see this as ""good"" entertainment. Rarely do I ever give a 1 out of 10 to any movie, but this was just plain garbage. If you want to see the real Romeo and Juliet, watch the '68 adaptation. It is much more worthy to be called a work of Shakespeare's.",neg
RomeoJuliet,This movie is a mutt,1/10,ti-cat,8/8/2004,"If you want to see Romeo and Juliet on film, watch the 1968 version. Olivia Hussey is gorgeous, John McEnery is a great Mercutio and the Nino Rota music is magnificent. You can even see young Michael York, who plays a brilliant Tybalt.

This version had me alternating between boredom and anger. I found it pompous and cartoonish. The overall impression was of a sophomore's first attempt at film. Call me old fashioned, but if a director interprets one of the finest theatrical works in the English language, it seems to me that he needs to do a better job than this.

Harold Perrineau did a decent job at Mercutio in the context of a film that just doesn't get it done. Too bad that some pretty good acting talent was wasted on this weak project. Rate this a 1.

RomeoJuliet,what a waste of celluloid,1/10,lhaney,16/9/2000,"this film takes the bounds of the unwatchable and stretches them to near-mythic proportions. how a director could start with a play of such stature and end up with such a poorly acted, unintelligibly edited piece of filth is beyond my comprehension. the only thing this flick has going for it is the supporting cast. Pete Postlethwaite is excellent, as always, but putting him on screen with leo's befuddled romeo is a true crime. some modernizations are better left unmade. on the whole, i'd rather sit in the treatment chair in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and be forced to watch ""West Side Story"" for three days straight than be forced to endure a second watching of of this beast.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare would roll in his grave!,1/10,RafiSteinger,4/11/2007,"This movie was not only pathetic, but a mockery of theater in general. West Side Story is an adaptation of the original story - and did well in theaters. This however, was nothing more than unoriginal work with special effects and catchy music riffs selling unnecessary bad-taste to suburban white kids with access to mommy and daddy's credit. When this movie came out - the ""teen generation"" ate it up - and Hollywood cashed in on it's success; regardless of the fact that this feature had no depth, class, or innovation. It was simply the same dialogue and setting of Shakespeare's original, with enough polish on it to get everyone to want to buy a piece. Shakespeare had a beautiful vision - this wasn't it.

RomeoJuliet,A failure,1/10,aya862001,28/2/2004,"This modern version of Romeo and Juliet was actually the most foolish one I have ever seen. The director depended on choosing popular actors and forgot about everything else. I think that his fatal mistake was choosing the setting of the movie to be in modern times. If he had decided that the script would go unchanged and retain the same events as the original play, then he might as well have preserved the setting. Yet he didn't and at the end everything was messed up. It is quite apparent that the problems that faced Romeo and Juliet cease to exist in modern times. First of all Romeo and Juliet come from extremely rich families, when they realized they were in love, couldn't just go to another Italian city or even buy two two hundred dollars plane tickets to Spain and forget about their families. The film just doesn't present anything contra that solution. Maybe in the older days, some five hundred years ago, girls in Europe couldn't walk out easily out of their family's house, but I presume that his is not the case nowadays. Even if we made the hypothesis that Romeo and Juliet weren't ""that smart"", or if Juliet's family was the only traditional family in Europe and the events went on in the same sequence, when Romeo was banished couldn't she just go visit him like his church friend did and tell him about her plan?With all those up to date communication devices was the DHL the only choice to report such vital news? Also this banishment in a desert thing seems so stupid. Europe no longer applies this punishment and if it did, it wouldn't be free from security. They prevent people to walk out from cinemas at the middle of films, don't they have the ability to prevent people form walking out of their exiles. And this herbal 24 hour poison that Juliet had taken to make her seem dead, can it actually fool modern day medicine. Would they just take a person who seems breathless and bury him without carefully examining him. What makes matters worse is that she is presented as the daughter of one of the most powerful families, I mean; she should have been examined properly. As stupid as well was the loud monologue Juliet used to make to herself. Mad people are the only ones who talk to themselves. The director could have just transformed such loud quotations into thoughts. Maybe at the time of Shakespeare they didn't have that option, but now they certainly do. As I formerly mentioned mainly I am against the time setting of the film, because the world has changed a lot. But there are other things that were inappropriate for example the people who screamed at each other while holding guns. All I can say is that it is badly done movie. Too little effort was exerted to make it. It took away two sixteenth century family and put them in the inappropriate time and the result was devastating. Everything seemed freaky. The concept behind the Romeo and Juliet tragedy was not conveyed to me through that movie because everything seemed illogical. It certainly was a failure.",neg
RomeoJuliet,MTV meets Shakespeare,8/10,preppy-3,1/7/2002,"Updating of ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the 1990s. I'm going to skip a synopsis of the plot--everyone knows it.

This is basically ""Romeo and Juliet"" in modern day dress full of arresting visuals, gunplay, loud 1990s music, wild dance numbers with all the cast members using Shakespeare's original dialogue! The effect is odd (to say the least). It ALMOST works. The visuals are all incredible (director Buz Luhrmann always knows how to make a film look fantastic) and the movie almost never stops for a breath. That's the problem--at first it's fun, but after 2 hours you're exhausted. Also the actors seem lost. When they're talking Shakespeare they seem to have no idea what they're saying. Most of them just recite the lines with a blank look on their faces. The older actors (Paul Sorvino especially) are much better at it. The casting and acting in this is all over the place.

Leonardo DiCaprio (as Romeo) is a good actor, but he's just all wrong for this role. He looks lost and way out of his depth. However, Claire Danes is wonderful as Juliet. Very sweet, likable and seems to have a clear understanding of the dialogue. Also her reactions in her dancing scene with Paris are hilarious. John Leguizamo is way over the top as Tybalt--too much. He quickly becomes annoying. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino are very good as Montague and Capulet but are underused. Even Paul Rudd is very good (and incredibly handsome) as Paris. He seems to be having a whale of a time in his role.

Also, there is an incredible party sequence and Romeo's cousin comes in a wig, dress and lipstick and no one bats an eyelash. There's a great musical number on a huge staircase also.

Loud, eye-popping, funny and even quite moving. As it stands, I'm giving it an 8. With a better cast I might give it a 10.

Best line: ""Check on me tomorrow and you'll find me a grave man.""",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Two households, both alike in stupidity...",1/10,gierran,8/11/2003,"Shakespeare for stupid people. Many people, Americans mostly, are terrified of Shakespeare. They feel that they aren't smart enough for it. They panic over the language, not understanding that if they can't hear or ""get"" what is being said, it's time to blame the actors. Then there are the people who, by wasting their educations, really are that ignorant. So, the makers of this film, decided to dumb the whole thing down instead of investing the movie with a certain level of intelligence. Incompetent trash. If you took brightly colored, glittery wrapping paper and rubbed it into your eyes you'd get the same effect.

RomeoJuliet,Hated it,1/10,colonelmonkey,12/12/2005,"This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I didn't like how it was only partially modernized, and the actors couldn't act for soup. Basically it reeked of stupidity.

With Shakespeare, you either have to modernize the whole thing, or not modernize it at all. The combination of a modern setting and the original text didn't work. It was awkward and hard to follow.

The actors didn't seem like the poetic sort. Half the time, Benvolio was shirtless and reciting poetry. None of them had any idea how to read Shakespeare. It was hard to appreciate the text when the actors were completely lacking in realistic feeling. I think that two directors made a bet to see who could make the worst movie with the most highly paid actors. Baz Luhrmann most definitely won.

The whole thing reeked of stupidity, to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. I was extremely annoyed with the subtitles explaining who the people were, as if we didn't already know. The frequent freezes on the ""swords"" and ""daggers"" were totally pointless and wasted time.

In conclusion, I think you would have been better off watching the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet, which was classy and very accurate to the actual text. I would rather have my fingernails torn out with white hot nail clippers than be subjected again in my life to this horrible mess of badly modernized plot lines, butchered text, and shoddy actors. Out of 5 stars I give it a negative 7.

RomeoJuliet,"Modernized Shakespeare? Good Intent, Terrible Movie",1/10,jimkahl,3/3/2000,"I have long been a fan of Shakespeare. It has always amazed me that a person could write an entire play as a series of poems. The man was a genius. Modernizing Shakespeare for the teens of today is a good idea - but this movie falls terribly short.

After seeing this movie (I can't believe I watched the whole thing - I guess I thought it would get better), I was thoroughly disgusted. There are several reasons. First, the acting itself was terrible, except for John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who did a magnificent job. Leo and Claire both seemed as though they were reading most of their lines from cue cards - there was little if any emotion involved. This movie also destroyed the true relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, it turns Romeo into a druggie and Mercutio into nothing more than his dealer. What kid of today who uses drugs would seek revenge for the death of his dealer? None. They would simply seek out a different one. I can understand trying to remain true to Shakespeare's words, however, there were many times in the movie that doing so did not make sense.

This movie would probably have been much better if it had not used Shakespeare's dialog. The cast itself isn't bad, but for the most part they did not seem comfortable with the original dialog. If they would have modernized the dialog along with the visual aspects, I might have enjoyed it more.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Luhrmann creates an overly-elaborate slaughtering of Shakespeare's eloquence,3/10,lukesmith4887,11/4/2010,"In Romeo+Juliet, director/producer Baz Luhrmann takes the traditional story of ""two star-crossed lovers,"" puts it in Verona Beach in about 1970, adds his own little motif of water, over-dramatises the whole story, chooses substandard performers, and to top it all, ignores half of Shakespeare's original text.

In one of the first few scenes, through the chosen costumes, Luhrmann takes what was to some extent implied in the text, and makes Mercutio a transvestite homosexual, Tybalt a devil, and, using blatant stereotypes, Juliet becomes an angel, and Romeo a knight-in-shining- armour. Some might call this ""rather cute,"" I call it lack of imagination.

It seems that, however much he tried, Luhrmann could not succeed by himself, and so tried to find people to be successful for him: Leonardo DiCaprio, for example. DiCaprio was one of the small number of cast members who did a half decent job at their role. DiCaprio quite effectually portrayed the romantic, bashful, teenage Romeo, giving the viewer at least some feeling of verisimilitude. Claire Danes, however, removes this feeling by giving Juliet the image of forced emotion. Also, Luhrmann's casting of Miriam Margoyles, using a somewhat Spanish accent, as the Nurse gives a completely different image of the bawdy Nurse that Shakespeare portrayed. Luhrmann avoids the bawdiness by simply skipping over most of those parts of the original text.

The Nurse's suggestive monologues are not the only sections of the text that Luhrmann skips; he also takes out many side plots and events that occur throughout, apparently without realising that some of them do have some import in the story. For example, in the film, Romeo never kills Paris, who, in the text, is yet another one of the innocent victims of the family feud. This may not have a huge effect, but when there are a number of similarly small events taken out, the effects add up, making what is an excellently written story into something much less powerful.

One might think that, having not done too great a job in other aspects, Luhrmann might have done better on his choice of music. Then one notices that music varying from artists such as Garbage, to One Inch Punch, to the Butthole Surfers, can be summarised, quite simply, as melodramatic rubbish. Quite fitting, considering Luhrmann's apparent love of melodrama, as shown through his choices of casting, costume, setting, and music. And that more or less summarises the whole movie: an over-done butchering of Shakespeare's beautiful writing.",neg
RomeoJuliet,my pick for the all time worst,1/10,tommyson,27/1/1999,"This movie should have never been made. The idea to modernize ""Romeo & Juliet"" isn't that bad, but the idea to give the Shakespeare style laungue is, so bad in fact, it made me laugh. The classic scenes are re-done and the music is punk crap. If you want a good adaption rent the 1968 version and skip this junk.

RomeoJuliet,a retarded reinterpretation,3/10,Sam_Gray,23/2/2000,"Sigh. I generally dislike movies that attempt to set classics in modern times, and this is no exception. Not only is this version of the play difficult to take seriously, it's paced badly, and most of the acting is terrible. What Luhrmann has attempted to do is splice hyperactivity together with intellect - and the two don't mix well. Furthermore, setting Romeo and Juliet in modern times necessarily takes the play entirely out of context, especially when using the original dialogue. Romeo and Mercutio are particularly misrepresented here.

There are only two things that keep this ""film"" from getting a one or a two from me. First, the soundtrack is cool (I'm a huge Radiohead fan). Second, Shakespeare's writing is still genius, even in a misrepresentation like this. But otherwise, there's little to like about this movie. It's a blatant and gross exploitation of art for the sake of trendiness. 3/10

RomeoJuliet,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VER EVER SEEN!!!!,1/10,TheyKilledTheGiggler,10/6/2002,"I hated this movie not just because it was based on shakespeare's play but because the acting and the camera direction was so stupid. This movie is so dumb it make ""Leprechaun In the Hood"" seem like an oscar caliber film. I would not watch this movie again if someone paid me. I just hope there is never a movie like this again

RomeoJuliet,Hilarious,1/10,MarioB,10/9/1999,"Hi, kids! Tired of litterature and theatre? Tired of these classic lessons in school? Watch this: like you, Hollywood goes ape about the Renaissance crap! Here we have images like in MTV! We had lousy music, camera movements (8 in 2 seconds) we had two very beautiful young stars and we have the very true American way: guns and knifes! And everybody's talkin' like in the original Shakespeare! Oh yeah! He's the guy behind that : Billy Shakespeare, a cool rapper! Once in a mouth, my girlfriend and I rent an American movie that the critics hate to see how bad the film was, in our opinions. We saw Twister, Armageddon, Godzilla, Independance day, but we have to admit that this Romeo + Juliet beat them all! We laugh every single minute of it! This is unbelievable crap! In 50 years, young people will rent this movie in the same way we watch today Plan Nine From Outer Space.

RomeoJuliet,Doomed for failure,1/10,hippiedestroyer,31/7/2001,"Probably one of the worst remakes of all time. Not only is Bazz Luhrman a horrible director who shoots in this new ""trendy"" fast cut, music video style, but he has a bad vision. He tried to make the whole thing so trendy and hip by affiliating gangs, and such, but it doesn't work and comes out pretty campy.

This movie sold well to little girls who like Leo Dicaprio, but no true fan of literature or cinema for that matter would like it.

RomeoJuliet,"Visually stunning, but this could have been better",5/10,TheLittleSongbird,14/4/2010,"Now I like Baz Luhrmann, I loved Moulin Rouge! and Australia was a much better film than people give credit for. However, I was disappointed with this version of Romeo and Juliet. I really liked the 1968 film with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey though that did have one or two problems.

Starting with the redeeming qualities, the film does look amazing. The cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous. I also liked how the Capulet party was staged, all grand and lavish and Claire Danes's white swan dress was stunning. Harold Perrineau was perfect as Mercutio yes the singing wasn't great but it was for comedy, and Pete Postlethwaite was a noble and sympathetic Friar Lawrence. Miriam Margoyles is a fine actress and brought a real sense of maternal instinct to the role of Juliet's nurse. Regarding the character though, she could have been developed more, seeing as she was the main source of motherly affection in the play I would have liked to have seen that come across more. Also I would have liked to have seen more of Paris, a smaller role but a significant one. And Leonardo Di Caprio does have a boyish charm that compensates for any thoughts of whether he was too young. I liked how fast it moved too, it was almost exhilarating in pace, and I think the film makers did that purposefully to empathise how rushed Romeo and Juliet's relationship was. Plus the ending is very tragic as it should be.

However, there are other aspects that didn't quite work. I have no problem with a film that is updated, it worked in West Side Story, it worked in Carmen Jones, but it does feel jarring when the script is not modernised, with a poetic and archaic sounding script mixed by exhilarating non-stop action merging on screen it doesn't quite work. Plus when Benvolio says ""Put up your swords"" I personally felt ""put down your guns""(as they were guns not swords here) would have been better. Baz Luhrmann's direction was also a disappointment, sometimes in the early scenes it was so over the top that I forgot I was watching a version of Romeo and Juliet and thought I was watching a flash cartoon. (I love animation don't get me wrong but that feel to this film doesn't bode well with me). The soundtrack I had mixed feelings about. I liked the music at the beginning and in the balcony scene, I liked the use of Mozart's Symphony Number 25 and I liked the use of Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde sung brilliantly by Leontyne Price, however some of the more contemporary songs felt somewhat intrusive. Claire Danes looked gorgeous, but her acting was rather unconvincing in places, her crying for instance felt very melodramatic and (please don't take this the wrong way) reminded me of a spoilt rich girl who cried when she didn't get her way. Finally, I have nothing personal against John Leguizamo though I am not fond of him either, but I thought he badly overdid the character of Tybalt, too much of the tough guy attitude and not enough of the grace and coolness of the Tybalt of the play and the 1968 version.

Overall, watchable but disappointing. It could be worse though, you could be watching that animated film with seals taking the roles of the Shakespearean characters, that did a much worse job at respecting(more like disrespecting) the material. 5/10 Bethany Cox",neg
RomeoJuliet,"An Overrated piece of trash, *1/2 out of ****",1/10,Idocamstuf,14/2/2003,"I have avoided this movie for quite a while now, but after watching it I wished I had avoided it forever!!! First of all to add a pop atmosphere and music was a big mistake, because it didn't work at all. Second of all the acting was awful, especially DiCaprio who looked like a student reading out of a boring textbook. Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehy who I think are both great actors were wasted in cameos, as was John Leguiziamo. I'm glad Claire Danes' career shattered because she is a pretty bad actress, although she's not bad to look at. Overall I think this movie was a piece of trash and would never watch it again. *1/2 out of ****

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare debased,1/10,johnhobson,10/3/2000,"I have no problem with updated versions of Shakespeare. When I was in college, I was in a production of Merchant of Venice set in the 19th century; and I liked what Kenneth Branaugh did with his 19th century Hamlet. I once saw Coriolanus set in the Confederacy during the US Civil war -- which added quite a bit to the political dimensions of the play.

However, this one is over the top. When we see ""Sword"" brand handguns -- obviously so the line ""put up your sword"" would make sense -- and having Mercutio be a drug dealer is simply too much.

Nevertheless, I could have lived with it, except for two things: Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Neither one of these two has a clue about how to speak Shakespearian English. See DiCaprio with Peter Postlethwaite (Friar Laurence) or Danes with Miriam Margolyes (Nurse). Both Postlethwaite and Margolyes know the music of Shakespeare, and it is almost painful to see DiCaprio and Danes stumbling. And putting the balcony scene in a swimming pool is simply stupid.

Also, some of the secondary characters are badly done. John Leguizamo is a terrible Tybalt, and the limp-wristed Mercutio is ludicrous. Bryan Dennehy is simply wasted as Montague.

And I would like to inform the script-writer that Juliet wakes up AFTER Romeo dies, not before. If this were my introduction to Shakespeare, I would avoid him like the proverbial plague.",neg
RomeoJuliet,A curse on both your houses!,8/10,Mike_the_Critic,17/6/2005,"Wow, this was an awesome movie! and no I did not just see it, i saw it again. If I can only have swords like these boys do.

From beginning to end this movie grips you and breathes new modern (and socially understandable) language into this film. Sure the words are the same, but there is so much of a difference from reading the book and watching this movie. In the book, it is dull and just seems to overflow with so much crud that is going on. I wish I was back in time watching these plays. The movie puts it all into perspective. Because the book is not descriptive 100 per cent, it is all language. Yeah yeah use my imagination to envision it, but I rather experience another's vision. Their vision might be totally something I would not expect, and it was. This movie was beautiful in images as it was in words. Hell it was all the director had to do because he had all the words already beautifully crafted for him. The interaction between characters was wonderfully displayed. The movie literally jumped out and grabbed my attention. come one gun wielding wild men from opposing sides screaming at each other death threats. How is this not entertaining. Hell how many American's watched the war in Iraq on CNN. This interests us. Whoever casted Mercutio was bloody brilliant. The whole before the ball scene, and the body language was just amazing. His death was something that always makes me love. Not because he died, but because of how it all played out. It was just sheer raw emotion.

The story itself I just pity. Not because it sucks, but the subject matter. Makes me think about love and if it is even worth it. When you see a timeless movie that does not end your way you think about what you would have done. I myself would not change anything, but I am just sad that an honest and true love died. Does it exist in this world? Who knows.. All I know is, I wanted to be Romeo just to be with Juliet! I will safely say this is the best transition from book to big screen I have ever seen..although Sin City was amazing. I wish this movie was easily available when I was in High school studying this play.

Amazing Movie...",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Visuals, music & dialogue unparallelled ...",9/10,Spam-4,23/8/2015,"An excellent production of the play, it captures the energy and frustration of its mostly young protagonists and is visually and musically stunning as others have observed. The original dialogue is slotted into the modern context with skill and humour and the characters of Mercutio & Tybalt are especially well wrought.

== spoiler ==

What disappoints me is the unnecessary lack of cohesion. When the prince says in conclusion that ""all are punished"" we don't understand that the slain Mercutio is his kinsman, as is Paris (whom Romeo kills at the tomb in the text), nor do we get the subtleties of the timing & messaging cock-ups to do with Juliet's arranged marriage and her 'suicide'.",pos
RomeoJuliet,An abomination,4/10,Blake_Petit,30/3/1999,"William Shakespeare is turning cartwheels in his grave. There are good ""updates of Shakespeare..."" ""West Side Story"" and ""Forbidden Planet..."" and then there are films like THIS. Taking Shakespeare's script and plopping it into modern-day Los Angeles was the worst way to translate Shakespeare I've ever seen. I can only hope that this movie serves as a constant reminder that when things aren't broken, they shouldn't be fixed.

RomeoJuliet,Genius,10/10,chrisfoster99,4/7/2005,"I was forced to read Romeo and Juliet in school over 20 years ago and didn't really ""get it"".

I have latterly learnt to appreciate Mr S for his plays etc. etc.

My 8 yr old daughter and I watched this tonight. She didn't understand much of the language, although remembering the lessons from school I could explain the double meanings etc. etc. in the script.

The upshot was that I enjoyed a stylish, colourful and thoughtful filming of a 400 year old script and my daughter very much enjoyed Bill's wonderfully scripted masterpiece. To my surprise, after the first hour she had begun to understand the slightly topsy turvy language of our past and understood some of the subtleties in the plot.

Thank you Mr Luhrmann.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Amazing Actors BUT..,1/10,momma_mia_fasho,19/3/2006,"I've seen and done this play so many times and they ruined it for me. Their(Leo and Claire's) wording and pauses were all messed up. It sounded and looked as if they didn't even know what they were saying(most of the time). Very little times did it seem convincing. I think they are both amazing actors but this just wasn't their best.. BY FAR.. I think the supporting roles upstaged the two main actors.. Why out of the whole cast the 2 Main Characters seem the most out of place.. I am younger then most of you BUT I was mostly trained as a Shakespearian actor and my JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL version was much better. Unless it was a scene where they were mad and crying it wasn't very convincing..

RomeoJuliet,"Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly Artificial",1/10,veranjank,14/2/2003,"Romeo+Juliet (1996)

Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly Artificial

It is rarely that one comes across this kind of joke, and that is a patronizing statement. This film should be branded as a transmogrification of a gem. Now one would be compelled to compare this movie with Moulin Rouge, the director's more recent, much acclaimed, over rated, effort. In that case, too, he brought the 1950's classic tragedy down to a messy soup. I was inclined to put the technique to the surrealist genre, and now I think that I was being too generous.

But Romeo+Juliet really hits the rock bottom. The drama, transported some five centuries forward, and the whole drama played out of context (the characters, including the TV newsreader, speaking in the archaic language) was funny, to say the least. And, in the maze of modern gadgetry, Juliet's mansion (or any other mansion or shop for that matter) not to have a simple telephone was definitely going too much. This kind of love that cannot spare a few dollars for a cellular phone (and paying for such miserly conduct with death) is unimaginable. I do not think that anyone who is not mesmerised by DiCaprio could in any manner relate to any of the characters or sympathise with them; they are so artificial.

Leaving aside Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) that was an orthodox version (and quite memorable too), one remembers with much affection The Westside Story, a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. There the modern social elements were interwoven into the setting so that the result was a recreation of the spirit of the original Romeo and Juliet. I believe even Shakespeare would not have found fault with that.

The only remarkable aspect of this Romeo+Juliet was music. However, a bad concept has never been resurrected by good music.

I only hope that the director would stop desecrating milestones of the past.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Terrible to say the very least.,2/10,markocricket-1,16/3/2008,"I recently watched this version of Romeo And Juliet. Great movies such as: The Godfather, Goodfellas and many other great films make you think after them. But this film stuffs romance drama down your throat until you can't breath.

The fact that in this film of thugs speaking in Shakespearean language makes you think the worlds culture is better than what it is. The world of English speaking people don't speak in the old English. I found it severely annoying to find Paul Sorvino (who's played Paul Vario also known as Paul Cicero. ) acting like an idiot. Although rather clever input of the movie.

The fact that in the film they had ""pimped"" up cars. It's not as if in the story they had horses with swords as hoofs. They are the reasons I didn't rate Romeo And Juliet much.",neg
RomeoJuliet,A good movie with some minor flaws,7/10,Smells_Like_Cheese,26/10/2002,"Well, this is the MTV version of Romeo and Juliet. I honestly really can't stand Claire Daine's acting. I think she really sucks. But over all, her and Leonardo do heat up the scenes. There were some things I questioned about. Like the fight scene between Mercutio and Tybolt. Their fight was supposed to be playful like. Not all over dramatic. Not till the end is it supposed to be dramatic.

They didn't really get into the Paris's character. And I didn't really feel the effect of the prince, it seemed like he was a father trying to disapline his children more then protecting the law. The Capulet's party, that's something I could go on and on about.

But I have to say, it was an interesting approach to an excellent play done by da man, Shakespeare. I saw this in the theater in 1996, and loved it at first. But then I realized it could of been done better. But it's still worth a watch.

RomeoJuliet,a wonderful remake to show the original meaning to youth,10/10,Darkray16,10/6/2002,"This movie is a wonderful remake. Youth nowadays (yes I am a young guy) cannot feel what the audience of old verona felt when they first saw the play. but with modernization and younger actors, we can feel what they felt. and for the people who have lotsa free time, there are many scenes in this movie that will foreshadow the play like *****SPOILER************************************************************ when tybalt first goes on his knees to bless his gun in the opening gun fight. behind him are the two colors of the household and him in the middle with the redshirt that I feel represents blood. ************************************************************************ its just little stuff like that I feel the director put a lot of thought into the film.

RomeoJuliet,"classic turned absurd, 2/10",2/10,lionel2,11/5/2003,"i finished watching the movie on the 4th attempt. during the first three times i found it unwatchable and shut the machine down. now after i finished it , i must say that there are a few moments in this movie that is worth watching but overall it is a failure.

to begin with, the borrowed plot no longs stands well. there are two things that could not happen in the 1990s. first, juliet's fake death shouldn't have fooled people around. with death a clearly defined in medical terms, juliet is in a coma , not death. second, the priest could have informed romeo by a variety of means other than a letter about the trick. he could use mobile phone, a pager, a computer or even a person. it is interesting to see that in the whole movie, there is no scene involving using cell phones, maybe to cover up the unconvincing plot? but there is a scene in which a postal service female clerk is using a computer. so the plot is inconsistent with modern times.

another issue which crippled the movie is that the romance between romeo and juliet is squeezed into very little time of the movie. there relationship is not seen developed in the movie, but forced forward in huge leaps. the net result is it feels that the thing between those two is nothing but youthful lust, not romantic love. in the other hand, the movie devoted major effort towards other things. all those things worked as an anti-climax to the story. some commentators say it is pathetic and i can't agree more. the only two scenes that are aesthetically pleasing are the moment when romeo first meet juliet and the moment when juliet is waking up but romeo has swallowed the real poison.

last i want to say something about the cast. the best delivering person in this movie is the priest, who actually feels like shakespears' character. then comes juliet. it is because of her that a fews moments of this movie shine. the maiden and juliet's fiance are also decent but the rest of characters ( including romeo, who smoke and do drugs ) are really annoying, to say the least.

i think that is about it, a failed attempt to exploit on shakespears' play. it is interesting to see that females under age of 18 are among the users that give the highest rating to this movie. so, i think i can finish off my comment with a sly smile on my face knowing that even movie as absurd as this one worked for teenagers. lol

RomeoJuliet,The Best Modern Day Shakespeare Adaptation.,10/10,powermandan,19/2/2015,"Flamboyant and overly-fashionable director, Baz Luhrmann's breakout film has become a sensation in the world of romance and Shakespeare. He casts some recognizable stars with young upstarts that would dominate the screen for years to come. Luhrmann brings the timeless story to the present in such a way that has some people loving it and others hating it.

Taking place in the present, everybody are surfers/punks. It is cool to see Shakespeare being to hip and cool. The guns, cars, music, and costumes really appeal to this generation's teen.

Romeo & Juliet is probably the best known Elizabethan play as well as the best known love story ever told. For those that don't know the plot, Romeo Montague's (DiCaprio) and Juliet Capulet's (Danes) families have always had violent feuds in Verona, Italy. As young teenagers, they meet, fall in love, get married, then kill themselves because each think the other is dead after they wake up with convincing evidence--all over a three day period. People that don't like the story hate how young they are, how quickly they get married, and how easily they commit suicide. First of all, the play is 500 years old. Second of all, that is what Shakespeare wanted people to think about. Kids their age and younger always say they are in love and they want to get married. Don't go saying they are too young to fall in love and get married when that thought crossed your mind! As for the suicide, it fits. Dying to be be with the person you love is the most romantic thing of all. I can't help but feel heartbroken when they die. Aside from that, their deaths were the only way for the Montagues and Capulets to restore peace among themselves and all of Verona. When I first read this play and studied it in high school, I was one of the only people that liked the ending because I thought it just ""fit."" I had no idea why for the longest time. Now I know.

Romeo is regarded as one of DiCaprio's best known roles, but not one of his best-known performances. I would easily say it is in his top five. Everybody else in this is not quite as well known as Leo, but they shine in this and in their other movies. Most of the criticism I've seen from this are from the performances themselves. They say everybody has no idea how to act Elizabethan or how to deliver Shakespeare lines. Roger Ebert said Pete Postelthwaite was the only exception because he was the one that knew how to deliver the lines. Sure he is a talented actor, but nothing is entirely wrong with the performances. The actors talked as if they were thinking it, not with a rhythm. Sir Laurence Olivier was the first actor to break the rule of Shakespeare being rhythmic and natural. So the acting really isn't bad. People were just unused to seeing these Hollywood giants saying things they can't understand.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare's Views,2/10,nncarmic,7/5/2013,"Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.

RomeoJuliet,"Radical, but perhaps not radical enough?",5/10,Libretio,28/1/2000,"WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIET

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)

Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

With its contemporary setting and rough, insistent visuals, Baz Luhrmann's reinterpretation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" adds a very 90s spin to the Bard's tale, targeting the youth market (notoriously disenchanted with the works of Shakespeare) with an aggressive, in-yer-face style. As such, the film is hip and sexy, and Old Bill's yarn has much to offer, but while Claire Danes' Juliet is the very picture of grace and innocence, Leonardo di Caprio - undoubtedly a fine young actor - seems out of place as Romeo, and he's upstaged in the good looks department by Paul Rudd as Paris. There's a show-stopping dance number (part of a drug-induced hallucination) at the masked ball where the two lovers first meet, and the second half of the film is powered by a raw emotional intensity, but a truly radical revision of the play might have involved the scrapping of Shakespeare's text altogether and the substitution of 90s dialogue to match the visuals.",pos

Anchorwoman: A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence and have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.

RomeoJuliet,Oh Dear.,1/10,chris-stanley67,3/11/2007,"As someone who enjoyed the original film and thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, my honest opinion is that this version fails miserably no matter how you look at it. If it was meant to appeal to those who know and love the story (myself included) then in my opinion it fails because of the attempt to bring it into the present day.

If on the other hand it was meant to appeal to a younger generation and to perhaps introduce Shakespeare to a whole new audience then it surely fails on the grounds that the original script is kept despite the modern day setting. Do both, or do neither.

For me, and for both my son and daughter, this was a film that was a real struggle to get through.

Short and sweet, but honest.

When I saw this movie, I hadn't read the text. Everything that happened in this crap called a movie was a blur. Frank Z. did a much better job in 1968. Go see it. This movie doesn't hold a candle to it. I mean think about it. Guns with this language? No!!! Don't spend your time, money, or effort watching this movie. READ IT WITH NO NOTES IF THAT'S THE CASE!!! West Side Story is good if you like the story of Romeo and Juliet. It is a musical. I loved every minute of it. GO SEE THAT! If anyone disagrees, please comment on why I should go see it.

RomeoJuliet,a study in bad acting,2/10,bassocantante,24/10/2001,"This is the worst reading of Shakespeare I've seen since my high school drama days. Leonardo DiCaprio gets particularly low marks. Actually, I think the cocky teenager who played Romeo in my high school production was better than this. I'm not wild about ""modern"" settings of Shakespeare, but some have been done very well and have been highly effective. This production does not fall into that class.

For an outstanding film version of the play, see the 1968 Zeffirelli production. I saw that version when it first came out and was blown away by the beauty and energy of the film.

RomeoJuliet,An interesting movie,9/10,marvy42,2/3/2015,"I usually don't like modern interpretations of Shakespeare. Hamlet, done in 19th Century Ruritania, never sat right with me. However, I really liked this one. I don't know how many of the cast were actually Shakespearean actors, but what interested me is that they didn't try to be. If Leonardo DiCaprio had declaimed and emoted and tried to chew up the scenery, he would have fallen flat. Instead, he just read the lines; and it worked. The same applies to the rest of the cast. They all just read the lines (convincingly, but not Shakespearean-ly) and got on with the play. I especially liked Miriam Margolyes playing The Nurse as a Mexican maid. In addition, the photography was visually stunning. In all, a very competent and pleasant movie.

RomeoJuliet,Modern Shakespeare,6/10,Kane-C,28/6/1999,"The most popular love story in history, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, converted to modern day sets. The director and writer of the movie decided to handle the conflicts between modern day sets and Shakespeare's original texts with the means of comedy. This was not necessarily a bad idea, since Shakespeare may be somewhat boring at times, and small humorous bits make the movie..well, less boring. But the result was, that Luhrmann almost turned the love story of all times into the comedy of the year. The movie is by no means bad, but it does not have the spirit of Shakespeare's texts. This movie is a disgrace to the original play, but if one is able to ignore this fact, one can see this movie as a brilliant love story. Well, of course it is, it's Shakespeare after all, so the story is exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is not just a pretty boy, but he can act, too! His performance is brilliant, and Clare Danes' is amazing, also. So a movie with wonderful acting performances and an exceptional script can't be bad, but there's just a tad too much humor involved, this story does not need that. I can't help myself, I am comparing the movie to the original play, so I think the movie is not that great.",pos
RomeoJuliet,What a wonderful update! I loved it!,10/10,ash-032,20/1/2002,"I was only about 9 years old when this movie had first been released and I hadn't been able to see it until now. I am 14 now, and I read Romeo and Juliet, the play, for English as most freshmen like me have. I had to watch both versions of the movie as well (the 1968 Zeffirelli version and this 1996 version). As you could probably predict, I enjoyed the 1996 version better, mainly because it is a version I can relate to more. I had to watch it in class and then the following weekend, I went out and bought it because I enjoyed it so much.

I really don't like Shakespeare at all, and I don't know much about ""how good"" actors are speaking in Old English, but I thought overall, Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were good at it. Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry onscreen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fishtank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.

But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene. It felt like that was only going on for 1 minute. What I also didn't like was the relationship between Romeo and Mercutio. Mercutio... a drug dealer? The two were supposed to play best friends but they only seemed like casual acquaintances and ""drug buddies"" in this movie.

The special effects were great, and the music was wonderful. In my opinion, I truly enjoyed this movie a lot. Good acting, and an excellent modern remake on an old classic. This is a movie today's teenagers will enjoy, but if you're older, I would think that you would like the '68 version because it keeps the traditional stuff. (At least my parents liked the 1968 version better). I really think you should go out and rent it. You'll be happy you did.

RomeoJuliet,Yey for Romeo + Juliet!!,10/10,julyia90,5/2/2005,"This was a great movie. Id GUESS I could have voted it as like a 9, but it was so good. Leonardo Dicaprio knew what he was doing and that made the movie twice as good. I love how they talked in 'old' English, or Shakespearan English. Superb. I loved how the people were played, and although Mercutio and Tybult were played disappointingly, they still scraped by. I thought they should have had a different Mercutio, and had Tybult act a bit differently. He acted decently, BUT he was weird and had weird teeth and didn't look Tybult-y enough, And thats speaking as a Shakespearan fan. Annnnd this is not long enough and IMDb is not letting me submit it, so blah blah blah and but I think maybe Reese Witherspoon should have played Juliet. Claire Danes did a good job but I think Witherspoon (with a brown-haired wig, of course) would have done nicely, too.

RomeoJuliet,My favorite part was the credits,1/10,survivor_fan,11/5/2008,"First, I would like to say, Don't see this movie. It was painful. I was forced to watch it for three days in my Lit class, but after only a few minutes I put my head down and began to cry. Its like shoving a sharpened stick in both eyes while simultaneously pulling a Van Gogh and cutting your ears off. In fact, I would rather do those things than ever watch this piece of crap ever again. My biggest problem was the dialogue. You can't just say things like, ""But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!""In modern times. It sounds stupid. Baz needed to either modernize the dialogue, or not make this movie. Zeffereli's version was amazingly good, compared to this one anyway, and West Side Story, was also good. West Side story was COMPLETELY modernized, and it worked. This version, half modernized, did NOT work. so in short, don't see this movie. I would rather have rabid dogs attack me than ever be attacked by this crappy, movie, with no-talent actors, terrible directing, and stupid ideas. Mercutio as a transvestite drug dealer, come on!

RomeoJuliet,visually stunning but badly acted.,2/10,Bardcastle,1/8/2007,"This is Shakespeare for Dummies. While visually stunning and full of action, the acting is sub par at best. Whther this is the fault of the actors or the director I cannot say, but the lines are delivered melodramatically. Apparently these people do not know how to put emotion into their lines without shouting. Furthermore, the way the lines are delivered when not shouted are given with bizarre inflections and accents on words and syllables that blur the meaning of the speeches. As a teacher of literature, I would not recommend this movie. While I believe that Shakepeare can be made accessible to today's youth, especially urban youth, in doing so, this movie loses the original vision: to tell the story well.

RomeoJuliet,"What the hell? Seriously, what the hell.",1/10,convicteddrowning1,7/12/2004,"When I first saw this movie, I really did think it was a joke. When I first heard the dialouge, I thought it was stupid to make a film placed in the 90's and have the original dialouge of the books. I thought this movie was a comedy until the end, until I realized ""They're actually serious.""

This movie was so inane, that I could barely stand to watch all of it. I even puked in my mouth a couple of times. How could they even think of doing this? 10 things I hate about you was a Shakespearian adaption, and they didn't use the same Old English this did. How stupid.

Shitty movie. 1/5

RomeoJuliet,tugs at your heartstrings.,9/10,bellalevis,3/9/2018,"Now, i'm not going to lie, i was very confused when watching the first twenty minutes - and vaguely dissapointed. so, i stopped watching and figured i should've given it another shot later on. i did just this, and i'm quite happy i did so.

first off, the casting for this film was quite well done. the chemistry between leo and claire became evident throughout, giving them a persuasive and emotional performance. the only character i was slightly bothered by was tybalt, as he came across as endelessly angry. otherwise, all of the actors worked well together.

the modern spin on things was actually a pleasant surprise, the shakespearian dialogue still keeping the original feeling of the play. it made the romance and the tragedy even more enhanced, as the words themselves were romantic.

i don't remember crying so bloody hard at a film. the ending, where romeo had come across juliet's seemingly dead body, and the bittersweet feeling you got as she was awoken and he was on the verge of death is where it got me. the soundtrack and beauty of the shots conveyed this sadness, and one of the last scenes when they were both laying dead led me to cry for a good half hour afterwards.

this film is amazing. do watch it.",pos

RomeoJuliet,Baroque drama in a rave party landscape.,9/10,sergicaballeroalsina,11/3/2018,"A movie in which this text is faithfully interpreted should be a pretty movie even with eyes closed. We should agree that theoretically there is no better dramatic text than any classic from the pen of Shakespeare. From this I deduce that at least half of the artistic purpose of the film is satisfactorily resolved. We could discuss its aesthetics although I think that has to do with personal taste. A wannabe contemporary drama through the post-modern setting of the rave parties landscapes and an aesthetic halfway between cyber-punk and techno of the second half of the 90s that refers to other movies of the decade. In this way it achieves the task of transferring such an important text to those days. I think that Baz Luhrmann could not have thought of a better way to recreate a paradigmatically baroque play that also containes his so characteristic aesthetic universe. The simplicity or complexity of the characters can not be discussed either; Only the performances can be questioned, but they develop favorably through the remarkable work of the actors. Be careful because if you are willing to contemplate the most famous love story in the world in a truly unprecedented environment, this can become one of your favorite dramas.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Good concept ruined by talentless leads,4/10,Grifter84,26/7/1999,"This film has the makings of greatness, but falls so short after the first scene. The vibrant visual style and art direction is brilliant and the director handles the updating of the classic 16th century love story almost seamlessly. On top of that, the supporting cast, especially Postlethwaite, Sorvino and Leguizamo are well suited to the roles.

It all falls apart, however, when we are introduced to our leads. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved himself to be a talented actor in such films as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""This Boy's Life,"" but his just isn't him at his best. He tries hard, but he's inexperienced with Shakespeare and can't get himself around the unnatural language and rhythm. Those lines he doesn't mangle he shouts unintelligibly.

Clare Danes gave us a good performance in ""The Rainmaker,"" but is totally uninspired in this role. Her style is flat, and she delivers the lines with as much talent as the average highschooler would in a school production.

The director had what could have been a very powerful and entertaining movie, but undermines it with the casting of two singularly unsuited actors in the title roles for the sake of drawing more of the MTV teenage crowd to the box office.

For a better rendition of Juliet, I suggest Olivia Hussey in the 1968 Zeffirelli version. For a better Romeo, try Gwyneth Paltrow's transgender performance in ""Shakespeare in Love.""",neg

RomeoJuliet,Great Modern Adaptation of a Great Script,8/10,alejandrocastrom,20/11/2018,"Scene 5 of Act 1 is one of the highlights of Baz Luhrmann's film adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". Not only is the story well portrayed, but it also has great actors such as the stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes to reenact the characters Romeo and Juliet respectively.

I am a big fan of Shakespeare which is why I love it when films that are based on his scripts are able to fulfill his original purpose even if there are some differences compared the original version of the play. This was mostly the case for this scene of ""Romeo + Juliet"" since it followed the same story and language from the original script, however it differed in some key aspects. In general, the film kept some of the essential events from the script since all of the language used comes from the original script and the same events are kept. These were: Tybalt and Lord Capulet's argument and Romeo and Juliet meeting and having a ""love at first sight"" moment as well as finding out they are both from opposite rival families. In this film, all main purposes from Shakespeare's original script are kept even though they are sometimes portrayed a bit differently. For example, the film occurs in a modern context where we see people dressed up in costumes and there is alcohol, drugs, electricity, etc. This doesn't affect Shakespeare's purpose since the only thing that changes is how some of the characters act as well as the general look of the party which is changed mostly due to the context of the viewers such as myself since a halloween party might be more common and relatable for our time. The key aspect of the setting from Shakespeare's script is that it's a party made by the Capulet family which is something that is kept for this adaptation. Another part of the scene which I thought followed Shakespeare's original purpose very well was when Romeo and Juliet see each other for the first time and instantly fall in love. This part was quite different to the original script since they stare at each other for a few minutes and don't speak to each other until after Juliet dances with Paris. This change in the script actually enforces Shakespeare's purpose since it adds on to the obstacles that lie between Romeo and Juliet's relationship. The last part I want to mention from scene 5 is the argument between Tybalt and Capulet. In the original script, the scene begins with Tybalt and Capulet arguing over Romeo's presence at their family's party, with Tybalt finally losing the argument and foreshadowing that his anger towards Romeo is not over with the line ""I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall; Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall"". In the film, this argument occurs towards the middle of the scene rather than at the beginning when Tybalt approaches Lord Capulet who is most likely drunk or drugged given his gestures throughout the conversation. Despite the change of the order, this part of the scene does fulfill Shakespeare's purpose which is to increase the tension between these two rival families and show how this affects Romeo and Juliet's relationship.

I definitely enjoyed watching this adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" because despite being different in many key aspects, it still manages to keep the original purposes of Shakespeare and it works. Perhaps it is not the best movie from a filmmaker's perspective, but for anyone who enjoys the works of Shakespeare and this original play, you will not be disappointed by the adaptation.

The acting in super good. Leo and Claire were young but their acting were very very good. Some of the supporting actors were too awesome to forget.

The director did something unique with this story. Its brave and new and in the end gave us a movie which the audience will probably never forget watching. The way he merged modern time with this classic story is weird yet interesting.

RomeoJuliet,Pretty much worth it,8/10,ericstevenson,16/8/2017,"This was actually a pretty early attempt to modernize the classic ""Romeo And Juliet"" story by placing it in modern times. I admit that some of the movie does come off as being off key. It's kind of weird to see a version of RAJ that begins with gunfire and explosions, but don't worry. The film gets much better later. Anyway, it's really fascinating to see how 90s this movie is. I mean, it pretty much envisions everything that made the 90s what it was and seeing as how it's an update of a classic story, that makes sense. For the most part, it's certainly good.

The original dialogue is kept, but there is one big change near the end. Juliet actually briefly awakes and witnesses Romeo die. It's not that important, but it's still interesting to see something different with such a popular story. We're even told that the families have a rivalry that's implied to go back to the times of when the original story takes place. It even begins by showing us what happens at the very end. Seeing as how everyone knows how it ends, it's a very clever way of setting it up and it makes for a good movie. ***",pos
RomeoJuliet,Highly accessible and exuberant Shakespeare adaptation,8/10,a_chinn,27/5/2017,"Wildly fun adaptation of William Shakespeare's play by writer/director Baz Luhrmann. Changing the setting of Shakespeare's plays for film adaptations isn't a new thing. It had previously been done as musicals, westerns, samurai films, gangster pictures, indie dramas about street hustlers, teen comedies, teen dramas, and so on and so forth, but none of those films brought the exuberance and audacity as this film. Set in a Venice Beach-like setting between two feuding wealthy business family empires, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague and Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, with their star cross lover children, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, in roles that really put their stars on the Hollywood map, at the center of the drama. The film faithfully follows the source material's story and all of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but the dialogue is amazingly accessible and understandable from the actors speaking the lines in a very naturalistic manner. Laurence Olivier was actually criticized in his day for delivering lines in too naturalistic of a manner and not in the traditional more sing-song of manner, which Kenneth Branagh took even further, but this film puts that on a whole new level. Actors here are gangsters, street punks, and thugs and deliver their lines as such, but their words are accessible in a way I'd never seen before that retained Shakespeare's original words. In some ways, it's kind of like Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" where most all of the characters spoke as if they were off the mean streets of Brooklyn. In both cases it served to connect the characters and stories to modern audiences and crate less of a distance between the two. The film also drips of 1990s cool, with a very hip soundtrack and many fashions of the day (with a hint of Elizabethan). The film features a strong cast that also includes Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis- Hall, M. Emmet Walsh, Jamie Kennedy, and a memorable Vincent Laresca. But the real start is Bad Luhrmann, who's combination of visuals, sound, and editing created a film so full of energy and audacity that it stands apart from any other Shakespearian film adaptation and is something truly unique. My only complaint about the film is that the modernization of the story also makes Romeo and Juliet's drama and romance seem overly trite and self important in a way that I found annoying. To the teens and teen audiences, I'm sure their love and feelings are very real and serious and worthy of live & death, but at the same time these are kids and they really shouldn't be taking themselves all that seriously. Leo and Clair might as well be the self important teens from ""13 Reasons Why"" for how overly serious they take themselves. Still, I don't think middle age men were Luhrmann's target audience here (i.e. me), so my criticism is probably not valid (i.e. I'm just being a cranky old man). Still, this is a wonderfully original film that demands multiple viewings.",pos

RomeoJuliet,Tragic love story,9/10,tamminenamanda,26/4/2017,"Movie review: Romeo + Juliet

Romeo + Juliet is a romantic drama film from 1996. The movie is a modernization and adaption of William Shakespeare's famous play Romeo and Juliet. The movie retained the original dialogue from Shakespeare's play. The film is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as Romeo and Juliet. The film can be best described as a tragic love story, the most famous one of all.

The movie takes place in Verona Beach. Romeo and Juliet are entangled in a lifelong feud between their families, the Capulets and the Montagues. They instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party the Capulets are having. The pair is soon married in hopes the marriage will ease the tension between the archenemy families. Juliet's parents try to marry their daughter off to another man, but Juliet loves Romeo. Juliet plans to run away with him, but the plan goes horribly wrong.

The story of these star crossed lovers is known to all. I think the movie did a good job at bringing it to the modern era. Some details have been changed from the original story to modernize it, like for example swords have been replaced with guns. I think the changes were a good decision. They make the story more believable and relatable for today's people.

In my opinion the cast of Romeo + Juliet was well chosen and they did the world-famous characters justice. I also like the soundtrack of the movie because it's so dramatic yet modern in a way and thereby suits the movie and its storyline. It would be very bizarre if this particular movie's soundtrack were any less emotional and powerful. I think keeping the original dialogue worked well. What I don't like about the film is that it's sometimes a bit confusing and disorderly, and I'm also not particularly fond of the character of Juliet's mother. I didn't think she really fit into the film.

All in all the movie is very good and I think it did Shakespeare's original play justice. I would recommend it to pretty much everyone. I give Romeo + Juliet 4 stars out of a possible 5.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"It was bad, they do everything wrong and don't stick with the plot.",1/10,kokiedragon,28/3/2017,"SPOILER IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE PLOT OF ROMEO AND JULIET

Romeo is dramatic and goes to a party where he kisses an engaged girl he just met. They then become deeply in ""love"" and are really dramatic and threaten to kill themselves a lot. Romeo kills his girl's cousin and says its not his fault, it's fate's. Then they kill themselves in an annoying way.


Everything was awful, over-dramatic to the max even though it was set in a modern setting. There was no Paris in the ending scene, what happened to him????

Like if you could marry Paul Rudd wouldn't you? she knew Romeo for like an hour and killed herself when he died.

Also Juliet saw Romeo kill himself and didn't speak up it was bad, too many candles.

cinematography was so all over the place, it made me nauseous.

Where were her parents and nurse when she was ""dead"", it was like Friar Lawrence sneaked in and called the authorities?

RomeoJuliet,Chemistry Between Principals Makes This Watchable,5/10,zkonedog,2/3/2017,"Back in ninth grade English class, our teacher showed us this movie after we read William Shakespeare's famous play. The film made an impression on me back then, and I wanted to see what would happen 15 years later. It isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, but ""Romeo + Juliet"" does manage to render the tale in a bit more of a user-friendly format.

For a basic plot summary, this movie uses the exact language of Shakespeare's play...but sets it in a modern, urban environment. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) are the principles, of course, while Harold Perrineau & John Leguizamo have important roles as Mercutio and Tybalt, respectively.

What makes this film hold up at least somewhat are the performances by DiCaprio & Danes. They are perfect for their roles and have great on-screen chemistry. Both ended up being fine thespians, so in hindsight this should not have been surprising. Many fans of the Romeo & Juliet story laud the 1968 version as ""top dog"", but IMHO the two principles here, at least, put up performances every bit as good as from the earlier effort.

The reason this one isn't an all-time classic? The direction from Baz Luhrmann is just too weird. I don't understand why they couldn't have kept the urban, modern feel without making things so bizarre. The duels between the houses are terribly over-the-top, while I've never once understood why viewers need to see Mercutio prance around in drag for so long. Even the camera work and cinematography is odd/bizarre. Had they toned down that craziness a bit, this could have rocketed higher for me. As it was, like I mentioned earlier, I really only enjoyed the Romeo/Juliet interactions.

Overall, ""Romeo + Juliet"" is good for showing reluctant Shakespearean ""scholars"" (e.g. high- schoolers), but other than that it is decidedly average. DiCaprio and Danes give it their all, but all the weird stuff going on around them really detracts from the passion of the story. If only they had played it just slightly more serious...",neg

He died and Juliet shot herself.i also like the part when they had a shootout at the gas station. i like the modern time better. They had guns instead of swords and things like that. They also played their parts good and made it seem real. I like how they made the movie Romeo+Juliet that was a good movie. Romeo was strong brave and helpful. When him and Juliet was married that was the happiest day of his life. I LIKE THE MOVIE

RomeoJuliet,my personal favorite,10/10,vier1,5/8/2014,"Romeo and Juliet might be the greatest love story of all times and I do not want to get into detail too much about what it is about in this review - which is my first on IMDb. I would rather like to somewhat share with you the way I experienced it.

Back in my teenage years I saw Romeo + Juliet in cinema twice within a week. It is the only movie I went twice to cinema for. Although I knew roughly what the play was about the story kept me in suspense so much I still had a lump in my throat the day after I watched this movie the first time. To that day I had never been as fascinated by anything and really had to think about this tale for days to come. So it was the first time I got to witness the ""whole"" story and in retrospect it probably was the best version for me. It was magic.

I could identify myself with Romeo - he was like who i wanted to be - exceptionally played by DiCaprio and I fell in Love with Julia - stunningly beautiful, just everything - brilliantly played by Claire Danes. DiCaprio had already been one of my favorite actors before (and after) what I can not say about Claire Danes in general but in that role she was near perfect to me. Other stand-out performances I would like to mention are the strong characterization of Mercutio played by the best Harold Perrineau I have seen while in the part of Tybalt John Leguizamo excels himself either.

The settings and direction of this movie are plain fantastic from my point of view. Along with the contemporary interpretation of Shakespeare's genuine play Baz Luhrmann managed to create a pretty special atmosphere that feels surreal, menacing but at the same time highly appealing. Without the original lyrics used in this adaption I could imagine Romeo + Juliet to be an absolutely intoxicating flick but the dreamlike poetry propel it's atmosphere to another level.

I like movies to tell me an interesting story in the first place and showcase it the way it feels right. To this day no other movie could outreach the impact Romeo + Juliet had on me. The first Love usually is the deepest and there is nothing perfect in this world except for true Love..",pos
RomeoJuliet,The movie that made Claire Danes a star,9/10,Red-125,19/6/2014,"Romeo + Juliet (1996) was directed by Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann is know for his cutting-edge approach to filmmaking, and R + J is no exception. He's updated the setting of Shakespeare's play from Renaissance Verona to contemporary Verona, Florida. However, he's kept Shakespeare's language. Other directors have used the same technique, but I haven't seen a Shakespeare play in a modern setting that is this loud, this noisy, and this filled with primary colors. It's a determinedly modern film, despite the language.

To make this concept work, Luhrmann needed the right actors. Leonardo DiCaprio did well enough as Romeo. He was 21 when the film was made, and still had a slender, youthful charm. I think he should keep his day job, though. I'm not eager to watch him play Shakespeare on the stage.

By contrast, Claire Danes is the perfect Juliet. From the minute we set eyes on her, we say, ""This is Juliet."" Danes portrays both the strength and vulnerability that define Juliet. (We tend to think of Juliet as a victim, and she is. However, she's not just a victim. She's a tough, tenacious young woman who struggles fiercely against tremendous odds, and almost wins.)

Danes was only 16 when R + J was shot, but she was already a seasoned actor. However, it was Luhrmann's film that made her a star. After that, there was no stopping her. I believe she would be extremely successful acting Shakespeare on the stage. Think of her as Lady MacBeth. Danes could goad a husband into killing his king, and she would make everyone in the theater believe that she could do it.

The other actors in the film ranged from competent to excellent. I would single out the outstanding work of Harold Perrineaus as Mercutio. When he says, ""A plague on both your houses,"" he makes you understand that he means it.

R + J has a modest 6.9 IMDb rating. My guess is that it was too old-fashioned for people who wanted a traditional action film, and too wide a stretch for people who wanted classic Shakespeare. I think the movie deserves more than 6.9, and I recommend it.

This is a film that will work much better on a large screen than a small screen. Police helicopters, and views from helicopters, will lose some of their power if not seen on a large screen. On the other hand, the film is noisy and drenched with color. If that's not to your taste, the movie might work better on a small screen, where you are somewhat removed from the immediacy of the action.

If you don't like Shakespeare, or if you don't like modern-version Shakespeare, here's my suggestion. See the film, and fast forward through the scenes that don't include Juliet. When Claire Danes is on the screen, watch carefully.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Neat modern adaptation on Shakespeare's tragedy.,8/10,OllieSuave-007,12/6/2014,"This is a neat modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic and tragic tale, Romeo and Juliet, where the feuding families of the Montagues and the Capulets are foretold in the Italian city of Verona. The lives and affair of star-crossed lovers Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet are complicated by their feuding families.

Though set in modern times, this movie still follows Shakespeare's play somewhat to a T, helped by the actors' theatrical delivery of the original dialog, the intense drama and the enchanting story. Director Baz Luhrmann did a great job putting together the movie, placing his own unique style into the play but retaining the original intent of the story. The entire setting and scenery are set in this very wildly multi-colored atmosphere, giving the movie a very hip element. Lastly, the cast of characters were nicely assembled, all pulling off some very bold acting performances.

Overall, it's a good combination of classic theater and modern Hollywood cinema.

Not sure who's bright idea it was to do this pseudo modern day interpretation of Romeo and Juliet, but it was a horrible idea, or at least a horrible implementation. 2 teenagers running around Southern California beaches in the late 1990's while reciting Romeo and Juliet in The King's English, just does NOT work. No surprise that it got decent treatment by movie critics, it has plenty of men singing and dancing around in drag in the party scene, which looked more like your typical San Francisco party than anything else. The movie critics just eat that up with a spoon, all the while calling it avant-garde. Do yourself a favor and just re-read the book, or watch the 1968 adaptation if you want to see a movie. Or if you're a Leo fan, you could always just re-watch James Cameron's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, if you actually want to ENJOY a movie.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare would roll in his grave....,4/10,ILuvPrincessDiaries2,27/2/2011,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I began to watch this movie. Perhaps I still had in mind the 3 other Shakespearean films that I loved - and understood. That love ended here. While I appreciate what they were going for in this - probably to make high school kids enjoy it more (I'm a Much Ado about Nothing fan myself). However, the attempted mixing of modern day Verona and Shakeespearean language just don't seem to mix. While in any other setting (almost) the language might seem deep, perhaps difficult to follow,yet in this movie it just seemed insincere, and very stiff. I would recommend getting a different version of the classic tale if you are looking for true Shakespeare.

RomeoJuliet,"Worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""....",3/10,tmpj,12/9/2010,"I understand the basic motive of the producers of this thing-a-ma-bob, based on the work of Shakespeare, who based his upon other works of the period. It was a grand effort, but it fails miserably. To update this classic story to modern, hip-hop times and still keep the Elizabethan English in the script is a sort of a death warrant in and of itself. It is clumsy, corny, and a bit superfluous. It stumbles over its own two left feet. I suffered through one viewing of it, praying that it would soon be over. After what felt like an eternity, it finally was over. I would never want to sit through this movie again. It lacked character, substance, and credibility. Plus, there is a great deal of otherwise terrific talent wasted along the way. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino would be worth the price of admission alone, were it another, more credible vehicle. But they come off looking like fools in this play in search of an identity for itself. Leonardo does the best he can to make this thing work, but...terrific actor that he is...he simply does not have the depth to pull this one off. The direction was fast paced and intense, and that was one of the problems with it. The actors had no real opportunity to let the characters come to life and to allow the script to breathe. The result...it moves at too quick a pace, it never quite settles in, and the actors sound as if they are reciting their lines, as opposed to allowing the lines to be delivered at a credible, believable pace. The modernization of the story is also a sore point. To bring this story into the age of greed and moral degradation tends to over shadow the point...that this is a story of love and of just plain rivalry between two families that do not see eye to eye. Romeo and Juliet pay the price for the foolish attitudes of their families, a situation that rings as clear to-day as it did way back in the days of old. The producers wanted to take the story a step beyond ""West Side Story"", which was also a variation on the Romeo/Juliet tragedy...but it failed in this modern day translation. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was badly done because it had virtually no budget, and dealt with the death of a principal cast member during filming. This one had the budget, but it was still badly done, badly written, and badly executed. Maybe another production company will undertake the mantle and do a more respectable job.",neg
RomeoJuliet,It was a pretty good idea gone sour,5/10,doc-55,12/8/1999,"The play has been updated many times into contemporary or historic environments, often successfully as in West Side Story. The setting in southern California and once again conencting it with contemporary conflicts was a legitimate approach to the play. The language should have been updated as well, as has been done by a number of scholars. Using what was essentially Shakespeare's original text, while well-intentioned, created what I saw as the film's downfall. The young actors were just not up to the demands of Shakepearean dialogue. The production values were outstanding. It was a pretty good idea gone sour.

RomeoJuliet,Wow...,1/10,nitefire-1,21/11/2007,"this movie was terrible. It's the play that has been around for decades, and could quite possibly be one of the most recognized love stories in the history of man. Having said that, it could also possibly be one of the most Boring films ever made and then, they go and make a modernized version of the film?? I don't know weather they meant for this to be a smash hit, or if their intent was to just bore the audience to death. h'm Let's discuss the plot. The film starts off with a street brawl between the two feuding families Capulet, and Montague. The prince soon breaks this up and declares that ""lives will pay the forfeit of the piece"". The film continues on until Romeo meets Juliet at the Capulet ball. After the two lovers meet, and fall in love they decide to plan a secret marriage. But it's not long before their plans are skewed after Romeo is banished from Verona for killing Tybalt, who killed Mercutio  a close friend of Romeos'. The secret affairs and family conflicts in both films eventually lead to tragedy. In the 1968 film of Romeo and Juliet directed by Franco Zeffirelli, the character of romeo and Juliet are played by Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey along with John McEnery as Mercutio, Michael York as Tybalt and Bruce Robinson as Benvolio. The acting in this film is terrible to say the least. Both Romeo and Juliet seemed superficial and immature, and the acting was always either overdone or underdone. I realize that it is a very dramatic style, but it was just excruciating to watch. I found it hard to respect a Juliet that would hide behind the nurse like a toddler, while lord Capulet yelled at her. While some people enjoy this type of acting (pause, look at James) I found that the drama was overdone to the point where it was unwatchable. Despite the fact that I also despise the modernized film, I would certainly recommend the newer film over this one. I don't think the film worked at all.

the end :)",neg
RomeoJuliet,Horrendous!!,1/10,iron_jawed_angel91,27/6/2005,"Firstly, the story of Romeo and Juliet has been done too many times, and contains no real substance. Second, this modern angle makes it worse than ever before. DiCaprio is a terrible actor, they should have cast someone who can show emotion and speak properly. Danes annoys me because she is always emotionless and appears to be high. The soundtrack had nothing to do with the movie, and was irritating. The only amusing part was when Mercutio dressed up as a transvestite. Bad movie, poorly made, overrated, and painful to watch. Did I mention that the story is insulting to women? If you're looking for a good Shakespearean romance flick, check out ""Shakespeare In Love"", instead.

RomeoJuliet,"Positively, the worst film ever made",1/10,FargoUT,15/11/1998,"As a film critic, I expand my interest into other arts. Theater is merely one of my interests. Shakespeare is a God, too. I've seen many versions of Shakespeare's plays, including Branagh's Henry V, and Much Ado About Nothing. But boy, nothing really prepared me for this piece of crap. Take all of the bad movie experiences you've ever had, and put them together. Ready? Okay, now you still don't have how bad this movie is. Baz Luhrmann has destroyed Shakespeare in ridiculous form. Despite the entertaining two minute opening sequence, this film is completely unimportant. It's a waste of celluloid as we know it. True pain. It's the only film I've actually walked out of the theater on. Those theaters should provide courtesy buckets so you can heave and spew all you want. Good Shakespeare? Watch Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. Nothing compares. DiCaprio and Danes are great actors... this just proves how great actors can be very, very bad. Never see this film. It's like watching a bad Plan 9 from Outer Space (yes, I realize Plan 9 is bad, but compared to this film, it's Citizen Kane). It should be wiped off the surface of the earth. Thank you.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Not entertaining in the least,1/10,Mhjm6,25/10/2005,"This has to be Leonardo Decaprio's worst movie. Before I saw it, I heard it was good...WRONGO! This good-for-nothing film is Shakespeare material presented in a pretty bad way. For example, it would have been a whole lot better if they could manage saying the same stuff in Shakespearian, but only in plain English. That, and the environment. If you ask me, it's in a poor setting for this movie. Verona BEACH, California has never been somewhere where anyone talks like this and it totally falls out of place for the dialogue. For a Shakepeare film, the setting has the following:

1. Masquarades where everybody is dressed like idiots and nothing really recklessly matters in their case 2. Cars 3. A pool instead of a balcony 4. Guns 5. Other stuff that is needlessly exaggerated

The only good things about it are the soundtrack and the 1968 version which is much closer to the way it is suppose to be for the dialogue AND the setting. See that instead and skip this. Not recommended.

1/10 stars.",neg
RomeoJuliet,i shouldn't have wasted my time...,1/10,milleniumlizy,30/5/2005,"This film was SUPPOSED to be a modern adaptation of the classic Shakespeare masterpiece, Romeo and Juliet. What I got instead was an utter and complete waste of my time. No, I am not some British Shakespeare fanatic who disregards any modern adaptation of this play as pure garbage-- I am an American teenager who was just hoping to see a good movie. First of all, the opening sonnet which so famously begins with ""Two households, both alike in dignity...etc."" is given to us by some nobody news anchor in a television. It isn't even said by the prince, who traditionally gives the speech. Anyone who says that the dialogue is the same as in the play is clearly mistaken. There are screwed up lines all over the place, different characters give different lines which result in major plot holes. The opening scene couldn't even be understood because of an absurd amount of gunshooting and screaming. I couldn't even understand what was going on, despite the fact that I had just gotten through re-reading that scene from the play. They cut huge amounts of the play out of the movie which were important to set up following scenes. The balcony scene SUCKED. It shouldn't even be called the balcony scene, you know why??? Miss Juliet was not on the balcony...at all! We are expected to believe that our little Romeo (poorly played by Leonardo Dicaprio) is standing five feet behind her and she doesn't notice him. It's complete absurdity that draws any seriousness out of the film. The whole suicide scene was also a bunch of rubbish. Before Romeo has even died, he sees that his love has awaken and he gets to give her his final goodbye and realize the mistake he made. For all of you history buffs out there--that is NOT supposed to happen. And then we find ourselves at the end, at the edge of our seats just DYING for it to be all over. During the last scene the Prince, (who is supposed to read the closing sonnet) screams at the top of his lungs, ""all shall be punished! all shall be punished!"" can you say plot hole? five minutes later in the closing sonnet (read by the annoying news anchor woman) we hear ""some will be pardoned, and others punished."" it basically says that some wont be royally screwed like some other characters. but that line totally contradicts what the prince had said five minutes before. especially considering he was supposed to be the one saying it! i guess what I'm saying is that this movie is TERRIBLE, even if it wasn't an adaptation, it was really just....stupid. and i pity anyone who has to bear watching the entire thing straight through.",neg
RomeoJuliet,This movie is the most pathetic movie I have ever seen.,1/10,ammmmc,4/6/1999,"This movie did not make sense. I am very familiar with the language of Shakespeare, but this movie confused even me. I guess I had a hard time hearing them speak Old English and seeing them in modern times. This movie was not just modern, it was stupid. And why did they make Mercutio into some awful transvestite? I also hated what they did to the balcony scene. Who was the genius who came up with a pool scene??? Again, very stupid! This movie is just a total waste of time. If you want to see a good adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, see the 1968, Zeffirelli version. This movie is an insult to this so called modern generation. This movie just sucks!!!

RomeoJuliet,"Baz Luhrmann, What Have Ye Wrought?",1/10,evanston_dad,17/6/2009,"Horrendous version of the Shakespeare tragedy directed by horrendous hack Baz Luhrmann, up there with Joel Schumacher and Danny Boyle among my five least favorite directors of all time.

This is ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the MTV generation, the movie equivalent of a shark, afraid that if it slows down for even a moment it will die. Luhrmann throws a bunch of images up on the screen and maintains a relentlessly ferocious pace, hoping we'll be too distracted to notice the horrible acting and the fact that our young leads don't understand the lines they're speaking. Well, that might work on teenage girls, who are probably the demographic most likely to admire this film, but I can't vouch for anyone else.

Baz Luhrmann must be stopped at all costs. Why doesn't anyone else understand that??!!!

RomeoJuliet,"Shakespeare's greatest story,love's greatest story turned into a film what could go wrong?",1/10,mcfcrdfc208,18/9/2008,"Everything to be honest.

I'm yet to see a worse film adaption off a Shakespeare story in my life,i was frankly appalled after wacthing this utter mess off a film,and to have the title off this film as 'William Shakespeare romeo + Juliet'is disgrace as this isn't remotely close to the legendary William Shakespeare's amazing love story.The use of the laungues used in this film just doesn't suite or make any sense in the new punk version off the story.

I urge you please avoid this as if your life depended on it and stick with the classic and legendary William Shakespeare's book utterly disgraceful which would make William Shakespeare turn in his grave.

RomeoJuliet,Congratulations to the (moronic) screenwriters!!!,1/10,tml_pohlak_13,27/5/2008,"NEVER, NEVER, has Shakespeare been butchered more than in ROMEO + JULIET. Don't get me wrong: I was completely open to the idea of an updated version of Shakespeare's classic. I was even looking forward to it. And then, I watched it. Shakespeare's play is a classic for a reason-- this movie was put together as if it was a last minute project for an English class. The setting is completely updated-- Romeo now has a handgun, Friar Lawrence has a cross tattooed on his back, the Capulets and Montagues engage in a gunfight. And yet, they use dialogue from the original play! The setting LOOKS modern, but the speech sounds 16th century. Now, I would not have been bothered by this, but for one other thing. THE ACTORS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RECITE Shakespeare! When DiCaprio recites his lines, he does so halfheartedly and monotonously-- as if he was saying, ""Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm in love with this girl now. What a waste of an hour. Can I just poison myself already???"". Only one character recites the Shakesperean dialogue well-- Friar Lawrence. If that was not enough, the screenwriters take delight in butchering a classic. Several key moments were omitted, such as the slaying of Paris. Mercutio, instead of being witty, is now just plain annoying. He, too, does not know how to speak Shakespeare. In short, it is an assault on the eyes, the ears, and the brain. With films like these, no wonder some people dislike Shakespeare! A plague o' all the scriptwriters!",neg
RomeoJuliet,a disgrace to Shakesphere...,2/10,asif6152000,8/6/2006,"I seen this movie and I think it is just terrible!! The acting was horrible and the character lines are stupid and don't makes sense. First of all, this movie took place present day so there's no point of talking like you are in the middle ages and it sounds so retarded because people right now don't't talk like that.

This move had the worst acting of all the movie I saw. Not to mention, Romeo smokes-what a dumb ass. Another stupid part is at the end, when Juliet shoots herself in the head, there's a hole-I swear the director is such a stupid retard. In real life, her hole brain would burst out instead of a tiny hole. Baz Luhrmann does not know how to direct and how to please audience.

If you want to see a good Romeo and Juliet film, then you should see the one that was made in 1968-that one was really good. While this one bought shame to Shakespeare My ratings: 2/10",neg
RomeoJuliet,"One of the most brilliant and stunning movies, ever.",10/10,seagreenpelei,13/2/2006,"Having seen this movie when it first came out in 1996, I immediately went out and bought it. I just watched in again today on HBO, a pleasant surprise to see it again. I can't get over how clever and brilliant this movie was done. Everything from the casting to the cinematography blows me away. John Liuguizama as Tybalt was just insane. He played the hell out of that role. No one could have done a better job than he. He prowled on the screen, like the Prince of Cats that he is and all eyes were on him.I also really dug the fact that both set of kinsmen were totally different from each other. The Capulets were dark haired, Spanish looking men-reminded me of gang members in east L.A. and the Montagues were fair-skinned and kinda punk rock looking. Stark contrasts to each other but equally as deadly with words and weapons.

My biggest gripe has always been the casting of Claire Danes as Juliet. I always felt that Juliet should be physically stunning-my choice would have been Keira Knightly. But, she did balance both the innocence and impulsiveness of a lovesick teenager with the heartbreaking realism of true love and romance.So, I guess she was OK. DiCaprio really was the star of this movie. His intensity, passion and tenderness shone brightly from beginning to end. The last scenes in the church between Romeo and his wife at her""wake"" are the most beautiful, sweet, loving shots on film. Especially when he puts the ring back on her finger- so raw and pure. There are so many other things I could say about this movie-but it is kind of hard to put it all in words. I'll just keep those to myself. But I do thank all the people who made it possible for the rest of us to enjoy a truly lovely and heartbreaking movie. I will always love this movie and if in a hundred years they try to re-make it, it wouldn't even come close.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Sequel???,1/10,nanny813,22/1/2005,"This movie was great, but they totally left it open for a sequel. When is that coming out? Omygod, Leo and Clare Danes again? Yes! And Zak Orth! More Zak Orth in this one, please! I hope the directors are reading this. Haha. Except for I wish they would not have a scene of firing handguns in a gas station this go-round. That is very dangerous. Didn't you see the models' death in ""Zoolander""? You can't do that, y'all. Attention, Kids of America: DO NOT FIRE YOUR GUNS AT A GAS STATION!! You will blow up and die. And nobody wants that to happen. I'm watching ""I love the 90s right now and they just talked about ROMEO + JULIET. Word yo.

RomeoJuliet,Very stylish,7/10,perfectbond,28/10/2003,"In this modernist interpretation of the Bard's classic, the fine performances of the leads Romeo, Juliet, Tybalt and Friar Laurence, are overshadowed somewhat by the stylized update of the classic setting. Still, one must admire the verve and audacity of the director for attempting and executing successfully, for the most part, his vision. However, I'll never forget my elderly Shakespeare professor's expression of indignation when she discussed the film version ""with the cars and guns."" I myself found the film moving to the point of tears so to me it was an unqualified success. Recommended, 8/10.

RomeoJuliet,What a disgrace,3/10,omar273,9/7/2003,"Whoah, this movie just plain stank. Who does Luhrmann think he is by adapting the brilliant Shakespeare play into a modern context? The adaptation, infact is abysmal. By keeping the Shakespearean language, but appropriating everything else makes the film seem very awkward and confusing. By restraining itself to the original language, the screenplay is horridly absurd and must the modern guns in the play are painfully engraved with the name ""SWORD"" to keep with the ""Draw your swords, etc""

The acting was also horrible. Claire Danes seemed very immature and Leo, well... where do I start?

This movie was a complete disgrace to Shakespeare and should never have been even attempted. Horrid.

RomeoJuliet,UGLY!,4/10,TwistedIvory,14/4/2003,"Granted, I'm a fan of the classic Zeffirelli version, but this ""update"" was just terrible. The MTV editing and horrible cinematography were nauseating; the acting was subpar for this story and the casting -- well, to be succinct, Leo DiCaprio had only slightly more talent in this film than Keanu Reeves exhibited in 'Bill & Ted.' This was a butchery of a classic drama. The revisions made to the original only cater to short attention spans and ugly film-making.

I rated this movie as a '4' -- it deserved that much at least because of its portrayal of Tybalt and Mercutio.

Sorry, Baz. I'm a purist on this one.

RomeoJuliet,Please don't let any more films like this get made. Somebody draft a law.,5/10,Spleen,20/7/1999,"`Romeo and Juliet', but with gangs. How audacious. How cleverly handled. I refer, of course, to `West Side Story', which didn't pretend to adapt Shakespeare, but rather adapted the same basic story that Shakespeare himself adapted when he wrote the play. For you can't have it both ways. You can cut yourself adrift from Shakespeare, force yourself to tell the story from scratch, and take a genuine risk; or you can create another performance of the play itself, in which case you will have to pay more than cursory attention to it. For instance, if Luhrmann had re-read the play, he would have noticed that it is set not in modern day Florida but in Renaissance Italy. Oops!

This modern fashion for being counter-suggestible is now very old and more tiresome than it ever was. Can you really imagine Shakespeare sitting down and saying, `I've written this rather neat tragedy about two people called Romeo and Juliet, but I can't decide on a setting. Modern-day England? That's not a bad idea. The moon? That, too, is feasible ... Ah, what the hell, I'll use Italy, but that's just my preference: do what you want.' More offensive still is a Shakespeare with this frame of mind: `Having written Romeo and Juliet, I notice that I've set it in the past. THAT was a foolish mistake. Young people these days are much too stupid to understand anything set in the past - but they'll surely watch the play if I make a big deal about how hip and trendy I am, and if my characters are dressed in the latest fashions. So, with just a few trivial changes ...'

This is an outrage. Everyone does it these days, and has for decades, but that doesn't make it any less of an outrage. It just makes the pretence of originality harder to take.

P.S.: I really ought to disclose the fact that I haven't seen this film; and, of course, I never will. Some might say this is a reason not to comment on it. I agree in general. But if a movie is a bad one, then surely there is SOME way of finding out about this, other than by watching it?",neg
RomeoJuliet,Tacky and obnoxious,1/10,KittyGrimm,13/7/2011,"The only thing that I can say about Baz Lurhmann as a director is that he is really good at adapting a classic story and making it incredibly tacky.

Perhaps my hatred for unnecessary modernizations of classics has overtaken my opinions, but there is no reason to place a Shakespeararean play and put it in a modern setting unless it's going to be put in some use or say something different from other adaptations. Shakespeare Retold did so and that was why that series worked, but the only reason this movie seems to exist is to appeal to a more shallow audience without any intellectual value whatsoever.

What I especially hate about this adaptation is not only how it pays more attention to the romance than it should do the feud between the families, but none of the actors look like they know what they were saying. Lurhmann certainly doesn't, which is made clear when he twists Mercutio's Queen Mab speech from a monologue about the challenges and temptations of lovers to a speech about drugs. If a director can't understand Shakespeare, or even has the nerve to twist his poetry that way, then he shouldn't take on that play in the first place.

The actors are vapid, the direction is awful, the editing is terrible, the setting is tacky beyond belief, it's unnecessary and it's just plain insulting to Shakespeare's text.

My only hope is that Baz Lurhmann pays more attention in English class before he takes on another classic. In fact, he should just avoid classics and save him a shred of dignity.",neg
RomeoJuliet,It made me sick. And I had no way out!,1/10,RiffRaffMcKinley,29/9/2007,"I had to read Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" twice in freshman English. I had to watch Franco Zeffirelli's unbearable adaptation twice in two different classes. Lucky for me, this was only shown once. But that scarred me for life.

Leonardo DiCaprio-- what are you ever thinking? He obviously means to prove he's a serious actor, but that all goes out the window when you consider the fact that he's been in a movie where Mercutio dresses up like Marilyn Monroe.

I won't waste any more time groaning over the terrible acting, because Luhrmann's woeful misplacement of Shakespeare's worst work ever in 1990s California is enough to bemoan this filth. It features the director's signature etherealism, which, as always, leaves me with a five-day migraine and the ever-rising taste of bile.

The actors/actresses do not just make movies great because they are in them, it's their performance (which, in this particular movie, was decent), but it's also about the MOVIE, itself.

I highly dislike this movie, which is a shame because I like many people that star in it, discluding Leonardo DiCaprio.

For me, Juliet was supposed to be an exceptionally attractive girl, who was literally brimming over with charm, intelligence and sexual appeal. Well, Claire Danes possessed none of these qualities. In fact, I found her to be so ugly and repulsive (both in looks and manner), that every time she made a screen appearance I would find myself laughing out loud at the downright absurdity of her being cast in a role that was so far out of her league.

And to think that Romeo (who really wasn't that much better in the looks department, either) would be so blind as to fall head-over-heels in love with such a dull and dog-faced girl as this, and that he was actually willing to die for her, too. Ridiculous!",neg

Admittedly, the cast is great and boasts superb performances from the young leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Other than that, this is horrible and Shakespeare would probably roll in his grave if he knew his most famous play would lead to THIS!! Shakespeare dialogue in a modern setting just does'nt work. It comes off as corny and cheesy. Any attempt to reinvent Shakespeare falls flat. The violence is excessive and comes off as more of a Grand Theft Auto game than anything Shakespeare could have done. The direction and editing is all over the place and it seems like Baz Luhrman did'nt know what to do with the camera. Visuals are put before the soul of the romance. This film tries so hard to be hip, cool, and badass that it loses grasp of the story and ends up with a disaster.

RomeoJuliet,Appalling,1/10,moller-553-415997,21/2/2012,"I found this film literally unwatchable--I put up with it for perhaps ten minutes and then could take no more. Shakespeare's play is among the greatest ever written in English, but it was utterly ruined by the action. It was Ode to Joy done by a screamo band; it was Swan Lake done by break dancers.

Shakespeare's plays tell a story in moving and powerful ways, one of the reasons they can be read with nearly as much pleasure as may be gotten by seeing them performed on stage. The language tells the story, not the props, not the scenery, not even, particularly, the actors. In this version of the play, the language is lost. The props, scenery, and action overwhelm it. The dialogue, in the mouths of these actors, in the situations in which they deliver it, is utterly malapropos.

I've no idea why Mr Luhrmann made this film, but, in doing so, he did no service to either Shakespeare nor to his audiences. It might be a bit much to call it a desecration of Shakespeare's work, but it's not far from it. It's a parody. It's La Gioconda done in crayon.",neg
RomeoJuliet,This Film SUCKS!,1/10,mccormick632,3/10/2011,"Oh my god, where do I begin with this movie? To put it bluntly, its the worst, most god-awful movie I have ever seen in my entire life! It's boring, its stupid, its everything that is wrong with adapting a play written hundreds of years ago into a modern setting.

Romeo + Juliet is a travesty, a mind-blowing awful attempt at legitimate cinema. It fails on every level: costumes, drama, characters, excitement, etc. Swords become guns, yet are still referred to as swords, the Capulets become a clichéd Mexican gang (or was that just Tybalt?) and yet somehow Juliet is not even remotely Hispanic. Romeo plays pool while smoking and uttering words like, ""thee,"" ""thy,"" and ""thou,"" which incidentally is one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in a film. It just bugs the heck out of me and I can't take the film seriously.

The story is classic but not here. The film puts the Romeo and Juliet story into a modern day setting, while still retaining the original script. Leading to the infamous scene which I mentioned previously, this also leads to some rather hilarious moments when characters are meant to have a dramatic moment yet still speak in traditional English dialect.

I hate this movie, so very, very much. I hate the idea, I hate the execution, I hate the sets, the costumes, everything. I hate it.

When writing his review of ""North,"" Roger Ebert finished his review with the now famous saying: ""I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it."" Couldn't have said it better myself.",neg
RomeoJuliet,When I see a bad movie in the future...,1/10,MarsBar101,13/5/2009,"...I can at least say that it's not as bad as Romeo and Juliet.

Now, I haven't been fortunate (unfortunate?) enough to see the classic bad movies such as ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but right now, this is the worst film I've ever seen.

My first thought was ""Is this a joke?"". Did somebody I know slap this together in a few hours just to mess with me? Eventually I realized some poor sod was actually insane enough to create this.

Basically, the film plays out as though some stupid kid who didn't understand the play decided it had to be cool and flashy to appeal to today's kids. The prologue flashes on-screen in the ridiculously cliché ""Blockbuster film"" title font. From there, the director shoehorns in references to the play as if to prove he actually read it (though I doubt he payed much attention). ""Prince"" the chief of police, Sword Mk 2 pistols, the list goes on. As a result, the film spends too much time saying ""Look! We figured out a way to modernize (blank)!"" and misses out on the important parts of the play, such as the statements on power, violence and money.

In summary, avoid.",neg
RomeoJuliet,The worst movie I have ever seen,1/10,bigmouth774,12/5/2009,"It is hard to believe this movie was ever made. I am guessing that Baz Luhrmanns reputation was the reason why, but this movie surely dinged that same reputation. I would shoot myself if I had invested in it. Why would anyone update the time/era of this masterpiece by William Shakespeare yet use 500 year old dialogue? If one has some issue with the work I wouldn't think it wasn't the time frame but rather the archaic language. This piece of trash gets it 100% incorrect. How can anyone be expected to find this combination useful is frankly beyond my ability to reason. Whatever possessed such a fine cast to be involved with this project is the question. Perhaps Claire Danes was too young to have a reputation strong enough to turn down this role, but no other actor in this garbage of a film has that excuse to fall back on. If you enjoy Ms Danes get a hold of her fantastic, and too good for TV, series ""My So Called Life"". I like John Leguizamo as much as anyone I believe, but casting him as an Italian stretches my imagination well past it's ability. In an act of delicious irony he dresses as a Puerto Rican for the ""ball"". Funny! I could only make it through 40 minutes of this film. If the truth were to be spoken.... this film makes Peyton Place(my former worst movie ever) look like a masterpiece. I would be embarrassed to be seen renting this movie. Save your money for a Porky's movie. As bad as they were they were three times the quality of this junk. Perhaps if you can enjoy 2 men playing pool, speaking Old English, in a pool hall where they have to check their 9mm's you could enjoy this. I thought it was ridiculous.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Why can I not go into negative numbers?!,1/10,lagriff05,11/8/2007,"Oh my dear lord. The crap has hit the fan now. This is rock bottom. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. This is what the sinners will be subjected to when they're dragged kicking and screaming down to Hell after the world freezes over. Quite simply, Romeo + Juliet is one of the worst movies ever vomited upon this Earth, and it completely defecates on any and all aspects of William Shakespeare's classic play. Let us begin the dissection, then:

I must stress how mind-numbingly stupid it is to make a modern, teenage romance/drama (especially an adaption of such a classic piece of literature), and keep in all of the 16th century dialogue. It's bad enough that they made it so nauseatingly queer in the first place, but that's just before you hear any of the characters talk. I shouldn't even have to waste time on why keeping the 16th century dialogue was a monumentally suck-tastic idea, but I'll just say that it makes everything incredibly awkward and messy. This is also partially due to the fact that they replaced the swords and daggers with loaded pistols, which look absolutely ridiculous in context with the storyline and plot. Also, what the hell is up with the characters walking around in Hawaiian button up shirts and khakis? Is this a joke?

The acting is...how to say this...awful. The actors on display might be talented, but you'd never know it from this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is extremely over the top and fake, and he manages to craft a marvelously whiny, intolerable little brat out of what was once a passionate young man stricken with tragedy, and he very much succeeds in making me want to murder him with a toothbrush in the most violent way possible. The other characters here are a bit closer to their original counterparts, but the acting is sub par and reeks of what you'd expect from a C-level porn flick instead of a romance drama.

In conclusion, this is a travesty of modern art, and Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave now. It's a testament to this film's stunning banality when I say the only movies that I've ever seen that were worse, were subhuman B-horror movies. This is truly the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen a lot of crappy movies. Never see this movie, and if you are ever presented with the option of seeing it, seize it with both hands and break it into many tiny pieces, laughing maniacally as you annihilate it from this world. Avoid, avoid like the plague.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Bastardization at it's most profound.,1/10,terrier42,31/1/2007,"I'll put it bluntly: This movie sucks. This movie really sucks. They didn't do a good job. Why? Well, they modernized it. Instead of swords, they have submachine guns with the word ""Longsword"" imprinted upon it. They did a rubbish job. How did they work in hallucinogens into the story? Why modern? WHY? They made Mercutio some sort of gay guy. That's what I got from it. And they cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo. They changed Benvolio's name to...Benevelo. And to top things off, they used the original language from the play. I HATE INCONSISTENCY. They watch TV in the middle of a beach. TV. ON A BLOODY BEACH! And Mercutio's death was handled absolutely terribly. And they called Paris ""Dave Paris"". DAVE? Instead of continuing on with how bad this movie is, I'll just say this: This movie is the worst bastardization of Shakespeare. Ever. Thank you. -100/10",neg
RomeoJuliet,Mockering Shakespeare,1/10,venus1231,1/10/2006,"I saw this film very long time ago, but I still remember this time. It was Monday, as far I can remember, I had a plenty of problems and felt terribly and thought that such a romantic film can improve my mood a bit. I like W. Shakespeare very much, read R+J before, so I was completely astounded by what the director made of this perfect tragedy. He moved the action from Verona to nowadays America and much of the original texts lost their sense. Many of the personage are cartoons of their selves. Only Leguizamo was trying to act, the others were telling their words without any passion. I like C.Danes and DiCaprio but they don't come up to each other. She is not such beautiful, in my opinion, as real Juliet should be.

RomeoJuliet,Total Crap,1/10,toransu,22/9/2006,"I have many problems with this movie. One, the dialog. Even though it was supposed to make it unique, having Shakespearian dialog during the more serious scenes completely ruins the feel of it, as I was finding myself laughing when they were trying to be serious, but were failing miserably when you had these supposedly 'hip' people speaking as if they were from the 1500's. The producers should have modernized the dialog, and expanded on it, like in the video game industry, when translating from Japanese to English. Add pop culture references, and try to connect with the audiences, don't make what is one of the masterpieces of English literature turn into this pile of Garbage. Secondly, the cinematography was awful. Usually you can see the differences between movies made in the 1960's and 1990's, but when I saw the 60's version, it came out looking as if it was recently made, not made 40 years ago.

RomeoJuliet,This movie collides with you. You will love it,10/10,im-mr-e-mann,29/7/2006,"This movie is dramatic. That's Romeo and Juliet in full. This movie is so clever, as you watch it it makes you wriggle in your boots in admiration. The actors are innocent and young. It's a Red Curtain Movie without a doubt; its drama, love theme, passion, but in some parts its pure quirkyness and 'feel good' moments are all perfected. For instance, it starts off with something similar to an ad for the movie which is entirely unique.

When I first saw this movie I was hesitant as it start; you may find that, the Shakespeare language may seem unfitting and unusual, but by seeing this movie you'll get hooked. Make sure you see this movie without the following; the dog barking, people running around and yelling, the lights on. I've seen this movie over 5 times and become more liking it every second. If you think some other movies are sad, get ready to hide the tears at the end of this one; I've never come close to crying in any movie I've seen (and I've seen a lot of movies) but this one was the exception. I nearly bawled. It deserves more than 10 out of 10. 15 out of 10 wouldn't even by close. You will love it.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Wonderful (and overlooked) Shakespeare Adaptation,9/10,sgtdiscoming,20/7/2006,"As a teenager who has had a love affair with film all of his life and who is a great admirer of Shakespeare, I must state that Baz Luhrmann's film version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is one of the most important films of both the 1990s and in Shakespearean culture. It is also a great romance film (think of it as a Titanic for literature enthusiasts). The reason I say that is because it made Shakespeare as entertaining to see in a new generation as it was back in the 1600s. One must admit, that to an average teenager (or person, for that matter), Shakespeare is as boring as reading a tax filing instruction book. With the language and ""iambic pentameter"" (a rhythmic way of speaking with five beats for each line of Shakespeare, which is something conservative Shakespeare scholars hold dear) Shakespeare can sound like clapping with one hand. However, with Baz's creativity and style, R+J is one of the most entertaining adaptations of Shakespeare ever put on film. From the dazzling visuals to the working chemistry between Leo and Claire, Shakespeare is made fun again.

A lot of people knock this version for its extreme over-the-top style and the changing of the simplest elements (changing swords to guns, use of rock music), but to make a hit, that's what you have to do to get your point across. Sure, most of the text is cut and some plot elements from the original is left out, but that does not change the true story by much (you think a teenager would want to sit through the WHOLE play on film?). You have to admit, Shakespeare's not easy to translate to the screen, so one must give Baz a lot of credit for trying and succeeding. Sure its bawdy, violent and over the top, but that's his style. You can't blame a director for using his own style to make an entertaining film. And the way he updates the details to match the era is fantastic (usage of cars, gun handling, Mercutio as a drag queen, Queen Mab as a drug, Prince as a cop, etc.). A lot of people knock the simplest changes, most often touched upon being the swords-to-guns controversy. Think about it: your living in the 1990s, who's going to carry a sword? And while there are wonderful qualities, the negative ones must be briefly touched upon. The language is sometimes spoken without any sort of rhythm at all (I'm not knocking it for not using iambic pentameter, but since Shakespeare is poetic, treat it like it is poetry) and is sometimes spoken as if it were slang. Some of the actors handle it very nicely, and some just crash and burn. I must say, that I bet there were many teens in the audience scratching their heads at what everybody was talking about, but I think it's good for people to listen to movies and not just watch them. One thing I was personally annoyed by was the use of that song ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". It's used once in the first scene, then used again ten minutes later in a scene with the same exact people. Is that all they listen to? Other than that, there are not many negative elements to touch upon.

*SPOILER WARNING*Some of the scenes are absolutely spectacular. The gas station scene is wonderfully cartoonish as it mimics a spaghetti-Western shootout, the first encounters between Romeo and Juliet are beautifully done (especially the elevator scene and the pool scene), and the rewritten final scene between Romeo and Juliet is convincing and tragic (and convincingly tragic). I was so into that scene that I was sort of yelling at the screen for Juliet to make a move to Romeo faster in order to show that she's alive. It's little things like those that helps you know how convincing the romance is between the two, and overall it was an extremely powerful and moving scene. The performances from the two are great, as well as Mercutio, Tybalt (who is played by an extremely badass Leguizamo), Friar, Nurse and Prince. This is one of my favorite films, both from the 1990s and of all time, and I hope that in the future, many more people will discover it the way I did.",pos
RomeoJuliet,this movie was hilarious...for the wrong reasons,1/10,gsjenkins,17/7/2006,"I saw this movie in English class after we just finished reading the play. Instead of saying that was a good movie, I was laughing my head off for ten minutes, and so was the rest of my class. Why? Because the old English lines did not fit the modernized movie. When you put two-and-two together, watching a stand-up comedian will provide you with the same laughs out of this movie. Now let me point out the tings that I thought were ridiculous. The actors don't use swords, which is key to the time that the original play is set. Instead they use guns, security cameras, helicopters and cars. You're looking at this and saying to yourself, ""No way! CARS?!"" Now how is Mercutio going to die? If you read the original play he is stabbed by Tybalt (with a sword). In the movie Tybalt breaks a piece of glass and impales him. The funniest scene is the deaths of Romeo and Juliet. Romeo drinks a vial with Juliet awake for at least two minutes before. Romeo makes this ""Oh crap"" face after seeing Juliet wake up. Juliet then shoots her brains out. And thats the end of the movie.

RomeoJuliet,Wake up it's the 20th century!,1/10,hagaren_no_chibi,4/7/2006,"So my English class and I just finished watching the '68 version of Romeo and Juliet and then we had to compare it with this modernized version. I was excited to watch this version since I thought it would be good. I'm sorry, but it sucked.

This version of Romeo and Juliet kept bugging me. So is Luhrmann trying to say that in modern day Verona, people can just carry guns around and start shooting and the law isn't charged upon them? And the citizens don't care that their local gas station is on fire? Another thing: Hello Romeo and Juliet OPEN your eyes and look around. Oh my gosh, your NOT in Renaissance Italy! Your in modernized-and-updated Verona! There's money! There's cars! There's passports! And airplanes were invented nearly a century ago!

Consider those facts. This movie shouldn't have used the olden language. Baz should've changed the script. I would be amazed if Verona beach boys with pink hair started to say thee's and thou's.",neg
RomeoJuliet,"a ""modern"" version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet",3/10,superangel226,3/2/2006,"This movie was atrocious. The only reason it received a 3 was because of Leonardo Dicaprio. Honestly, what is the point of putting in original dialect? It completely clashes with the modern setting and dress. If my guess is correct, the modernization of the play was to appeal to those of a younger generation, yet, when coupled with the original Shakespearean dialect, the viewers have no way of understanding what the actors were saying. This is the entire reason schoolbook versions have definitions of each different phrase or word that might be misleading or confusing. Claire Danes isn't actually THAT great of an actress, nor pretty enough to put beside Leo as the leads. This movie is a complete disappointment and you should never ever watch it if you know what's good for you.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare put to shame,3/10,the_munchkin,25/5/2005,"This movie leaves far to be desired for those who cherish the brilliant works of William Shakespeare. If Shakespeare was to sit down and watch this film, he would feel deceived. This movie takes a brilliant classic and destroys it with a poor attempt to modernize. This movie takes fantastic characters that the world has cherished for centuries and makes them hollow and blank. Finally, this movie takes excellent and thrilling scenes and destroys them, jumping from one idea to another without smooth transitions. For those who have never read Romeo and Juliet, this movie will be confusing and misleading. For those who have read Romeo and Juliet, this movie will be inadequate and appalling.

RomeoJuliet,Beach boys speaking Shakespeare... how weird is that?,5/10,pyrocitor,7/4/2005,"William Shakespeare's classic play is updated to a modern context, but still using the original, Old English text. It's a bold move on the part of director Baz Luhrmann, who brings a hyperkinetic, choppy editing style to the film, as if to never let the viewers catch their breaths. And for the most part, using the modern day context works, helping to clarify what some of the more tricky lines actually mean by showing it in familiar circumstances which audiences can identify with.

Despite the fact that the relationship of the two lovers, who were doomed not to last together is the focus of the movie, neither lover gives a very strong or charismatic performance. DiCaprio makes a good enough Romeo, although he seems to be content to coast along on his looks and fame, and doesn't invest much energy into creating a well developed character. Claire Danes is miscast, and out of place. She makes a dull, uninteresting Juliet, putting next to no energy into the role, as if she would rather not be there at all. She seems to struggle delivering her Shakespearian lines, not to mention giving little sense that she has any idea what she's saying at all. It's sad that the lovers, the center of the film, couldn't find a way to act more enthusiastic and involving. Because so much of the movie focuses on their drab relationship, the film drags in many parts. (although Luhrmann seems determined to throw in a gunfight after every intimate scene just to stop audiences from nodding off in their seats)

The supporting characters are where performances improve, letting the scenes with characters other than the two lovers present much more interesting. John Leguizamo makes a wonderfully vicious Tybalt, yet has the insight to occasionally give an uncertain look in the midst of cheap fighting and evil deeds, as if he is unsure what he is doing is morally right. Pete Posthlewaite is a high point of casting; his gruff but kind Friar Lawrence is wonderfully acted, and he manages to make clear what he is saying, even to those who might not understand Shakespearian dialect. Harold Perrineau makes a flamboyant Mercutio, unafraid of dressing in women's clothing to attract attention, or go on a twenty minute long tirade (that's an exaggeration, but only slightly, Mercutio goes on forever!) without actually saying anything of importance.

It was an interesting idea, and the modern day context for the most part works, helping audiences to identify with the circumstances, even if it does seem a little odd to see beach boys with pink hair and Hawaiian shirts spouting Shakespearian dialog. But Luhrmann's jumpy, incredibly energetic film style, combined with his seeming determination to turn the classic romance into an action movie, with numerous gunfights, gets tiring, and eventually deters more than complements the film. And with two dull, uninteresting performances from the lovers, the focus of the film, it's no surprise that despite Luhrmann's unquenchable energy, the film drags on and fails to retain interest.

RomeoJuliet,"Great movie, classic, needs to be seen",7/10,esshor,13/1/2005,"Romeo and Juliet, helmed by ""Strictly Ballroom""'s director Baz Luhrmann, is the Gen-X-John-Woo-MTV-school-of-film-making interpretation of the Bard's work. From the opening sequence of a television followed by a kinetic in-yer-face staccato of imagery, to the softer ballet-like camera work of the passion scenes between the two protagonists, R&J is definitely cinema of cool.

Instead of being a costume drama set in the 15th century, R&J is transposed to modern-day Verona Beach. However, Luhrmann has also thrown in some anachronistic elements from the original setting of R&J: instead of carrying swords, the members of the houses of Montague and Capulet carry 9mm semi-automatics, emblazoned with brand names such as ""Sword"" or ""Rapier"". Dialogue is faithful to the text in most respects (even the newscasters on the televisions in this anachronistic world speak in Elizabethan tongues). The church plays a prominent role in the modern-day Verona Beach, and the film is replete with religious imagery-- the young Juliet, instead of posters of New Edition on her wall, has a Madonna statue and Victorian images of angels; a large statue of Christ stands overlooking the city of Verona Beach; the guns which the Montagues and the Capulets carry are decorated with images of religious icons. Luhrmann also throws in little references that add some humour to the story: the Romeo 'n the boyz hang out at the Globe Theatre, a church choir breaks out into a hymnlike ""When Doves Cry"", and a Coca Cola ad is distorted to fit the Elizabethan atmosphere.

If there is anything to complain about, it would be the opening half hour of the film. Luhrmann throws everything but the kitchen sink in terms of film-making techniques, which can be overwhelming. You have Peckinpah-ish use of slow-motion, MTV-inspired rapid-fire editing with odd zoom-ins and outs, almost-slapstick use of speed-up sequences (a la ""The Gods Must be Crazy""), a retro-seventies look in terms of colourful costume design (not unlike the retro-seventies look of ""Strictly Ballroom"") and subtitling, and a retro-eighties feel in terms of the over-acting by the supporting characters. However, once you pass this odd jumble of imagery and get into the story of Romeo and Juliet, the machine-gun barrage slows down to a more manageable pace.

In summary, R&J adds value by putting the play into a different context, and through the use of interesting symbolism and imagery, adds a whole new level of interpretation to this timeless classic. Definitely a must-see (and don't mind the teenyboppers sitting around you-- they just have an essay on R&J due next week for Grade 10 English).

Great movie, classic, needs to be seen. Great emotion and passion into the actors portrayal and the music used to open up the storyline. Yet one question remains; is 'Romeo and Juliet' the greatest love story ever told?",pos
RomeoJuliet,Not for Shakespeare beginners... or anyone else for that matter,7/10,scifisuede,2/1/2005,"It's dangerous to expose someone who has never read Shakespeare to this film - so if you haven't, but you're crazy about Leonardo DiCaprio, try to read the book first before watching this piece of bizarre rendition - or, after you watch it, immediately read the book with open mind.

It may not be fair coming from me because I'm not a DiCaprio fan, but I think he's not the right lead actor. He's just *not* Romeo. Danes on the other hand is doing brilliantly as Juliet, and she's the only one close to making her Shakespearean lines believable in this weird MTV-style chaos of 'modern Verona'. The whole combination is just too absurd - I can't imagine how they decided on which parts of the amazing love story to destroy and revamp, and which parts to preserve - but it just doesn't work.

Think someone destroying parts of Colosseum and replacing those random parts with steel, glass, and colourful paints. You just don't do such thing!

If you love sparkling visuals like this, see Moulin Rouge instead - there, Luhrmann successfully mixed all his eccentric elements into one stunning musical. If you love Shakespeare, try 1968's Romeo and Juliet instead - it makes much more sense and is less of an insult to this great work of Shakespeare. And... if you love DiCaprio, you might as well watch Titanic instead.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Good concept in part, bad execution",3/10,heilborn,1/3/2004,"I love Shakespeare made relevant through modern dress, etc., but the attempt to make Shakespeare's poetry sound ""conversational"" just didn't work for me. Nobody I know speaks conversationally in iambic pentameter. The language begs for a more stylized delivery. I did like many of the sets and the ""rival gang"" flavor however. The helicoptors and car chases were dramatic and something that I could easily accept as something Shakespeare might have included if he had written the play in the current era. I can see why many people enjoyed this film. I just couldn't accept Shakespeare's language in modern conversational tones. It made the acting seem abysmal in places and totally unbelievable throughtout. It often seemed as if the actors had no idea of the meaning of the words they spoke. I'm sure this was not true, but the delivery made it seem so.

RomeoJuliet,It deserves credit for it's style alone.,7/10,Boba_Fett1138,19/2/2004,"""Romeo + Juliet"" is a daring movie. The idea of making a ""hip"" version of the classic Shakespeare story set in present time might sound strange and like a bad idea to say the last. However it works surprising well and effective and for this alone the movie and director Baz Luhrmann deserve credit.

The power of the movie is in the unique style. It seems unusually in the beginning but once you are used to it you will notice how wonderful it works and makes the movie in a way an unique visual little masterpiece with wonderful sets and costumes.

The acting is good. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino are great. Also the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes is good and makes the love story work. There is a real spark between those two.

Still the movie has it's flaws and at times the style is simply too much and too weird and to be honest the movie is a bit too short.

Not a great movie but watchable and recommendable for its style alone.

RomeoJuliet,"Passioned, deep and fine romance",6/10,EijnarAmadeus,5/9/2003,"ROMEO + JULIET (1996) spoilers((( My personal oppinion of Leonardo DiCaprio is, he isn't a bad actor at all. Here he does a good performance (he also does very good performances in Catch Me If you can, Titanic, Gilbert Grape and Gangs of NY, though The Beach was a bommer.

William Shakespeare's most famous play has been filmed dozens of times, but this is the most peculiar one. This is the modern version of the classical romance - story about two who falls secretely in love. Its wonderful to listen and watch this movie threw very good soundtrack and nice performances, especially from DiCaprio that is. Its romantic, sensual and charming to watch them look at each other threw the aquarium, its a very lovely film! And Baz Luhrmann has also tricked into action scenes, pretty much dramatic and excitement surprisingly enough. The last scene is fantastic when Romeo takes a guy to hostage and starts firing at the cops, it's with other words spellbounding and very entertaining.

STORY: Known by almost everyone. The Capulet family and the Montague family has always been and are still rivals, under a party the Montague's son Romeo falls in love with the Capulet's daughter Juliet and they secretely sets a marriage in the night. At the same time a war is tensing between the two families...

If you have nor heard or seen the Romeo & Juliet play, this is a good example of the play, though it isn't the original. The weak part of the movie is when its too special and weird for me, as when this black fellow dresses up in women clothes, it gets to weird to me. But, do not be afraid, this is a very good movie.

RomeoJuliet,kitsch updating of the Bard,6/10,didi-5,17/6/2003,"This new and lively version takes a bit of getting used to, as the opening few minutes are in the style of a fast-moving, MTV style, news report, on gang warfare in Verona.

Against this backdrop are Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Danes, both doing their best with the staring and sloshing around their characters have to do. Neither can speak the verse brilliantly, although both manage to be effective, perhaps because they have youth and beauty on their side.

In support are Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite, and others. All adequate.

But the best things in this Romeo and Juliet have nothing to do with Shakepeare. First, there's the music - a lovely theme for when the lovers first meet, a drag performance for Mercutio with the disco classic Young Hearts Run Free, a church choir singing When Doves Cry - and the gorgeous visuals (the final sequences are in a shining gold palace of kitsch, there's a fishtank with lovely coloured fish, there's a large pool which helps move the balcony scene along ...).

The acting was pretty good, but not great, they couldn't really flow with the old english language of shakespeare with the exception of Father Lawrence. It had it's moments but for the most part the movie was just terrible, don't waste your time. My rating - 3/10

RomeoJuliet,"William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""? No, Baz's ""Romeo + Juliet"".",10/10,mercybell,2/11/2002,"I remember when this movie came out, all my classmates were seeing it and talking about it, my school got free book covers with Leonardo and Clare until I could hardly stand their faces any more, and I was greatly surprised to hear my chorus teacher give it rave reviews, it was after all, a teen flick, right? But even though I had a great curiosity regarding such a strange movie, I didn't see it. It wasn't till after I had seen Moulin Rouge that I took the initiative to see this film.

I find it fairly amusing that the ""official"" title of this film is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", everyone and their uncle knows who wrote it. Everyone and their uncle knows the story. Quite frankly, when I saw it, I was expecting to be bored. I knew how it went, I had read it twice, I had been hearing the story in every vessel of artistic interpretation all my life, from Zeffirelli to Bernstein (well, I love West Side Story). It had been played out, there's only so much mileage you can get. And to me it wasn't Hamlet or King Lear or Much Ado about Nothing which still could hold you enthralled just by a reading. ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet""? What else is new? Sure it's genius, but now, quite simply, it was boring. But this isn't simply Shakespeare's movie, it's Baz Luhrmann's. It made me weep.

Where you might think a hip and slick take on a timeless story has been played out, it has elsewhere, but not here. Luhrmann infuses something into it. The film is at times bizarre and sinister, it's intense, it's rough and awkward, it's colorful and crazy and over the top, it's muted, it's passion frenzy, it's dry, it's slick and sophisticated. It's meticulous and strange and cold and white hot all at once. He shoves it all into Venice Beach and actors and those so very famous beautiful poetic lines and mixed with a complete and total disregard for convention.

Like Moulin Rouge, there's an obsession with details. But these are strange details. Guns with names, palaces and servants for these mafialike characters, beaches and highways and gas stations as playgrounds for the characters. It's a deformed and crazy Verona for '96. The background is filled to the brim with every sort of lavish and extravagant window or bookshelf dressing or religious icon, flowers, car wheel caps, clothing styles, the way hedges are trimmed, and billboards. Nothing is left out. Luhrmann immerses you into another world, it's 1996, but it's not where we're living. Thus we can relate to these people yet still accept this insanity. And that's fitting, the world Shakespeare was evoking wasn't his own secular society either, he was trying to strip it down to the human qualities of a story.

That's why a modern American plain accented actor speaking this complicated dialogue works. We're allowed to believe that these people would talk like this. And the actors give it life and a palpability. It's excellently casted. They give every line with emotion, they act it out, using themselves, but realistically. Danes and Dicaprio are excellent. The various supports do great justice to their roles. It was a joy and a wonder to watch, to see what Shakespeare had intended, with good actors performing well on such a colorful and wacky stage.

Above all the emotional power of the story, which can be beaten out during mandatory reading periods or a repeated session with a bland and average version again and again, remains firm. Especially during the last part of the film. There are no superfluous motions or gestures on the actors' part. They act it to a tee. Baz leaves no emotion or possibility unturned. The blocking and directing gets the best out of the story. For example: Romeo walks through a dazzling and dark candlelit and flower and statue strewn chapel to find Juliet, and he weeps and weeps while saying his lines. This is the imagery and interpretation that flows throughout the movie.

This is a movie that had a lot of effort and thought and heart and honesty put into it. It has a character and a charisma that I think is lacking in many films today. No one has ever seen the version Shakespeare envisioned, he doesn't give staging or actor's notes, he didn't provide a cliffsnotes version. No one alive can pass down the directions to a performance Shakespeare was present at. Taking this into consideration, Luhrmann created a respectful yet completely unique and enlightening spin on a story that no matter how brilliant, can still get botched by poor translation. I think he extracted the essence of a timeless and beautiful story, and made something incredible. At least he finally made me appreciate it.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Pretty Darned Good,6/10,starc-2,25/7/2000,"OK, warning. If you've never seen/read Romeo and Juliet, this will contain spoilers. Since the play is--oh, I don't know, 400 years old?--I don't think this warning is really necessary, but I don't want to get ""blacklisted"" for not warning you!

Baz Luhrmann's updated version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet seems to be a movie which inspires viewers to extremes--all the reviews I have heard are either ""love it"" reviews or ""hate it"" reviews. I propose to take the middle road. I don't think that the film is a piece of trash, as Ye Olde Shakespeare Fans tend to brand it. I also don't think it's the greatest thing since Zeffirelli. The main thing here is not to compare Luhrmann's vision to Zeffirelli's--or to any traditional performance of the play. Take it by itself, and it's actually pretty decent. There are, however, some places where you can't help but notice that Romeo's murder of Tybalt isn't quite the same when it's done in a car chase, or that the lovers' deaths are more tragic, or that you can't seem to recall the families reconciling in this version... All in all, good to see for a change of pace, but don't make it your definitive version of Romeo and Juliet.",pos
RomeoJuliet,MTV does Shakespeare,4/10,Tetsel,30/11/1999,"What a sad day it is when the Capulets destroy gas stations and Romeo smokes cigarettes. This new version, in a poor imitation of the 'MTV cross-cutting' style, makes a terrible mess of Shakespeare's classic. The direction is a joke, the editing is ridiculous, and the actors are vacant of any comprehension of the characters. In other words, this is pure trash. See Zeffirelli's 1968 version instead.

RomeoJuliet,READ THE PLAY!,3/10,CanadianBeaver,11/9/1999,"This is my message to director Baz Lhurman. Shakespeare's text is studied in high school english for good reason...there is DEPTH! I don't think the director knows what a tragic flaw is, and even if he did, did he make any effort to present that? Advertisements for this movie always spoke to the 'star crossed lovers' aspect. Once again I wonder does Baz know what FATE is?

I won't say something subjective like: DeCaprio was great or DeCaprio stank. I say objectively that his raw emotion that he brought to the screen was excellent, but this emotion does not replace understanding for the lines he's saying (i.e. he had no understanding of the lines he was saying). The director is the one responsible for this lack of comprehension... if you're going to do shakespeare, you have to know what it is you're talking about.

To be blunt this movie was the worst interpretation of shakepeare's play that I have ever witnessed. Shame on Baz that he botched it so badly. My advice to him is READ THE PLAY!",neg

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare Goes Modern I See,10/10,IrisNo11,30/7/1999,"William Shakespeare is one of my favorite writers of all time. He was a true master at what he did, and his work featured every element: Romance, drama, comedy, fantasy, you name it! And it's not a big surprise that his work is made into films. I've seen two versions of Romeo and Juliet in film. One was the one starring Oliva Hussey (Juliet)and Leonard Whiting (Romeo) which dates back to 1968, and this one starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines.

I liked both versions at the same level, because they are both great in their own ways. In this case, this one takes place in modern time. For example, Verona, Italy is now Verona Beach, and the Prince is head of a police squad. The famous balcony scene takes place in a swimming pool, and there are guns rather than swords and daggers.

I loved this version of the classic play by Shakespeare, not only because it's more up to date, but because it is creative and besides the modern elements added to this film, not one thing changed compared to the original play (unlike what they did to ""Great Expectations"" starring Ethan Hawke, which is a disappointment)! An excellent piece of work and a true masterpiece!!! :o)",pos
RomeoJuliet,I defy you rating stars,7/10,Darkside-Reviewer,12/10/2019,"I first saw this movie in highschool while studying Shakespeare in English literature and I was blown away by it's modernised visuals without compromising the original text such as switching swords for guns and having each one inscribed with the name of the blade in the text Tybalts gun is inscribed with Rapier on it Mercutios is inscribed with dagger so when they put up there swords to fight no text or dialogue is changed just the visuals while the movies modern theme's give this classic story a different interpretation while not changing the original text.

There are a few scenes that are a bit weird such as Mercutio cross dressing for the party at the Capulet mansion and Romeo dropping acid and having bad trip at the party but honestly they don't take away from the movies seriousness they just add a bit of comedy and weirdness to an otherwise great movie.

The story is exactly the same as in the book word for word the only difference being having visuals to illustrate the scenes and bring it to life like on stage in a play with a much bigger budget and the advantage of movie editing for the best performances and even when you know how the movie is going to play out and how it will end it still surprises you.

The cast do an amazing job of bringing the characters to life breathing new life into them Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes have great chemistry on screen and really bring the star crossed lovers story of true love to a modern audience also notably John Leguizamo plays Tybalt and really he does a great job at bringing this classic villain to life with a cunning and evil voice and stylish movements worthy of the name prince of cats.

I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys this classic story of love and loss or just as a romantic love movie.",pos

RomeoJuliet,It's a well developed film.,7/10,tsunnar,14/6/2019,"I think that the movie was very well designed but not for my audience. I think that this movie is aimed at an older audience because there is a lot of terms new generations wouldn't understand. In my eyes the movie was very boring and the scenes had no backstory. I can tell by the design of the film, that for different audiences it can be shown as strong and powerful in the emotions and is good at keeping older audiences engaged. I think this film would be better if the scenes had more character description. Personally I think the film accurately produced a clash of new and old with the way the Shakespearian language but there are still cars and higher tech. Also, all the characters speak fluently and act flawlessly almost like it wasn't scripted and the costumes are well designed as they show the difference between lower and higher class. I also think that the film was very effective as it has mood dependent music per scene. My personal favourite part was when the bad guys come to the beach because it's like a Wild West stand-off. But my least favourite was when they were in the water because it was unclear what was happening. Furthermore the part that stuck out to me the most was when the person who Juliet was meant to marry comes in because it shows Juliet's emotions.",pos

But this works. They're lucid about what they're doing, it's deliberately explosive and zany and always visually interesting.

It's funny, strange, hypnotic and (pretentious motifs aside) really does whip up powerful feelings for its main characters.

Watch Franco Zefferelli's version first of course but once you're familiar with the text THEN give this a try.

RomeoJuliet,"""These times of woe afford no time to woo.""",8/10,classicsoncall,12/7/2018,"The passage of time has not been kind to this film as far as IMDb's rating system goes. But can you picture the love struck couples who went to see this in the theater when it was originally released? I can just imagine the weeping that occurred at the end of the story, teenage girls clutching their boyfriends' arms in shocked and swollen grief. Ah yes, the saga of Romeo and Juliet.

I actually had a pretty good time with this flick and I'm not really a Shakespeare buff. The modern day updating has a weird sensibility to it, pitting two warring families against each other - the Montagues and the Capulets. The only thing is, it's never really mentioned what started the feud off in the first place. It seemed kind of senseless, and appeared to be almost ethnic in nature, something I don't think will ever be overcome by people who see others as different from themselves. Shakespearean dialog in the hands of these hip-hop oriented thespians sounds oddly anachronistic, but serves well, especially during the comedic moments. I got the biggest kick out of the Montagues 'biting their thumbs' at the Capulets. I don't know if that was in the original play but I thought that scene was hilarious.

Leonardo DiCaprio is far from a favorite of mine but he did a decent job here as Romeo, as did Claire Danes as Juliet. I'm pretty sure Shakespeare would not have envisioned Romeo in a shootout with the cops near the story's finale, nor would he have envisioned much of what else goes on in this latter day tale set in Verona Beach, with players attired in Hawaiian shirts and gang-banger threads coming at each other. But the essence of Romeo and Juliet is there, and if you've been predisposed to ignore the famous bard, a picture like this might just have you picking up a copy of Shakespeare.",pos

RomeoJuliet,"Thou may enjoy thy film, but I won't.",6/10,mcfarlanejjm,23/3/2017,"Based on the original screenplay by William Shakespeare, Romeo + Juliet attempts to take more of a modern approach to the film, but in my opinion fails to deliver. Don't get me wrong, some aspects of the film were at most ""meh"", but I found the film bizarre and also scrappily put together. Don't get me wrong people will still find enjoyment out of this film depending on their taste, but I just found this to be a somewhat weak comedy with a few scenes of romance.

The plot: very similar if not just an adaptation of the original screenplay. There isn't much to say here, apart from the fact that they more or less used all the original lines from Shakespeare's classic. This is very interesting and it's nice that they experimented with this, despite making the film even more confusing as I constantly try to decide whether this film is based in the past or the present.

The characters seem to be relatively corny and while they have their dialog to characterize them which actually lets them stand out from the minor characters, they also have a sort of comedic twist to them (seriously how is this not a comedy?). A good example of this is Mercutio. At the start of the film, he was wearing bizarre clothes, and I'm not joking when I say that I thought his character was supposed to be a reference to how women didn't act in Shakespearian times, as it was thought to be ""unladylike"". The characters themselves were executed relatively fine; nothing more, nothing less.

The music used a blend of classic songs with more late 90s songs. While this was an interesting mix, this somehow worked. With the tone of the film being fairly light hearted and cheesier then dark and edgy on some scenes, the songs worked to make it feel like a parody of Romeo and Juliet. I still don't know if it is a parody or not, but I can't be bothered to research it.

Overall, this film was decent at most and also bizarre and annoying at most. At the end I kept screaming ""JUST LOOK DOWN ROMEO OH MY GOD"", before Romeo was about to poison himself. I found this moment unrealistic, as if you're going to show the character die, don't make them start to wake up in that moment and instead wake up as Romeo is dying, unless this was intentional of course, so good job on that. Overall, I found this film at most funny and at least corny. I'd give this film a 6/10.",pos

RomeoJuliet,A modern movie with archaic dialogues does not work.,5/10,filipemanuelneto,9/2/2017,"Changing or using material from Shakespeare always requires courage and maturity. He's just the greatest British playwright of all time. Baz Luhrmann had this courage and much more, in a film that updates the most famous love story ever, bringing it to our time, to a great seaside town. This may displease the purists but its not original. This has happened to other stories by other authors. However, this film has the characteristic of keeping, almost in full, the original dialogues of Shakespeare. I confess that I really enjoyed listening to them, but there is a natural nasty discrepancy between the Renaissance text and the modern environment, they disagree with each other for the most obvious reasons and this damages the film. If the idea was to bring the story to modern times the most natural solution would have been to adapt the dialogues, but if the option were to keep Shakespeare's text untouched, the best would be a period film. Mixing both concepts did not work out.

The film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles. DiCaprio was still enjoying his stage as a ""handsome movie boy"", while Danes was just a beautiful unknown face to a Juliet who wanted to be naive and young. In fact, this actress employed very little in this film beyond her physical beauty, for she always sounded unconvincingly and never really seemed to be in love. The scenarios are quite curious and full of exaggerations. The Capulet house could be the mansion of any new-wealthy businessman, with its tacky décor and kitsch furnishings. These elements are also visible in the family mausoleum, with all the candles and neon crosses. In the middle of all, Danes and DiCaprio stand out for the sobriety of their costumes. Harold Perrineau probably gives us the most controversial performance, turning Mercutio into an African-American transvestite, full of glitter. Pete Postlethwaite did quite well as Father Laurence, as Miriam Margoyles in the maid role. The soundtrack wisely uses some pieces of classical music, but this doesn't harmonize with the modern pieces that were used as well.",neg
RomeoJuliet,A nice update on a classic tale,10/10,venoxben,8/1/2017,"This was a interesting film to watch a mix of new visuals and old English and the use of updating things that allowed to keep the same language like the Swords to the Sword as the name brand of the guns were genius. This telling of a old story with new elements as the fight between the two houses was updated to be a fight between to family companies and the wonderful prince being the police captain. Over all this is one of the most creative movies I have seen in a while a nice retell of a old story that everyone knows to a seemly different story that had lots of little differences that created a wonderfully updated and whimsical story but still had the classic feel of Romeo and Juliet which of course means it's incredibly sad and even though we know the ending it's still a fun ride to the end.

RomeoJuliet,Weird,6/10,jiosongjs,17/11/2016,"I felt very weird from the very beginning of the movie when they had this character introduction. It was my first movie that showed the character introduction in a movie. It felt more like a TV show rather than a movie. I really didn't like this movie because the style is very different from other movies and it is very overacted.

I really don't like the story style where this director put Shakespeare's work into a modern world. I think it's special, unique and nice try but I feel like it was way too much. Putting Shakespeare's work into modern society made the whole movie so awkward. Also, having the same script as the original wasn't a great idea, because it all seemed so awkward and foolish.

Also the actors are kind of very overacting. I feel that their acting should be less overacting because in modern days, overacting isn't something that is normal. Because of the overacting, I feel like the whole movie became so awkward and crazy. I really didn't like it and it is not my type. However, some of the actors were Good, such as Decaprio, so I think...I gave 6. For it's uniqueness and some good actors.",neg

It was tragic when the two killed themselves over each other. It became a sad movie when that happened, and i wish that the movie could've had a happy ending. It was an overall good movie. I enjoyed it. i hope that we can watch more movies like this. The movie was good in some parts but i didn't like the part where the man hit juliet in her face. And i did like the fact that the movie was set in a modern time but i didn't like the way that they still talked in the old fashion way and i also didn't like the fact that they used guns instead of swords.

RomeoJuliet,"A Disappointment When Compared to the Play, But Not Too Bad",7/10,nmholland,1/3/2016,"Romeo + Juliet is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the famous star-crossed lovers and title characters, Romeo and Juliet. If you don't know the story, shame on you, but here's a synopsis. Two families, the Montagues and Capulets, are constantly feuding, and Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet, subsequently fall in love. Their love is not allowed, due to their parents' hatred for each other, and so they secretly get married. This entire story is based (literally line by line) off of William Shakespeare's play, The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.

The best thing this film has to offer is, quite obviously, the dialogue. The lines used in this film is the exact lines William Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century. The plot, along with the dialogue, is ingenious. The forbidden love between the two plays off amazingly. The direction in this film also is pretty good. It has a few flaws; some shaky cam, bad close ups, etc. However, it's more good than it is bad. The acting is also really good. This is one of DiCaprio's first roles, besides What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), in which he received his first Oscar nomination. He is super young here, but still does a great job. Claire Danes does great as well. She's not in many movies (thanks to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)), but she really should be. She does fantastic in this film. The first negative in this film is the ""gangster"" vibe of it. The original story takes place in the 14th century in Verona, Italy. This film takes place in 1996 in Verona Beach, California. Nobody uses swords; they all use engraved, golden guns. This movie would've been near perfect if the director kept to the formula that Shakespeare wrote. The nowaday feel of the movie makes for a complete mess, with too much unnecessary drama at the wrong times, and confusing dialogue that makes no sense when a character says the word ""sword"" or especially old English, using words like ""doth"" and ""thou.""

Overall, Romeo + Juliet wasn't too bad. I expected better than the utterly stupid theme of the slums, and the occasional bad direction, most abundant during fight scenes. I'm going to give Romeo + Juliet a C+, or a 7 out of 10.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Can He Not Wait?,7/10,anaconda-40658,30/12/2015,"Romeo + Juliet (1996): Dir: Baz Luhamann / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino: This is perhaps the most modern you can translate the works of Shakespeare and despite the intriguing vision there is much that may or may not translate. The story is as old as mold. Two families are at odds while the romance between a young couple is threatened. Interesting Shakespearean dialogue placed within modern society but we know the tragedy and the violence is more severe and repetitious. Juliet's home is wonderfully Shakespearean thanks to massive art direction that clashes both Shakespearean and modern society. Director Baz Luhamann gives the film a precise visual appeal that will bring a new image to the whole idea of anything associated with William Shakespeare. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes follow the formalities and pull off a modern day romantic Bonnie and Clyde persona until that forever cheap tragedy arrives. Brian Dennehy and Pete Postlethwaite are well cast as their fathers who see confrontation as an only answer. It presents modernization of the play but the violence seems tailored to action fans. Students of Shakespearean literature may disapprove of the modern translation due to its level of violence. It is not entirely successful but merely intriguing in its presentation of classic literature to the bizarre. Score: 7 / 10",pos
RomeoJuliet,overwhelming Baz Luhrmann style,6/10,SnoopyStyle,26/12/2014,"Baz Luhrmann injects his brash style into Shakespeare's famous play. It's the modern world in a place called Verona. The two families of Capulets and Montagues are powerful corporate giants with gun totting thugs. Claire Danes plays Juliet Capulet and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Romeo Montague. There is no doubt that this is one of the more unique interpretations. Luhrmann throws every visual flashiness at the audience. He's pumped up the material with so many bells and whistles that the story feels overwhelmed. The music choice sometimes grades on my nerves. The leads are an adorable pairing. I wish Luhrmann has some more faith in the actors to allow them some peace and quiet to do their work. They do good work in the balconey scene but Luhrmann can't stop moving. The flash and glitz becomes more of a distraction.

RomeoJuliet,Took a while to used to the original dialogue in this Tarentino-ish retelling,7/10,juneebuggy,24/9/2014,"I'm glad I finally watched this but I'll be honest I struggled to stay with this slick, fast paced update of the Shakespeare tragedy. I wasn't expecting the original dialogue and it took a bit to get used to.

Leo steals and captivates every scene that he's in though; so young, so cute and so talented, just amazing and it was through him that I eventually got into the movie. It's a very modern MTV-ish sort of retelling set in the violent, hip netherworld of Verona beach where the gun-toting Montague and the Capulet families battle for power and territory.

At times this felt like a Quentin Tarentino movie in its visual style, cool music and random bizarreness. Great performances all-round but especially from Harold Perrineau, Romeo's gender bending friend and John Leguizamo as his arch rival. The big battle between these three is when the movie really took off ""a plague on both your houses"" and the last half an hour is captivating as our star-crossed lovers meet their tragic destiny all because of stupid UPS. 9/20/14",pos
RomeoJuliet,Contemporized not Modernized,10/10,andrew_zito,31/3/2014,"Contemporized not Modernized

Some many reviews of this tasty film misuse the English in saying this production modernized Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet so patiently I resist beating down such verbalizations and those that present such limited misrepresentations. This film is deeper than a mere modernization it not only makes Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet understandable to a modern audience but liberates them from reactionary nostalgic beliefs for these are the contemporary wise guys dames thugs dudes and others so often marginalized by a society that demonizes humanity for all its wrongs characterized wrongly in what the government appoints itself the arbiter of in monopoly of what it sells and dictates but denies in others as it is all right just and proper.

A fine production fine acting fine writing fine set designs in an eternal romance as such will never die as a story that lives forever in that it is told so as to be brought to each generation a new in what is so well felt and inspires human beings where before there was none. In hopes of a better world that is prepared in the old world being seeded with new thoughts for new blood for new life in films by which we find life and meaning to our own miserable existence.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Seriously?,1/10,hijoicey,10/12/2013,"I guess if you're a high school drama teacher trying to get your 9th graders to take interest in Shakespeare, or help them understand Romeo + Juliet, I could see why someone might give this a high rating.

RomeoJuliet,"A movie that stands on its own, even in the shadow of a literary masterpiece.",8/10,phil1945,18/8/2013,"It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time.

The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word.

This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously.

The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired.

Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could.

It stands on its own.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Baz Luhrmann imagery doesn't connect with the story,5/10,KineticSeoul,14/8/2013,"""Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes"" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version.

RomeoJuliet,To perfection from tragedy,10/10,AvidClimber,4/7/2013,"Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance.

The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible.

The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent.

The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor.

The ugly. Nothing.

The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Modernization of an old Classic,9/10,rathantara,13/6/2013,"""Romeo + Juliet"" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled ""Dagger"" or ""Longsword"" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

RomeoJuliet,If only I could put negative stars on this...,1/10,MelonHead21,8/6/2013,"Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts:

This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid.

The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film.

ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something.

Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)",neg
RomeoJuliet,A modern day twist to the star crossed lovers,4/10,lisafordeay,25/5/2013,"I haven't seen this movie in a very long time but quite frankly I remember the WHOLE thing. The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again?

Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is.

Romeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him.

RomeoJuliet,Review of Romeo and Juliet,5/10,ravery-680-231690,8/5/2013,"The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

RomeoJuliet,A Fascinating Modernization of Romeo and Juliet,10/10,jjporter-678-219374,8/5/2013,"Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

RomeoJuliet,This is what happen if William Shakespeare lived in the 1990's.,7/10,ironhorse_iv,14/2/2013,"This is how his plays would look like. Romeo and Juliet is just one revision by director Baz Luhrmann and the MTV Generation, as the 400 year old written text by thee William Shakespeare is put though a grinder, and out comes the meat of the story repacked and sold to the audience. Romeo and Juliet is the story, oops I meant Romeo + Juliet is the story of two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. While most people know the plot, this movie just gives you all the highlights clips of the film in prologue. Yes, you don't believe have to bother watching the film, it's just shoot it up there with fast pace zooming and out, with epic background music. Unlike the 1968 Zeffirelli version, this takes place in the fictional modern-day location called Verona Beach, where the two houses of Capulets and Montagues are just giant corporations. What do they sell? Who knows-- all we know is that they hate each other for some odd reason and it's ripping the city apart. The play was set in Italy, but in this film, I have no clue if it's Latin America, America or some country in Spain. Believe me, I love Shakespeare, but it has its place, and doesn't need to be reduced to nausea-inducing jokes like having guns manufactured by Sword, wild car crashes, and over used drug use. That's just stupid and unnecessary. This is an antiquated love story, made for its time and best when set in its time. There is nothing good about making a loud, obnoxious, absurdly anachronistic monstrosity and sometimes this movie go overboard. Everything is modern, but the language of the film. If you don't understand the language, READ and study the story first. The language is early modern English, but has been translated into dozens of modern languages. By modernizing many aspects of the story and using popular, engaging actors to portray the roles, a new generation of fans can appreciate the gift of Shakespeare. Who would've thought to update Shakespeare to a modern setting, keep the original language, replace daggers with gun, and add a kick ass soundtrack? Quite frankly, it's genius and the execution brilliant, but it's a bit annoying. This movie does shows how Shakespeare can transcend time,﻿culture, and age, but not well suite. I've always interpreted the story as a tragedy, not a love story. Romeo and Juliet is hardly a love story. Romeo (Leonardo DiCapiro) and Juliet (Claires Danes) are two love-sick teenagers rushing headlong toward doom. Claire Danes was so well casted. She fits this role as Julia perfectly. So innocent, so pure, so divine. Leo is not just a pretty face. It's his pure talent, his amazingly unique looks, the way he speaks, and laughs, his piercing eyes, the way he adapts into characters, his innocent yet cheeky intriguing personality, and his intelligence. I do love the scene where both of their character meet through a fish tank. It was catchy, but still both of their characters are flawed. Romeo and Juliet may be a satire of a romance story. Romantic love in the basic sense is nothing more or less than physical lust rather than﻿the deep connection between two human beings. This seems to ring thought the characters as much of the theme of the piece is more loin love rather than love. Throughout, we are bombarded by sexual references, most of which are jocular. In the Queen Mab monologue, for example, Mercutio (Harold Perrineau) points his heavy laden and loaded, weapon at his own youthful tangled emotions. A powder keg of hot blood tormented and moved in night straightening. Youth is often lead by it's loins, and often into trouble. The stirring of mad blood leading to a fatal fate. This movie kinda ruins that monologue using Queen Mab as a drug. Harold does a great old as Mercutio, but it felt like Mercutio was just there to be a homosexual cross dresser drug dealer. That's pretty far from the source there, Baz. As the film goes on, a number of great theme comes into play, the bright colors, immaculate hearts, religious symbols like crosses, and stage on the beach makes the film seem surreal and strange. The violence is not so poetic when you take a bullet to the head. Have they actually read the book? We are so in glue as if it's a true love story when it's source really wasn't saying that. The whole play takes place over like four days!﻿How is that true love?!Love is usually the cause of nothing but anguish for the character's in his plays. Love not only consumes their lives, but often ends with them dying, killing someone, or going through a lot of ridiculousness before they can have what they love. It's not based on the subject he wrote in, but how Shakespeare wrote about love that proves the above statement. There's a sonnet he wrote that details his thoughts on love, and it's not flattering. In the play they're supposed to be quite young and don't take time to make good decisions. Both Romeo and Juliet are deluded in their love for each other, and their romance is a product of them wanting to escape their realities. Wouldn't the simplest explanation for their romance﻿ be forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest? I think this modernization of Romeo and Juliet makes it more reliable and entertaining. The supporting actors like Pete Postlethwaite (Father Laurence), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Miriam Margolyes (the Nurse) all play their parts great. Kissing you by Des'ree is a great emotional song, but still Romeo and Juliet are so freaking unstable in the modern sense. It's not a happy ever after, but a tragedy that this couldn't live up to the 1968 version.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Stylish and Confusing, But still Beautiful",8/10,thegreatshonen,15/1/2013,"Alright. This film is something. When I popped it in last week I knew what I was expecting and it surprised even me. This modern, bizarre, beautiful, crazy adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most beloved plays is something of a spectacle. It's a classic romance for MTV's generation X from one of the most electric directors of the last 20 years. And since I'm assuming up you passed a middle school literature/English class ill give slight spoilers.

There's a lot for me to talk about in this film. Lets start off with the art style and dialogue. To use Shakespearean English in a modern setting is at 1st kinda off putting. But I grew use to it as the film went on and became immersed in the story. The cinematography is brilliant and gritty like a gang film while having richness and fulfillment of something from renaissance Europe. The acting is pretty good across the board. Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes were pretty great. The said their lines well for young actors and besides a few scenes of over acting were good. ( Romeo pursuing Tybalt to kill him.) Their final scene is powerful and well done. The supporting cast was good to especially,Harold Perrinau (Mercutio), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Pete Postlethwaite (""Father Lawrence""). The music was good too and I love Talk Show Host by Radiohead( One of my favorite early songs by them).

However film has flaws. Because they use Shakespearean English they are awkward moments in the movie like Romeo's Banishment and the use of guns called swords. The film use of helicopter in the final scene pursuing Romeo proved a tad excessive too. Also the use of News Casters in the beginning and end is also weird.

Sometimes u can't take this seriously. And I didn't take this film to seriously. It's one of the most stylized and unique films I've seen. However it kinda fails in comparison to other Shakespearean adaptations, ( See Akira Kurosamwa's Ran) but its a fine film and worthy of being watched. If u hate the 90's or over the top movies, stay away. Everyone else, Enjoy.",pos
RomeoJuliet,One of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet,6/10,JamesHitchcock,13/12/2012,"In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" rather than simply ""Romeo and Juliet"". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. This might be true of something like the Kenneth Branagh ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", but it is certainly not true of this film. Derek Jarman's version of ""The Tempest"" probably remains the most eccentric Shakespearean film adaptation I have seen, but Baz Luhrmann's runs it close.

Luhrmann transfers the action to a modern American city, ""Verona Beach"", with the Montagues and Capulets represented as rival criminal gangs masquerading as legitimate businesses. The idea of portraying the two families as feuding gangsters is not an original one. It is copied straight from Leonard Bernstein's musical ""West Side Story"" and the film that was made from it. Like the Jets in the musical, Luhrmann's Montagues are white Anglo-Saxons, whereas his Capulets, like the Sharks, are Hispanic. (Mercutio, who belongs to neither side despite his friendship with Romeo, is black). ""White Anglo-Saxon"" does not, however, in this context equate to ""Protestant""; both families are obviously Catholic, and the film is notable for its use of Catholic religious imagery, with rosaries, religious statues, etc., much to the fore.

The difference between the two films is that ""West Side Story"" keeps the basic outline of Shakespeare's story, modernising it and transferring it to 1950s New York, but changes the names of the characters and does not use any of Shakespeare's words. Luhrmann, however, retains Shakespeare's original dialogue (in an abridged form), and only makes minor changes to the plot; for example, the Prince becomes Captain Prince, the local police chief, Friar Lawrence becomes Father Lawrence (a priest rather than a friar) and swords are replaced by guns. (This does not, however, necessitate any change in the dialogue; 'Sword' becomes the name of a gun manufacturer).

Luhrmann's film suffers from a problem common to a number of cinematic attempts to modernise Shakespeare. There is a jarring contrast between the modern setting and the sixteenth-century language, and an even more jarring contrast between that setting and the sixteenth century attitudes which that language expresses. These contrasts are not normally an issue in the theatre, which is a very different medium and which does not generally aim for the same degree of realism as the cinema. Filmed Shakespeare generally works better when the director either keeps the traditional setting (as Zeffirelli did with his ""Romeo and Juliet"") or transfers it to a fantasy setting (as Branagh did with his ""Much Ado about Nothing"" or Trevor Nunn with his ""Twelfth Night"", to take two other examples from the nineties).

To give an example of what I mean by a ""jarring contrast"", it seems odd to see on screen a late twentieth-century American police officer threatening, in antique language, two warring gang bosses with the death penalty if their followers cause any more trouble. Our instincts are to ask ""But what about their constitutional rights? What about due process?"" To reply that the police officer is supposed to represent a absolute Renaissance Italian ruler is no real answer; it merely invites the further question ""Then why not keep a setting in which rulers do have absolute powers of life and death?""

The film's other main drawback is that neither of the leads are very good. In 1996 Leonardo DiCaprio was still in the pretty-boy, heartthrob stage of his career; indeed, he must be one of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet, the pointy-chinned Claire Danes. Serious acting for DiCaprio was something that would not come until some years later, and here he is bland and uninteresting. Natalie Portman was originally cast as Juliet, but Luhrmann sacked her after production began, apparently because he was unhappy with the age difference between her (15 at the time) and DiCaprio (22). As, however, Danes is only two years older than Portman, and plays the role in a very ""adolescent"" way, with a breathy voice and a perpetual expression of wide-eyed innocence, I am not sure that the change in casting made any real difference.

I didn't like Harold Perrineau's camp, lisping Mercutio; he appeared to be trying to imply a gay sub-text into the relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, which struck me as inappropriate. Some of the actors playing the Capulets, notably Paul Sorvino as Old Capulet and Miriam Margolyes as the Nurse, affected odd foreign accents, while others, such as Danes, spoke in standard American accents. There were, however, acting performances I liked, such as John Leguizamo, who brought the necessary arrogance and swagger to Tybalt, Pete Postlethwaite's dignified Father Lawrence and Vondie Curtis-Hall's authoritative Prince.

Luhrmann's direction is a bit too flashy for my taste, with excessive use of cross-cutting, but he does bring a good deal of pace and excitement to many scenes, especially the fight scenes. Despite my reservations about the basic concept, and some of the acting performances, I have given the film an above-average mark, largely because it is Shakespeare, and you can't go too far wrong with Shakespeare, at least not with a play as great as ""Romeo and Juliet"". (You could probably go very wrong with something like ""Troilus and Cressida"" or ""Titus Andronicus"", but not too many people try to film those plays). ""Romeo + Juliet"" is always watchable, if only as an interesting experiment. It does not, however, compare to the really great Shakespearean films such as the Zeffirelli version of this story. 6/10",pos

Their pronunciation is lousy and they just don't have any sense of enunciation. Just watch Di Caprio's scenes with Pete Postlethwaite's Laurence: day & night. The movie is so well intentioned, the updating ideas are good, the production design excellent; even the frantic editing and the pop music fit this modern adaptation. But everything fails if your two main characters are played by modest actors who can't follow the archaic yet beautiful language of the great bard.A pity.

RomeoJuliet,A 6.8 score is unrepresentative.,10/10,markrequest,29/6/2012,"I'll admit to have been shocked when I saw this movie scored 6.8. It led me to read many of the reviews, good and bad, and the film seems to have polarised its audience, they either loved it or hated it. I'm most surprised by those who profess to be Shakespeare fans.

Shakespeare was not a period dramatist, he was thoroughly modern in his day. His plays tackled (amongst others) the military, comedy, drama and love and romance and he was well feted for his works in his lifetime.

If I were a fan, I should be delighted that his original (and now ancient) dialogue could be so well blended with the modern visual. Rather than spinning is his grave, I'd say Shakespeare would celebrate the fact that his play (screenplay here) still holds merit in a sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll twentieth century setting.

If you prefer, or can only accept, your Shakespeare with tights, green velvet costumes and feathers in the cap along with cut glass English accents and endless pauses to stare into empty space then don't watch this. If, however, you feel you can overcome the modern visual blended with its ancient dialogue, then this is a must because if you like it then I promise you'll love it and, if you love it, you will be well rewarded.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Romeo + Juliet = Entertainment,7/10,Marc_Israel_365,17/6/2012,"In this wildly artistic adaptation of the Bards classic, words stays true while more visually expressed, to underscore the incredible production. When the seasoned actors speak, you feel their words, but when the younger cast speak, it's the visuals that carry the feel of the plot. The music is clearly placating the MTV-ish audience and goes too far taking all too well known songs and giving them too important of placement. Torn over to include this review, I give the nod for Baz's vision and his guts in carrying it out. The infamous story is clearly laid out for a new generation and those caught in the middle of old school and Gen-X can appreciate the entertainment for what it is: a sassy, explosive, unstable and romantic tale of two star crossed lovers.

RomeoJuliet,Very disappointing...,1/10,Goldwaterproductions,11/6/2012,"I'm a huge fan of the original play and of Leonardo DiCaprio and the concept seemed fascinating: Set the play in modern times but have the original dialogue. Needless to say but the final result was awful. What was wrong with it? Well let me tell you.

First, the use of Shakespearean dialogue in a modern setting took me out of the movie. It was very gimmicky and it didn't flow right. Second, the acting is pretty bad. Even Leonardo DiCaprio gives a very bland performance. Third, the direction and editing is really frantic and crazy. The beginning you are just wondering what is going on? This is especially bad because you are supposed to take the story seriously but it's so hard to do so because the way how the film is put together is laughably bad. and finally, the pacing is awful! I don't know how many times I checked my watch during the movie to see if it was going to be over soon or not.

The only good thing I can say about this film is the art direction and costume design. It's all very well done but that's nowhere near enough to save this travesty of a film.

Please, even if you are a die hard fan of Leonardo DiCaprio like I am and feel the need to see every single one of his movies, avoid this film at all costs. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen! 2/10",neg
RomeoJuliet,Romeo Juliet the movie directed by Baz Luhrman,10/10,gcarey-334-466776,2/4/2012,"I had to come back to this movie and this director and give an airing to my opinion on this movie, somehow, from my recollection of it years ago and just seeing a snippet of it again on a TV rerun today.

The fist time I saw it, I could not contain myself it was and is a work of genius. A transformation of archaic English phraseology into such a contemporary setting that manifest its power and grace of the human voice across the centuries. The potent content and import of every sentence and action portrayed and powerfully, passionately conveyed and clearly understood even to the uninitiated to Shakespearean voice.

The modern settings and beyond clever, really inspired analogs to the Elizabethan moments and characters were absolutely brilliant.

I could not believe when I heard it was initially reviewed with criticism at its original debuts. Then I thought so was Disney's Fantasia ... clearly the work was ahead of the critics in both cases.

Let me just add a fact or two to buttress the credibility of my review here and my abilities to know a great talent when I see or hear it.

Fact 1.) I was a teenager (~17-18) sitting in my family's living room and a movie came on that I started watching ... after a few moments time I was engrossed ... I was sure I was seeing something I had never seen before it was the most exciting, engaging show TV or otherwise I had ever seen ... I began trying to grab siblings passing by pleading with them you have to see this movie, I am telling you I have never seen anything like it before ... though it fell on deaf ears I nonetheless noted that movie and it wasn't till years later in a talk show interview that I found out who the director of that movie was. None other then Steven Spielberg and his master work that he says himself he goes back to review when he wants to remember how to make a movie, titled ""Deul"".

Fact 2.) Years later a Texas Cowgirl band was playing at an IBM company outing that I was attending... they were I thought beyond good ... I had to have one of their CDs and went up to purchase one and with complete earnestness said, ""I really think you all will make it big."" The lead singer and bass fiddle player looked at me askance and sarcastically said, ""Oh you do, do ya!"". The other members graciously thanked me and signed the CD for me. They ended up being non-other than the Dixie Chicks ... and Oh by the way the lead singer was replaced before they went big time.

Just two examples but I have had many similar occurrences over the years. And Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet is another one of them.

RomeoJuliet,i give this movie a 9 out of ten. It was great,9/10,b-kenrick,27/1/2012,"This movie was great especially for the younger audience. it brings new life to one of the most well known Shakespeare plays ever written.The way the language was incorporated with modern life allows all groups to appreciate this movie such as: teenagers, Shakespearean,and movie lovers. Weather you watch it for fun or a learning experience entertaining for everyone.

In addition to being a great this version of romeo and Juliet explained the book in a new way. the words may be the same but the setting the actions and movements are different. they replaced swords with guns and the close they were are clothing we would probably wear. its a great book.

RomeoJuliet,An interesting interpretation.,7/10,guyincognito1,26/1/2012,"This is a good film. Be warned, however, that some of the dialogue has been cut. You will notice this from the very first scene (incidentally my personal favourite Shakespeare scene) but I do not think that this distracts from the plot or the quality of the great playwright himself. It has been modernised to best of anyone's ability, and it is to Lurhmann's that this still looks like a Shakespeare, and has most of the dialogue making sense in a modern setting.

This is actually one film in which Leonardo DiCaprio acts well, as helped by a great cast, including stellar performances by Harold Perrineau and John Leguizamo. All of the symbols used in he production were effective, if a little obvious, and all in all this film is slick and true to the original, down to even the minutest details. Even though little tributes to the original setting sometimes are a little 'in your face', they are nice, and further add to the sense of respect the film has for the play.

I am a great one for conventional, traditional performances of Romeo and Juliet, but I have to say that this is a very good film, and grips to the last, even though everyone knows what happens.",pos
RomeoJuliet,it was good but......,7/10,gabranth415,19/1/2012,"The movie is great but, they used guns instead of swords which make no sense to me at all. The guy from titanic is romeo. Juliet was the lady from Stardust. Juliet shot her self in the head when Romeo poisons him self. I really don't like that ending but what can you do you know. what I did like was they up dated it from the 1968 version, that one I thought was good. They put a lot more action in it. Also they better graphical effect then the other. It was was cool when they got married. I still rather have sword fighting . One more thing is, it may not have been the movie for me but it is a good movie for romance lovers. Over all it was good. P.S. Buy this movie or watch it if you are romance fan because you will love it.",pos
RomeoJuliet,quinton,2/10,quintonwynn175,19/1/2012,"i did not see all of the movie but, this is from what i saw... The movie follows the original script ""meaning the book"" very accurately. Like they, match each other.This movie does an excellent job of combining Shakespeare dialogue with modern imageryi.Don't really like the fact that The Capulets dress more like gangsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another they made it seem like that was the bad side. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns like he's a villain or the bad guy. i didn't really like the fact that they gave freyer they bad part and hes ah preaist. i liked the part when romeo was happy when juliet said yes she will marry him.

RomeoJuliet,I Love It,8/10,jimmy-stafford00,19/1/2012,"I really don't like Shakespeare at all, and I don't know much about ""how good"" actors are speaking in Old English, but I thought overall, Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were good at it. Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry on screen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fish tank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.

But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene. It felt like that was only going on for 1 minute. What I also didn't like was the relationship between Romeo and Mercutio. Mercutio... a drug dealer? The two were supposed to play best friends but they only seemed like casual acquaintances and ""drug buddies"" in this movie.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Shakspeare's Romeo and Juliet (1996 movie version),8/10,dshalaa,18/1/2012,"Hmmmm...So where do i start? The movie begins and instantly grabs my attention with the conflict between the Montague's and Capulet's. I immediately witness the dislike between the two families and know Romeo and Juliet really ARE star-crossed lovers. Into the movie when Romeo and Juliet first meet there both kinda have a lover's daze in there eyes;they fall in love at first site.(SO ROMANTIC!!!) Anyways later on the couple decides to get married but theirs a big problem, JULIET IS EXPECTED TO MARRY SOMEONE ELSE!!! Learning this Juliet decides that's not what she wants and devises a plan where she doesn't have to marry the man her parents have picked for her.Unaware of Juliet's plan Romeo does something that changes his life forever,Juliet shortly after does what Romeo has done and this is the most tragic part of the movie.(I wanted to cry :( If you want to know what happens in this love filled, thrilling, mind blowing,action filled movie i would seriously suggest taking a look at Romeo and Juliet with Romeo playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliet as Claire Danes.

RomeoJuliet,Amazing Movie!,8/10,lopez-angelica97,18/1/2012,"Watching this movie, was very entertaining. It was a bit different from the book in many parts but overall, the movie was very good. it seems as if the director and producer wanted to make the movie more modern, so they used guns, and everything was more like our day today. The language in Romeo and Juliet, is very unique, and even though we don't use that kind of English now, it seemed like everyone who spoke like that, sounded more professional and mature. for me, this movie was amazing (: for some people this movie might be boring, but that just because they aren't ""into"" the movie like they're supposed to be. the movie wasn't boring so i don't understand how you couldn't be ""into"" it. they picked the PREFECT man to play Romeo. Leonardo is an amazing actor! i took him SO seriously throughout the whole entire movie. hes an amazing actor, and hes also very handsome (:

RomeoJuliet,my review,7/10,tyshawnhodge,18/1/2012,"I think that the movie was good but it could of been better. I think that the idea of modernizing every thing excecp for the launguage was the worst part of the movie for me. If you was going to modernize it so that todays age people could understand it, you would think that the lauguage would be the most important part of the whole movie. What i did like about the movie was the addition of different races and the actors and actresses they had to play the characters. I think they did a marvelous job and deserved all and more awards than they actually got. Also the setting was perfect and the way they designed the set and the places that they had the action and the ball really put into perspective how rich and well of the capulets and the montagues really were.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Romeo and Juliet Review,7/10,sralston428,17/1/2012,I liked the movie because of the action that took place. I did not like the movie because i did not really understand the language the characters spoke in. Ithat thought could've used more current language because they updated the weapons to the current time. I liked the scene when Romeo and Juliet first met when they were walking around the party together trying not to get caught by Juilets fiancé. I liked this scene because i thought it was cute while they were kissing. They had love at first sight. Then they got married with out their families consent. Juliet faked her death so that she could leave her family to be with Romeo but he did not know about the plan. Romeo decided he did not want to live with out his wife so he drunk poison. Juliet awaken and saw Romeo drinking the poison but it was to last. Then Juliet killed herself. Both families were punished by the lost of a loved one.,pos
RomeoJuliet,Romeo&Juliet,8/10,pearlie-massey,17/1/2012,"In this film of Romeo & Juliet there were a lot of action, tragedy and romance. Since im a fan of these topics I enjoyed the film, however the language was very confusing. This is what made my ratings go down, other than that i enjoyed the film. The language consist of modern language which Im not familiar with. It also had a lot of dramatic irony, in which I really don't enjoy.However, i enjoyed the romance and action scenery which kept the movie interesting. Also in the movie when romeo and juliet had took their lives this very intense, this also made the movie very interesting,and sad too. That part of the scenery also made you appreciate your loves ones as well. Giving you a chance to feel what the two cross lovers felt.

RomeoJuliet,Modern Shakespeare Original,9/10,Desertman84,8/1/2012,"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name. It was directed by Baz Luhrmann and it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles.The film is an abridged modernization of Shakespeare's play. While it retains the original Shakespearean dialogue, the Montagues and the Capulets are represented as warring business empires and swords are replaced by guns.Some of the names were also changed. Lord and Lady Montague and Lord and Lady Capulet were given first names as opposed to the Shakespeare original where their first names are never mentioned, Friar Lawrence became Father Lawrence, and Prince Escalus was renamed Captain Prince.Additionally, a few plot details unimportant to the grand story arc were shifted; most notably, Juliet awakens just as Romeo poisons himself and the two see each other before he dies and she commits suicide.

The movie was able to keep the integrity of Shakespeare's text.Credit goes mostly thanks to the actors speaking the very same lines of iambic pentameter as written four centuries ago.Despite a flawed start, Romeo & Juliet proves the story deserves an adjective often attached to it: timeless.The only thing about it is when the filmmakers decide to jazz it up with crazy camera angles and rapid cutting for great visual and when it updates the story for modern times with screaming and shooting, it just gets lost somehow.But still,it remains good for viewing.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Odd one out,1/10,cctaylor-185-780844,9/12/2011,"I am convinced I'm one of the only people who hate this movie. People call it ""innovative"" and ""a work of art"", but i personally don't see how they can. This is a terribly overrated movie that certainly doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. The movie feels like a huge jumbled mess with horrible editing, and some pretty dreadful performances. It seemed more like a satire of Shakespeare then a modernization.

First comes the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is very bland at best. Even in the love scenes with Juliet, he had about as much personality as a piece of wood. Claire Danes was fine as Juliet. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. John Leguizamo was dreadful as Tybalt. He had a terrible case of overacting that made me cringe at his performance. Harold Perrineau's performance as Mercutio was (much like Leguizamo's) plagued with another case of overacting. The only actor who seemed to do very well in his role was Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Laurence. He had the calm, mellow attitude that was accurate for a modern version of the character. As for the supporting cast, none of them really stood out and even if they did it wasn't for anything good at all.

As for the production elements, it was very lack luster. The editing closely resembled that of Luhrmann's future film, Moulin Rouge. This means the editing was sloppy and quick, not allowing us to see some of the visuals created for the film. Everything else about the movie was just so forgettable: the music, the costumes, EVERYTHING.

So overall, this movie really didn't do it for me. I still can't believe so many people love it when i (as a Shakespeare fan) couldn't find anything to like about it. I can only imagine the poor Bard is rolling around in his grave at this very moment, knowing that his brilliant work has been adapted into this garbage.",neg
RomeoJuliet,One big mistake,3/10,WakenPayne,24/10/2011,"NEGATIVES Okay I am here to criticize the whole modernization of this. There is also the fact that they say the prologue 5 times in the opening. ONCE IS ENOUGH NO NEED TO RUB OUR NOSES IN THIS SHAKESPEARIEN TEXT!!!.

If they plan to modernize a film they could have done better than say ""draw your swords"" and then draw guns that say the word ""sword"" on it, Who calls this Clever? it's just stupid.

Then there's the acting: Leo as Romeo and Danes as Juliet can be debated but the people that play Balthazar, The Nurse, Juliet's Mother and Mercutio and a few other people were absolutely horrible.

To be honest I would have preferred the movie if they set it in 1500's Verona.

POSITIVES

The Shakespearian text was good, granted by some degree today's audience might find it difficult to understand but if you could see past all that then they might like this movie. Did you notice how I said I like the text that has already been written 4-500 years ago",neg
RomeoJuliet,It doesn't always work but it's a beautiful and interesting take on the play,7/10,Rickting,24/9/2011,"Romeo and Juliet set in a modern day urban environment with modern updates to all of the events but still with the original dialogue. OK then. Believe it or not, despite missteps, this adaptation mostly works and will finally interest teenagers in Shakespeare which certainly isn't a bad thing. It's better than Gnomeo and Juliet Thankfully! Baz Luhrmann makes the film visually stunning, and manages to fill it with gripping action scenes and touching romantic moments. A mixture of a music video, teen romance, gritty urban drama and Shakespeare, this will be a bit jarring to many (Myself included) but the ambition of the movie is to be admired. Claire Danes is OK but a bit annoying, while Leonardo DiCaprio owns the movie. The cinematography is stunning, and the film never stops being lovely to look at.

It's not perfect though. Elements of the play such as the scene where Lord Capulet is angry with Juliet and Romeo and Mecrutio's friendship are poorly handled, and the endless visual dazzle, beautiful as it is, can send the film into style over substance territory. The presentation of Romeo and Juliet and other things in the play is beautifully updated for modern audiences and while the repeated action scenes can leave drama in the sidelines, the tragic ending still has a lot of emotional punch. It's not the best Shakespeare movie of all time, but I can't dislike an urban drama which still channels Shakespeare so effectively.

RomeoJuliet,Stylish re-telling of the classic romance,8/10,angel-lloyd,29/7/2011,"Sexy, modernised, and tragically romantic, Baz Lurman's 'Romeo + Juliet' is a beautiful visionary, and a new way of looking at the romantic tale.

The cool and hip version of the romantic story is set in the beautiful city of Veraona. The art direction and cinematography alone is enough to captivate the audience. Brilliant film editing as well.

Performances from Harold Perrineau (Mercutio)and Leonardo Dicaprio (Romeo) definitely stole the film. Harold Perrineau, not only giving a brilliant dramatic performance, but also injecting some comedy into the film. Leonardo DiCaprio also gives an incredible performance as Romeo, showing him to be very loving and caring, but also a tortured character, searching for happiness. Although Claire Danes plays Juliet's innocence and youthfulness quite well, I think she makes Juliet unlikable, and I didn't feel like I could warm to her as much as Romeo.

The tragic ending comes as no surprise, as we've all known the story for so long. But Leo and Claire made it believable and very moving.

A modern, teenage themed phenomenon. Beautifully shot, with great performances. Highly Recommended.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Post-modern tripe.,3/10,the_naked_airplane,18/7/2011,"All set for the new century Baz Luhrmann updated one of the best loved stories of all time. Unfortunately it didn?t work. There is an uncomfortable clash between the modern setting and the original Shakespearean dialogue. The dialogue is delivered as though it were written by a contemporary writer-as is the point. However as a result the tone of the actors is wrong- for much of the film the cast sound as though they are about to break into laughter. 1990's teenagers reading 15th century literature in this tone simply doesn't work. It is in this that the adaptation loses its power, by diminishing the power of the original story Luhrmann's film has nothing but lots of fancy, overly stylised camera work?oh and Leo, which speaks volumes for the success of the film. Aimed at the teenage (female) audience much of it?s success was surely down to the young heart-throb?s presence.

I realise I've gone on about the dialogue quite a bit but considering this is an adaptation of a play i think it is fair criticism.",neg
RomeoJuliet,From Shakespeare to Punk Rock to MTV,2/10,blazesnakes9,22/5/2011,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the classic love story about two youths who fall in love. The setting is a city called Verona, where two households families fight each other off. One family is called the Capulets and the other is called Montagues. In this modern day adaption of the classic play, it turns out that wasn't fresh enough. The movie starts out pretty fast, with the camera making fast movements when we are introduce by new characters. What I thought would be a modern day version of Romeo and Juliet turned out to be a punk version, MTV hyped up story. The first few minutes of the films went by fast that I though I was seeing this movie in fast-forward mode. After seeing this movie in my freshman classroom, my English teacher said that this movie isn't accurate as the play. It isn't as accurate as the play. As for the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, those two are perfect, but sometimes I feel that they had too much love scenes that made Leonardo famous. Romeo and Juliet is not the perfect adaption to date. But, for those who are Leonardo DiCaprio fans, this movie is for you. ★★ 2 stars.

RomeoJuliet,"Where for art thou, entertainment?",3/10,StevePulaski,20/5/2011,"Romeo + Juliet is a failed attempt to modernize Shakespeare's classic play written all the way back in 1591. Its glossy production, awkward mix of old and new, and newer technology added to give it the ""present"" feel completely destroys the love aspect of the film and turns it into a goofy and lame adaptation of one of literature's many classics.

Obviously, this was meant for kids who don't like reading, but like action films. The scenes are loaded with primary colors and the action rarely ceases. The acting is beyond over-dramatic, and turns the characters into buffoons who barely represent their respected characters in the play.

The nail that seals the coffin is the film's mix of the old and the new style. It can't decide if it wants to fully change Shakespeare's work, or keep some in and some out. We get a messy result. The film hybrids over using pistols instead of swords and car chases to entertain ones who believe the play is ""boring."" To cover up the madness and chaos exploding on screen we get annoying and volume enhanced rock tunes that are out of place and just a complete and total waste of time. I would have never thought Radiohead would've made it in a film titled Romeo + Juliet.

The storyline is kept pretty much the same; Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed lovers who desperately want to be together. Romeo coming from the Montague household and Juliet from the Capulets, have known that their parents have had an ongoing rivalry forever but can't help but find solace in each other.

Despite its age and overall outdated language, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has managed to leach itself into the school curriculum year after year. The book is in no way a bad read. I found some parts hard to understand, but I was caught up within a few minutes. It does involve re-reading and your full attention.

The book is very outdated in terms of dialog. Obviously, no body says ""Where for art thou, mother"" in 2011. The most important aspect of a book is being able to read it and comprehend what it is telling you. Sometimes, that can be a task for current readers of the play. But with internet and technology at its peak I'm sure understanding it will be no problem.

I'm in no way bashing the book. I found it to be quite enjoyable and quite sad, but sometimes I kind of wish I knew what was happening instead of assuming. Still, the play is the grand-daddy of literature. I can except that, and I'm glad I read it.

With actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, and John Leguizamo I can only imagine how this film would've played out if it was made with some level of seriousness. It has been so long since we saw a new R&J adaptation, you'd think one would be remade again to fill the void.

What really kills this film, is the dialog. It keeps in place lots of Shakespeare speak. It is not only laughable, but questionable. First you want to completely modernize the film, then you want to keep the dialog. Maybe in someone's head it sounds pretty amusing, on film, it is atrocious and unable to take seriously. Especially when the film pans shots of some unnamed fat guy sitting on a lawnchair with no shirt on. Seriously? Romeo + Juliet is definitely a unique adaptation, but it is absolutely a horrendous turnout. Anyone in school watching this will likely be amused by its quirky take on the play and find it way more entertaining than the play itself because of its more blatant style. Shakespeare fans will be greatly letdown by the film's mockery of the play's tragedy. It is definitely a stain on Leo's filmography, and the rest of the cast's.

Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Rudd, Christina Pickles, and Jesse Bradford. Directed by: Baz Luhrmann.",neg
RomeoJuliet,A modern version of the greatest love story,9/10,Tweekums,4/3/2011,"There isn't much to say about the story of 'Romeo and Juliet' as it is probably the greatest and best love story written. In the city of Verona the Montague and Capulet families are mortal enemies. That is until one day Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet meet and fall in love; knowing that their families won't tolerate their relationship they marry in secret. While no one else knows of the union Romeo intervenes in an argument between his friends and Tybalt, one of the Capulets; he refuses to fight even when Tybalt attacks him. Coming to Romeo's defence his friend Mercutio is killed by Tybalt who in tern is slain by Romeo. For this crime Romeo is banished and Juliet's parents arrange for her to be married to another suitor not knowing she is already wed. To solve the problem the priest gives Juliet a drug that will make her appear dead and writes a letter to Romeo explaining the situation. Romeo does not get this letter and when he hears Juliet is dead he returns to Verona and takes poison himself. Juliet wakens as he is taking it but by then it is too late; he is dying, she then takes his gun and shoots herself.

Director Baz Luhrmann has brought a new twist to this old story; setting it in the present day. Surprisingly the Shakespearian language doesn't seem out of place, instead it comes across as the local dialect and references to 'swords' continue to work as we are shown that they are makes of guns. Leonardo diCaprio and Claire Danes are great in the lead roles; there is a real chemistry between their characters. Harold Perrineau is also notable as Mercutio; his opening scene is one that once seen you will never forget he is in drag wearing a silver costume, matching wig and bright red lipstick! Forcing school children to study the scripts often spoils Shakespeare; it was always intended to be watched as it is performed; in his day on the stage but now film brings another way to see it. This version might not be the most traditional but I think it could be one of the best ways of introducing somebody to his works.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Hilarious.... but not supposed to be a satire....,8/10,howlingchaoskitty,19/1/2011,"My rating is based on my enjoyment of the movie and not on it's intended execution. The acting would have been better for a true comedy, the modernization and Las Vegas-ization of certain scenes, not to mention the over-use of the original wording of the play make it thoroughly amusing, but not a drama masterpiece by any means.

When I first saw this movie I didn't expect to be in stitches by the end, but I could hardly breathe. This movie has become a favourite rainy-day movie for my friends and I.

I would recommend that you gather a few of your most sarcastic friends together for a night in and enjoy!

RomeoJuliet,Good as a Hollywood film.,7/10,tingletanglewonglewangle,2/10/2010,"As a great Hollywood fan, I enjoyed the film 100%. It's the Romeo and Juliet modernised. The structure of the film was good. The contrast between the two families was clear. The fire between the two families are well directed and exciting.In some parts, the editor creates suspense very carefully. The baseline of the story of Romeo & Juliet was told well.

As an actor and Shakespeare fan, I disliked the film. It was too different to the original. The love is the there, but not perfectly captured. The part I disliked most of all, is that even a lot of the lines are modernised. The poetry don't seem to be there anymore. The famous balcony scene was far from perfect.

If you are a movie fan and u know a bit about Romeo & Juliet, then I strongly recommend you watching this.

If you are, as I, an actor/ actress and really enjoy the proper Shakespeare's masterpieces and really want to see how the prose and iambic pentameter is read, then I recommend you to watch the Romeo & Juliet film of 1968 directed by Franco Zeffirelli.

I hoped this review has helped.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Beautiful,10/10,elenoid,13/9/2003,"Of all Leonardo DiCaprio movies this is the only one I liked. Baz Luhrmann did a great job,(as well as in the Moulin Rouge) by moving the whole story to our days. I saw Hamlet moved to these days too, by another director, but it was rather boring than great. This one, on the other hand was beautifully shot & performed. Specially by Claire Danes. She was real. She made e great expression to Juliet's emotions. The story is one of the most sweet, moving & tragic on earth. I loved it.

RomeoJuliet,Nicely Done,8/10,cestlavie03,22/7/2003,"Baz Luhrmann made a very wise choice in his cast choice, and in his direction! This Shakespearean play, made into current situations has been done to the best extent. By using original lines from the play itself, and current location and dress, this version of Romeo and Juliet should appeal to all audiences. It's not made out to be twisted or too thought provoking. It's merely a beautiful story well crafted into a beautiful movie. The use of a large city, and the way it is separated was a nice way to show the conflict, and a TV anchor as the narrator also added a nice 90's touch.

RomeoJuliet,If it's not broken. . .FIX IT!,10/10,vinnymac,19/6/2003,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is a classic tale. A story known the world over. A classic that many would have believed untouchable, unable to be enhanced, perfected. I believed the same, that is, until visionary director Baz Lurhman placed his hands on it.

This modern version of the classic tale is a wonderfully achieved and original vision. I was blown away by this masterpiece. With a stunning visual presence and a pacing that leaves you on the edge of your seat, until it's slowed down and you are drop back into a romantic moment like a pile of bricks.

It is one of the best, if not the best version of Romeo and Juliet to date. Absolutely brilliant.

RomeoJuliet,"the best of movies, the worst of movies",5/10,fearfuljesuit,31/3/2003,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes run a tight race for the Saddest Ever Attempt at Acting prize, but their competition can't ruin, and barely dims, the brilliant audacity of Baz Luhrmann's contemporary conception of this dramatic warhorse.

The genius update should be thrilling for any Shakespeare fan who's not a total snob. The flashy hipness should be a revelation for any teen who's been bored to tears in English class.

John Leguezamo and Chris Rock kick serious booty.

Baz Lurhmanns rendition of this play is contemporary and a work of brilliance. From the frantic action of the initial scene to the beautiful 'fishtank' sequence it never fails in its ability to entertain and had me completely enthralled for the hour and 40 minutes. Leonardo is breathtaking in his depiction of the tormented hero and with juliet (claire danes) suffuses the screen with real emotion. The film is a visual extranvaganza, a whirlwind of emotion and colour

RomeoJuliet,"Great, but different",10/10,sunshinegirl7955,15/2/2003,"Baz Lurhmann's rendition of Romeo and Juliet is one of my favorite movies, althoguh it is not completely true to the play itself. Many important elements of the original play are left out, such as Romeo killing Paris. Many lines are left out, but the movie overall catches the theme of the classic love story/tragedy. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing Romeo, and Claire Danes does a very good job as Juliet. The interpretation of the nurse is very different then what I first imagined it would be when I started reading the play, but it works. I love how the play was modernized to attract the youth of today. I know I loved it! Some people might not like this movie, ie: people who do not like change. But, if you are like me and you like modern culture and Shakespeare, then you will probably enjoy this.

I saw this movie at 15, and have seen it several times since. Though my perspectives on it have changed in some ways, the overall outcome remains the same: this is a masterpiece. For overall excellence in cinematography, directing, and adaptation, as well as near flawless acting, I rate this a 10, it couldn't be better.

RomeoJuliet,A fantastic-looking film which reinvents Shakespeare for a new generation,9/10,kaos-23,19/1/2003,"Even if you're dubious about modern-day settings for Shakespeare, you should see this film. Like Moulin Rouge (also directed by Baz Luhrmann), it looks great, with vivid colours and great cinematography. Most of the cast are excellent, and even though Leonardo di Caprio can be a bit irritating, his melodramatic acting style really works for the character of Romeo, who after all is a melodramatic and overemotional teenage boy! The California gangland setting works brilliantly and the soundtrack is inspired.

RomeoJuliet,Fascinating - I'm going to see it again!,9/10,morningkeith,6/1/2003,"I had never heard of the director, Baz Luhrmann, until I saw Moulin Rouge. But within two minutes of playing Romeo & Juliet on my VCR, I wanted to shout ""hey! I know this guy!"" It's all there: the juicy visuals, the frenetic energy, the throbbing music, the beautiful people, so loud and uninhibited. Damn! I wish I'd seen this at the theatre! But like Moulin Rouge, it probably threw people for a loop.

I say let it. This movie is a treat. I don't just want to, I NEED to see this movie again so I can catch what they're saying. Yeah, I could read the play, but I never did twenty years ago in high school, so why fool myself? Besides, Juliet's romantic musing about Romeo is soooo much sexier when Claire Danes is saying it.

(Makes me wonder: Leonardo di Caprio is in the just released Catch me if You Can, but what has Claire Danes been up to? Mod Squad doesn't count.)

Shakespeare is certainly a famous fellow, but it took this movie to open my eyes and mind. Thanks Baz. Keep living loud.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Two Houses in Fair Verona where our story takes place...,9/10,Funkypizza2001,30/12/2002,"ROMEO AND JULIET

STARRING: LEONARDO DICAPRIO, CLAIRE DANES

Two Teenagers. Lovers at first sight. Husband and wife soon after first kiss. Two deaths when a plague is put on both their houses. Demanding parents, constant fighting friends and a love that could never be is what makes Romeo and Juliet one of the most heartbreaking love stories and in Baz Luhrman's modern day version Leonardo DiCaprio, as Romeo, and Claire Danes, as Juliet, bring a new generation to understand the movie in better quality.

Romeo and Juliet is an epic story with an epic version added on. This movie consists of great humor, a wonderful balcony scene for Romeo and Juliet and a heartbreaking scene of death. This movie is beautiful and emotional in only a way Baz Luhrman can pull it off.

I give this movie **** out of ***** stars.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Emotional rollercoaster,10/10,stargaser,4/11/2002,"Shakespeare is one of the most prolific and talented playwrite's in all history. His work has been translated into countless languages, has been endlessly analyzed and discussed. There are so many adaptations of his work that it's impossible to name or even remember them all. So it must take an extraordinary cast, a visionary director and plenty of hard work to achieve a modern adaptation worthy of having Shakespere's name in the title. Buz Luhrmann and company more than meet the challenge of re-telling this classic story of star-crossed lovers into a modern rendition. I was priveledged enough to see this wonderful movie on the big screen in 1996, and now 6 years 1 VHS cassette, 2 DVD's (original and special edition), 1 book, 2 cassette and 1 CD soundtracks later I find myself just as moved by the movie today as I was 6 years ago. Buz Luhrmann and the cast take you on an incredible emotional ride. From the beginning you feel overwhelmed as you try to embrace the visual and audible power of the film, but as the movie progresses you discover that you become intune with the pace of the movie and the characters. Suddenly you hardly notice that the movie is actually utilizing old english language and that the play is actually 400 years old and you discover that you're relating to the characters and the story as though it was written for our generation. It is as though Romeo and Juliet were frozen in time until now and are re-living their lives in the modern times for us onscreen. I could go on and on about the movie and how it manages to captivate you for the entire 2 hours. I could discuss how the film takes you on the emotional rollercoaster from the hate driven rivalry in the opening, to the frolicing atmosphere of the Capulet bash, from the passionalte kisses in the pool, to the tragic and powerful ending that leaves you sobbing. I could, but I won't because that would take ages. Instead I'm going to say that this movie is definitely worth your time. The cast is spectacular and Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes just shine as Romeo and Juliet. Buz Luhrmann is a true visionary combining a rich character driven classic play with the lavish visionary feast for the eyes. All that combined with the incredible soundtrack from many talented artists and you have a bonafide winner. Watch it for yourself and you be the judge. My rating is 10 out of 10.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"the greatest version, of the greatest love story",10/10,untitledprohayes,28/10/2002,"if anyone say's that this is untrue to shakespeare then they obviously do not understand shakespeare. it is a joy to see that a film maker made this film, not just actors with a camera stuck on them for 2 hours. this is a fun, romantic, and true reenactment of the beloved play. Any one who says otherwise obviously has poor taste in films and is unknowing of the greatest writter who ever lived.

RomeoJuliet,"Great flair and brightness, but not a very good idea.",6/10,lord_KRISHNA,23/9/2002,"Yes, I must admit this movie is extraordinarily fast-paced, bright, and attractive. Cinematography and sound track all great a great visual experimente, as in Moulin Rouge.

However, the idea of the movie seems weird and a bit outlandish. One thing, you stay absolutely true to the Shakespearan original plot, cenarios, etc. (but obviously it wouldn't appeal to the public it set out to appeal) or you do a modern adaptation and bring the story to a modern context.

The idea of reading 16th century baroque dialogues while shootings go on and fast cars roam just seems extremely strange and intriguing. It just feels like an unfortunate mix Shakespeare's undisputed prestige and action movie's undeniable attraction that doesn't really work that well.

The two things are simply very different. It's like olive oil and water: they just don't mix no matter what you do or how hard you shake them.

Still, worth a good look.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Bloody Amazing,9/10,smorris200,2/9/2002,"I got dragged to see this film when it was first in the cinema by an old girlfriend. ""Oh No, i thought a load of schmolzy rubbish"". I was planning on having a good sleep!!

But, it blew me away. It is fantastic. The language is a little tricky to get use to, but as soon as you stop trying to understand every word and learn to listen to the flow of the film, it all makes perfect sense. There is humour, Drama, fine action and acting and great Direction. Baz Lurhman is truly a genius.

I got it on dvd last year, and got some odd looks from my current girlfriend. ""trust me,"" I said ""You'll love it."" and guess what? she did.

RomeoJuliet,An Ode to the Bard!,8/10,Nahret,12/4/2002,"There are some spoilers here for those who've never, ever heard about this play.

Often used as a blueprint for movies through the decades, never has Shakespeare's play about the true essence of love been brought to life in such spectacular, breathtaking fashion. Baz Luhrman does it again. In this case, he takes the Bard's play and transfers it to our times, our world. Yes, there has been a string of teen-movies based on classic literature recently (Clueless, Cruel Intentions, 10 Things I Hate About You, etc.), but where Luhrman goes further than everyone else is by actually taking Shakespeare's language along for the ride. And, surprisingly, it works. He knows how to pick the right lines of the play, to convey meaning understandable beyond its archaic words. And thus, when Mercutio (Romeo's best friend and the only drag queen I've ever seen in a Shakespeare) uses his dying breath to lay ""a plague on both your houses"", the immediate sense of foreboding makes itself powerfully known. More so, Luhrman even dares to play with these very words to add a unique sense of humour to high drama, as when a light in the Capulet's mansion goes on and Romeo says: ""What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."" But neither the occasional jest nor the almost comic-book like style of the movie's photography ever divert the attention away from the impending tragedy. The sheer force of the emotional build-up is astonishing - and serves as proof that Shakespeare's work transcends space and time.",pos
RomeoJuliet,A stunning look at a classic story,8/10,mickk-1,18/3/2002,"Film makers adapting Shakespeare for the screen usually run into two initial problems. Do they stay close to the original, more or less putting a play on film? Or do they update either dialogue or setting, or both? Baz Luhrmann has chosen the latter course, updating the setting while leaving the dialogue pretty much faithful to the original. The look of the picture is stunning. Modern day Verona seems both familiar and yet somehow strange. Ornate weapons and customized cars give it an otherworldly feel, while sweeping visuals and fast cut editing combine with a strong soundtrack that at times breaks into the action on screen, Mercutio's performance at the Capulet party is a prime example of this. The use of the original dialogue could have been more problematic, particularly when combined with a modern setting. Many people find it an effort to follow this type of language but they should make that effort, it can be very worthwhile. Just picking up the rhythm of the words can make you realize why Shakespeare's work has lasted so long. It is not just the stories, but also the way they are told. These two elements, sublime language plus a stunning visual design are well served by an excellent cast. Claire Danes is very good as Juliet, a little shrill at times, but she is playing a fourteen year old. As Romeo Leonardo DiCaprio is also good, but it is the strong performances of the cast as a whole that help make the picture what it is. Inventive, innovative and exciting",pos
RomeoJuliet,Is this a Glock I see before me?,8/10,rivercityrandom,28/2/2002,"It seems so odd and yet so natural that so many people would return to ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" and comment mightily in its favor only after seeing Baz Luhrmann's more recent masterpiece ""Moulin Rouge."" When I first saw this film as a teenager in 1996, having been raised on more ""refined"" versions of Shakespeare's plays, I remember being outraged at how Hollywood was raping the words of the immortal Bard, taking them out of context in order to make a buck. However, viewing this film under the lens of ""Moulin Rouge,"" it all makes sense to me now.

Baz Luhrmann, like Shakespeare, is a man of the theater, very bombastic, intense, and infused with showmanship. The reviewers who panned ""R + J"" for its lack of period costume seem to forget that Shakespeare himself wasn't exactly a stickler for historical accuracy. Shakespeare's plays bridged the gap between the historical periods they purported to represent and the Elizabethan mores of his day. You will notice that while the plays are set in places like ancient Rome and medieval Scotland, the actors in Shakespeare's day didn't wear kilts or togas--they are wearing Renaissance-era jerkins and tights. Luhrmann recognizes this, and sets his ""fair city of Verona"" in a world both modern, ancient and fantastical, where street gangs with ultramodern convertibles wield ornately decorated guns (named ""Sword"" and ""Rapier"" to fit with the 17th-century lyrics) against a backdrop of towering skycrapers and Gothic cathedrals, where TV newscasters compete with numerous images of Mexican-Catholic iconography, and where knights and angels fall in love in a spectacular Victorian mansion complete with tap-dancing butlers and a cross-dressing Mercutio diva. The story itself is told as intensely as the intense love between the star-crossed duo, through a bright mix of radical cinematography, using a mix of rapid cuts, pans, wipes, fades, blurs, and hallucinogenic imagery in a kaleidoscopic style reminiscent of music videos. The film is also punctuated through a self-conscious choice of color. Each scene has its own color scheme: scenes between the lovers are shot in a faded pastel color scheme reminiscent of colorized 19th century photographs, the gang battles are displayed in a violent mix of yellows and reds, the death scene... oh, sorry...

*** SPOILER ***

yes, Romeo and Juliet both die, as if you didn't know

*** END SPOILER ***

fades from glorious color to a cinema-noir black and white. This panoply of architecture, costume design, and film style serve to highlight the timelessness and timeliness of the Shakespearean drama, bringing it down from the pedestal of elite literature and lavishing it onto the ""penny-farthings,"" the ordinary folk, where it belongs. Baz Luhrmann brings theatrical art to a movie industry lost in its own sense of commercialism and self-importance, and to a genre (Shakespearean film) that often seems to be ""more matter with less art"".

In retrospect, it's obvious from the vivid display of the extremes of human emotion and the dramatic conflict between the Elizabethan dialogue and the modern setting that this movie knows that it is a movie, a self-conscious entertainment pop-culture product, rather than displaying the events with a false sense of truthfulness and subliminal emotional manipulation. This one fact makes ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" a lot more honest than most ""realistic"" movies today.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Baz Luhrman: the only man in hollywood who understands Shakespeare?,10/10,RobMontu,23/1/2002,"I was always a fan of Shakespeare. And since 'Moulin Rouge', of Mr. Baz Luhrman. I have seen 'Strictly Ballroom' quite a few times and 'Moulin Rouge' more than any other film ever, most likely.

And so, why not see Romeo + Juliet, the one film in which the two combine? Well, maybe because there has never been a good adaptation of the play to film- never.

The 1936 one, a bore, the 1968 one, terrible, the others, well, the others most of the people I know of agree- sucks.

Except for 'Westside Story', which is, after all, not the play, just the story, and even then, one of the lesser musicals.

William Shakespeare is NOT the spectacle Hollywood would want you to believe, in fact, it isn't even the spectacle this film would leave you to believe, but nonetheless it's my honest opinion that this film IS one William Shakespeare- not in the historical context but in the context of the spirit. As Baz continually said during the commentary, track to 'Moulin Rouge', he wasn't interested in creating the real-world Moulin Rouge of 1900, or in this case the real play, on it's opening night, but rather the feel of it, for today's, modern, audience, particularly the young, hip, teens and 20-somethings, who need such aid better than anyone else.

And lets picture what that opening night would've been like. Entering `The Globe Theatre', us- the slimy peasants, with natty hair, dirty skin, smelly armpits, and hair- everywhere, even the ladies. Paying cheap prices for the cheap seats, right down in front. Not only right down in front, but on the dirt, with rats, worms, and other such creatures of the night. Ready to watch a play by one Shakespeare, we'd seen plays of his before, and enjoyed them, and excitement is building. The curtain comes up- the play begins, little scenery, costumes and props, just the words, and the actors to say them. We, such unintelligent low-life's, listen to them closely, understanding every word of poetry, hanging on to every syllable, the words filling our souls, the excitements building, and we're whisked away on and unending dream of hope, love, violence, and hate, as we have never done before, or ever will. The doomed were not kings, not emperors, not generals, or pharos, not even truly aristocrats yet, just young lovers, hopeless dreamers, slight eccentrics, as we all once were, and hoped to be again. And for the hour or two of the play's duration we were, and when they died, when it ended we wept not just for them, but also for ourselves.

This is what a truly good movie does to us, happy or sad, this is what there meant to do. Like 'Citizen Cane', 'Intolerance', 'Greed', or for a lighter fix, 'Singing in the Rain', 'A Hard Days Night', 'Moulin Rouge', and most certainly 'Romeo + Juliet'.

We go in, our jobs bugging us, the stress killing us, fear overriding us, to find sticky floors, chewing gum, and crusty popcorn. The lights gently come down, the sound, abruptly comes up, in one of those annoying THX sound blast things, and suddenly, the world changes, specks of light, sound, blacks and whites, all the colors of the rainbow, flash onto the screen in an unendingly magical mesh of sights, sounds, emotions. The story doesn't matter- if it did then this film wouldn't be here, the play would've been forgotten long from now- it's pulp drivel, violence and contrived love for the entertainment of peasants, back long before you were born. But the sights overwhelm you; the sounds fill your ear, the listen to every note, grasp every frame, and are whisked up on a journey of hope, love, violence, and hate. Thanks to the film and to the words, you become a teen-ager once again feeling love for the first time, and when they die, you weep, not just for them, but also for yourself.

Baz Luhrman is the only man, woman even, in Hollywood, or the world over, who truly understands William Shakespeare and his work, or at least attempted to bring it to the screen with such a true understanding, with the possible and quite notable exceptions of the cast and crew involved in the making, producing, and writing of this film, (a statement which has a two exceptions of it's own, dear Claire and Leo, who play the leads.)

They created a film, which brings to us, today, what the play was to them, yesterday, and those before them, and those before them, all the way to that very first performance.

The cinematography, lighting, editing, sets, and what not are some of the best if not the best I have ever seen.

The music is absolutely brilliant, even including a few minor musical numbers using modern pop songs, as Baz and his team did later in Moulin Rouge.

And then I guess we're forced to move onto the acting which is quite good, but quite a few of the lines are muddled, yelled, are meshed all together- but that is of no importance, for what word was to the peasants, the visuals, score, and sound effects are to us thus placing the word- useless.

Now of course that view might place some out of favor of this review but trust me, the film would be equally poetic with or without the work of the great Shakespeare. But the attitude would not.

This film is brilliant in all manners and if you dislike it your probably one of those `Shakespeare Purists' who think that Romeo & Juliet should be paraded in the fashion it was meant for with sets, costumes and stars the Globe would have never afforded, and using true Italian actors, on an English play, but quite frankly, not to be rude, you are quite wrong in your theory, how should Shakespeare play, like any great thing, however it's interpreters wish, but for my money, the only one worth viewing, is this, or maybe Julie Taymor's Titus- especially if you liked this, and even more so if you didn't.

A film of wonder, majesty, grace, beauty, elegance, excitement, romance, love, comedy and violence, Romeo + Juliet is truly perfect, in an (admittedly) flawed way, but aren't all greats?

AND ALSO OF NOTE- SOMEWHAT OF A ***SPOILER***: Many people have stated this films gang-war aspects were stolen from 'West-Side Story', but, if you really pay attention, the two houses in Romeo + Juliet are business rivals, their children, and friends of them, merely juvenile delinquents with some need to hate somebody and so the choose each other, due solely, to there families hate, just as in the original, relatively.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Surprisingly good.,8/10,Funky A,30/12/2001,"The fact that I loved Moulin Rouge convinced me to see Romeo + Juliet, Baz Luhrmann's previous movie but I was a bit worried. First of all, Romeo and Juliet has never been my favorite Shakespeare tragedy. And the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio had the role of Romeo did not convince me either. He is not a terrible actor, but he is certainly not a great one. Well, luckily Luhrmann's name convinced me to see this very good version of the classic play. His directing is impressive. The actors also do a great job. Danes and Dicaprio are a great couple, and John Leguizamo is perfect as Tybalt. His performance convinced me, along with his role in the incredible Summer of Sam, that Leguizamo is an excellent actor, someone with the potential to be remembered as one of the great actors of his generation. The rest of the cast is also very good. Sure, there might be a bit too much screaming from time to time but the energy with which Luhrmann films everything makes it seem normal. As for the story, it is told with enough passion to make me forget about everything I dont like about it. All in all, this movie is worth your time, although if you are in the mood for Shakespeare at his best, watch Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version of Hamlet. But if you dont have time for this wonderful 4 hour epic, Romeo + Juliet is a dynamic version of a classic story.

Baz Luhrman is a great director, and doing a film like this one isn't easy. Many people make films on Shakespeare plays every year (probably because they're not copyrighted!) and many of them genuinely suck, especially the ones that try and put it in a modern setting (if there are any others). But this one achieves those things with flying colors!

RomeoJuliet,Colourful neo-modern adaptation,8/10,exousir,3/11/2001,"Much better than the standard retrofit of classic stories. Instead of following the Hollywood norm and creating a new story around Romeo and Juliet, Baz has taken the original and restaged it. The result is an edgy and sometimes powerful movie.

Whilst some references (such as weapons) were skilfully modernised, it was sometimes over the top and verged on cheesy. For example, the longsword was somewhat blatant.

My main criticism is that the movie still managed to feel slightly Hollywood sanitised. Gore and violence was deliberately toned down to nearly the level of James Bond movies. The inclusion of the graphic display of violence would have made the tragedy much more powerful.

RomeoJuliet,"Come on, this is good stuff.",9/10,davidraymonkey,26/10/2001,"Baz here achieves what most filmmakers haven't got a clue about. He has certain moments - not all of them - but some where he's able to rise above the medium and touch that sublime everywhere we all dream about it. Funny how he got closer here than his Kidman Rouge spectacle, which, at least consciously, he really worked...

RomeoJuliet,Worst Version In The History Of Ever,1/10,Shampoochie,15/3/2009,"I recently bought this version at Walmart for 5 dollars, which should have been my first impression on how terrible it was. I could hardly believe how terrible it was, the cover itself said it all. (Keep in mind I bought the Music Edition) On the cover it showed Romeo in a vacation shirt, much like the Hawaiian style that business men wear on casual Fridays, it showed Juliet in a dress with wings. Shakespeare never intended for it to be this bad. There were no daggers or knives at all, zero, absolutely nothing. Yet there were guns.

I understand that this was supposed to be a modern version. However! Manuta is a city, not a trailer park, and the priest didn't send off the letter to Romeo, his squire did. Yet, a FedEx style man is shown knocking on Romeos trailer door, not getting any answer and leaving a note in Romeos mailbox. It then shows that the pries goes to FedEx (or whatever its called) and resending it.

The only reference it makes to the original story line is the poisons, and even that is total bullshit. True Juliet drinks a poison to appear dead and also true Romeo drinks a poison to die, BUT, Juliet wakes up and touches Romeos face and THEN he downs the poison. Also she is in a cathedral on a bed type thing when she is supposed to be laid to rest in a tomb (I don't think thats the right word) with all her dead family members. It is absolutely ridiculous, and anybody who has seen it and actually likes it, is a dumb ass.",neg
RomeoJuliet,"Dazzling, reverent and audacious at once, and a beautiful telling of a beautiful story",9/10,secondtake,5/5/2013,"Romeo + Juliet (1996)

Spellbinding. Pushes hard at the limits of a contemporary kind of Shakespeare while still keeping all the intense rivalry and romance. It's sometimes awkward, improbable, and even ridiculous if you don't jump in and just go with it. But if this is at all up your alley in spirit or in a love of the original play forever finding new turf, you might just be blown away.

I was. I saw it the first time late at night traveling and a bit bored and restless and from the first scene to the last I forgot the world and was twisted and pushed and amazed. You might be able to say any one actor--like Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo or Claire Danes as Juliet--is breathtaking, though many certainly are superb. What you find is the movie itself is the star, rapidly conjoining unlikely scenes and making individual contributions flare and sizzle in jarring succession. The filming, too--under veteran Donald McAlpine--is gorgeous and original without being distracting.

Shakespeare deserves some credit here, taking a classic problem and turning it into an archetypal drama. The problem is just when two people fall in love from different sides of the tracks. The drama, of course, is the eventual suicides out of pure love. If you don't know the story and I've ruined the ending, I'm sorry. (I won't say who kills themselves.)

See this? Yes. Yes. Yes. But be warned--it starts with such a bizarre boundary pushing adaptation of the classic confrontations in modern gang terms you might just say, woah, this is stupid and horrible. You really might. But if you can hang in there until you get the two title characters going, and get them to meet, you'll at least know how deliberate and creative the whole movie's style is.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Wow, no.",1/10,katlinworthington,18/1/2010,"Yeah, well... if you want to enjoy this movie buy some crack or some E, OH wait Romeo already bought it all. Why in the world is Romeo on ecstacy in this movie? Of corse he fell in love with Juliet, he was horny as ol' men in a college. I'm a teenager and not in one way did this help me relate to Romeo & Juliet. It was stupid and half the people that died in the play didn't die in the movie. The enemies didn't end up getting along.. was that not one of the huge lessons to be learned in the play? I don't know what the director was aiming for .. but the second he decided to put them in flowered shirts his movie got REALLY bad.",neg
RomeoJuliet,The most stupid ending in the world,8/10,small_aubergene,22/3/2005,"I'm not going to tell you much about the whole movie because it's quite wonderful, funny, emotional, colourful, clever, etc., etc. It's just the ending that really annoys me. We all know about the *plot spoiler* ending with Romeo finding Juliet seemingly dead, killing himself before she wakes up and then kills herself, but did Baz Luhrman have to do it in such a silly way? The first example, is the set, which looks very dangerous. In fact it looks stupidly dangerous with all those candles around. No church would have that many candles lit and left unattended. If they had wanted to cremate her, why did they not have it done properly?! Next comes Romeo perched on the side of the bed. It's obvious that she's waking up. Her fingers move on his hand. She opens her eyes and she's grinning at him with a smile that is so white it could blind. Yet he drinks the poison and she tries to suck it off of his lips. She might have well stuck her tongue down his throat for all the good that it did. Then she eventually spots his gun and as calm as anything puts it to her head and fires. They end up just lying there dead together, with just a few splatters of blood. There would have been much more blood (and brain) than that. It just really annoyed me that what could have been a very emotional scene was so long drawn out and done in a way that shows that perhaps the star cross'd lovers only have a brain cells between them. I'm annoyed with that. (And Mercutio dying because he was just lovely).",pos
RomeoJuliet,Is this some kind of joke?,3/10,mkcross,8/6/2014,"I love the story of Romeo and Juliet, but this is garbage. I mean I know that having it in modern day might be easier to go along with, but its just stupid and it doesn't seem like Romeo and Juliet instead it seems like a parody of Romeo and Juliet there's so many weird things that don't belong in the movie that would be a Shakespearean classic if it was done right. The biggest problem comes back to the fact that it's modern day, because it isn't relatable to how Romeo and Juliet's lives were like, instead its more like a insulting joke that isn't funny by the way from the bad costumes to Juliet dressed like an angel and Romeo in cheap shining armor to the pathetic performances from otherwise very talented actors even Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was embarrassing to watch. My advice? watch the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet it's a lot better and is a real Shakespearean classic.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Exceeding Expectations,10/10,lemoncakess1209,7/5/2013,"Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script.

Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide.

Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy.

All in all, I give two thumbs up.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Did the movie fail to meet Shakespeare's intentions?,7/10,kiyombomununga,7/5/2013,"Romeo and Juliet the modern version was quite interesting. Shakespeare wouldn't like Baz Luhrmann version because the setting doesn't fit with his Elizabethan style of writing. He would like it better if the dialogue was more modern to fit the setting. In Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare likes to use a more secretive way of showing love of passion instead of just being intimate unlike Luhrmann's version. In the being of the movie of Luhrmann's version I didn't like it because it was too odd for me and I wish that they would just use modern language to complement each other. Later on in the movie I sort of put that thought to the side because the actions Luhrmann was taking in the movie were very unusual and interesting. Some of the actions in the movie seemed to grab my attention more than the play would. I liked seeing the actors' emotions into each scene and it was very intriguing.

RomeoJuliet,Visually bold and very 1990s take on R&J,8/10,MissSimonetta,13/3/2013,"I'll admit it: the first time I saw this film in high school I despised it. I found it so ridiculous, so over-the-top that I could barely believe that anyone could take it seriously. I wondered how anyone could think this film was even close to touching the greatness of the 1968 Romeo and Juliet, which is one of the most beautiful films ever made. I'm in college now, and for my Shakespeare on Film class, I had to watch this again. And this time I found myself enjoying it! Not that I still don't have issues with it, but it's much more striking and moving than I remember.

The film's style is very over-the-top. Scenes such as the Capulet and Montague boys at the gas station or Lady Capulet conversing with Juliet about checking out Paris at the ball are played to almost cartoonish extremes. Every image on screen pops with color. The first time I saw the film I found it all garish and much too 1990s, but now I find there's a strange beauty to it. It's as far from the lush Italian setting of the 1968 film as you could get, but it's cool in its own way and there's a ton of motifs, such as the constant use of religious images which contrast with the violent acts committed by the characters. The music is pretty good too, especially ""Kissing You"".

The acting is mostly competent. Claire Danes makes a radiant Juliet, girlish and passionate. Other highlights are Harold Perrineau as Mercutio (the scene where he's performing in drag kills me every time) and Pete Postelthwaite as Friar Laurence. The only actor I had any problem with was our Romeo. Leonardo DiCaprio is handsome and passionate, but the way he delivers a lot of his lines bothers me. His delivery doesn't do the words justice at all.

I still think the 1968 version is the superior film, but I'm glad I saw this again. It's a beautiful film, if only a little-- okay, very over-the-top. But still, it's worth checking out.",pos
RomeoJuliet,weird a$$ movie,1/10,ryanfairbairn7,23/5/2012,"I was completely lost, this movie was stunningly overdone. It was just plain bad and nasty to watch, It felt like an acid trip. It was as off it was a very strange foreign movie that was in English. It also seemed to me to be a parody of Los Angles, mobsters, and foreign movies. This isn't even done in a funny way but a gross and depressing horribly written version of the story of romeo and Juliet. Once you get over the extremely weird setting and general atmosphere/ cloths- the actors were actually really good in a sort of over acted way. The story line is well done but that's probably because it was Shakespeare work and not theirs. Whoever wrote this (not the dialog but everything else) needs to be fired and banned from ever working on or watching any movies ever again.

RomeoJuliet,Benvolio's neck is bigger than his head.,1/10,jake-shavinski,5/5/2010,"This movie just p*ssed me off. I can understand trying to make a modernized version of Romeo and Juliet but why on earth would you keep the dialog the same? Some people may say this is artistic and staying true to the original play but in my opinion it just seems to clash with the modern setting. That brings me to another point, plot holes. Yes it's one of the most amazing plays of all time, supposedly, but that doesn't mean there aren't plot holes. While it's hard to find them in the original play, they're easy to locate in this version. For example, Friar Lawrence sends a UPS Priority Mail Package to Romeo out in the desert. Not only could he have tried to call Romeo, seeing as how nearly everyone in America had phones, but he sends the Package containing the letter possibly hours after Juliet has taken the potion. Even with Priority Mail, the package would have taken a while to get there.

Then there are the characters. Listening to the actors I noticed something. Every single line seemed forced. It didn't flow fluently and half the time they just rush their lines as though they're just trying to get it over with. Why? Because Baz Luhrman decided that it would be a fantastic and wacky idea to keep the original dialog intact. I swear, I hope this guy dies like Steve Irwin.

The audio for this movie was phenomenal, especially the chase scene at the end. That's the only good thing i can think to say about this film. The amount of time put into some scenes is just agonizing. We get to see Juliet dancing with Paris but we never hear any dialog from Romeo. This scene seems to last forever if only because nothing happens. If they just edited it out nothing in the movie would have changed.

If you ever need to see an awesome film from the 90s that has some ""Wacky"" ideas, a good sound track, great acting and characters you'll never forget, go pick up Pulp Fiction instead. This movie is definitely not worthy of your viewing pleasure.",neg
RomeoJuliet,"it's not a terrible movie, it's just..... huh?",5/10,Quinoa1984,14/1/2009,"I remember seeing Romeo + Juliet in a high school English class... or at least I'd like to pretend I did. If anything, I probably remember reading the actual play more, or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version. Bored one day (very bored, though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person), I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it. It's not as bad I've heard from some, which is that it's one of the worst films ever made. It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments. Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack, that much is completely certain, he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored. This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge, for better or worse, the significant achievement it was. But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all: casting.

And I don't mean that in the sense of ""oh, casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and, uh, John Leguizamo I guess"", that notion is a given. Watching the film today, after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general, the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances. Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves. And as for the two stars, Di Caprio and Danes, they are pretty to look at, but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material. Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that ""oh, I'll cast them for this look and that"", but of simple things like rehearsal. I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world, the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles, all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover.

So in short, there is a vision here, but its squandered when the human elements are left beside. Some bits are worthwhile, like Pete Posthlethwaie (sic) s the priest, but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances. It's shiny and goes fast and crazy, but there's not a lot of substance much... at all. That being said, it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music, as cheesy as it can get.",neg
RomeoJuliet,GR8 Movie!,9/10,stone_cold_mahi,1/2/2006,"I love the way Baz Luhrmann directed this movie. The interesting style that Baz has produced in this film made the film very amusing, especially with the guns instead of swords and daggers. The way this film was made showed a very interesting style that really caught my attention. Although Shakespeare's language is still used in this modernised play, the way the film is directed helps people understand it through the acting and not only the words from the script. Each and every character was a good choice especially John Leguizamo. John is so great at being evil in this movie as Tybalt. I love him!! The way he takes off his jacket, points the gun and smokes his cigar in the beginning of the film is one of the best scenes in the movie.

RomeoJuliet,A great modernization,10/10,marco-falcon,29/11/2005,"Romeo and Juliet was a great play written by William Shakespeare. Many of you could think that modernize a classic is that kind of thing which makes you say: ""oh, no!"". But this isn't the case. The tragedy is perfectly modernized, with a great street spirit which represents perfectly the duel spirit of Shakespeare's time: everyone has a gun, just like a sword in the ancient times; clothing is exaggerate, exactly like in Shakespeare time; and many other things. For the screenplay we can see great images like at the beginning, the duel between Montague and Capulet's men is thrilling also thanks to the screenplay; then we see Romeo in front of the sunset: a very beautiful effect. The soundtrack is full of big names like Cardigans, Radiohead: in particular I appreciated Radiohead's one, perfect for its usage. There are also more ""epic"" songs, in old style, used perfectly in their original form and also remixed to create more suspense. There is no doubt, Romeo+Juliet is an excellent movie, a great modernization, a masterpiece.

RomeoJuliet,This movie changed my life!,10/10,kmaloney7659,13/11/2005,"I didn't really want to see this movie but my daughter brought it to my house and practically ORDERED me to see it. I agreed and next thing I know, my faith in Leonardo DiCaprio's acting career is restored. This young man did such an amazing job in this film, I'm surprised he didn't get nominated for an Oscar for that role.

I've always been a big fan of Shakespeare, especially Romeo and Juliet, and I've never seen such an awesome rendition of the timeless tale of true love and tragedy. Mercutio was portrayed with amazing truthfulness to his real character, as were Paris and Tybalt. I was even impressed with the Nurse's part in the film and I was never a fan of her in the play!! I must say, my favorite character of all was Father Laurence. He's so cliché in the play, the typical priest, however in this film he had true character! Of course, it doesn't hurt that he was played by my ALL TIME FAVORITE actor, Pete Postlethwaite. This part was very reminiscent of his role in Dragonheart.

More or less, Romeo and Juliet is the best movie ever and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. :)",pos
RomeoJuliet,Baz Luhrmann is incredible,9/10,thesuperclam,14/9/2005,"I greatly enjoyed the way Baz Luhrmann brought Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet into a more modern setting. I loved Moulin Rouge, and you can distinctly see Luhrmann's same style coming through in Romeo + Juliet in the filming, the sound effects, and the settings.

The classic tale of the two star-cross'd lovers is set in a present-day Verona, with the Montague/Capulet war spanning the entire city. While the setting is modern, the dialogue is straight from the play, which I think was done wonderfully. But even if Shakespeare seems like a different language to you, you can still understand and enjoy the movie.

RomeoJuliet,It's just that the time was... right!,9/10,paul2001sw-1,18/8/2004,"For all the Shakespeare's greatness, filming the bard's works presents problems, owing to the static staging, the need for the cast to act unsubtly to convey the meaning of outdated language, and subject matter not obviously attuned to modern life. The last problem is in fact a mirage, as beneath the surface concerns of his works, Shakespeare addresses universal themes, which is why many have tried to update his plays for modern times: but a straightforward modernisation misses the point that it is the language they contain, rather than their generic and contrived plotting, that makes them great in the first place. Director Baz Luhrmann therefore tried a different strategy: change the style but keep the words. So his 'Romeo + Juliet' is set in an apocalyptic hybrid of Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, and filmed as a cross between 'Dynasty' and a pop video, but retains all the original poetry. The lurid result is surprisingly fresh, and huge amounts of imaginative fun are had in translation (my favourite details: the depiction of the clans' fathers, one as Ted Kennedy and one as a mafioso; the use of the swimming pool in the famous balcony scenes; and Romeo's exile as a hippy in the desert). Some of this interpretation is over the top, but there's more hit than miss and even Mercutio (played by Harold Pirreneau as a drag queen) brings real passion to his death. As for the stars, Leonardo di Caprio, an actor of limited range, is well suited to this role, while Claire Danes smiles fluourescently and speaks the centuries-old dialgoue with the saucy naturalness of the contemporary American teenager. The tricksiness fades towards the end as Luhrmann concentrates on the intrinsic drama; but never do you feel like you are watching a play. In conclusion: Shakespeare still rocks, and Luhrmann does too.",pos

I found the chance in the time and place that the story takes place rather boring and it did nothing for the movie as an experience. I got the feeling that it was just an attempt to draw interest from the media and public, rather than to bring something new to the story. Acting is rather nice, but it was hard to see diCaprio as Romeo - again, a rising, if not famous, boy-actor was used just to draw attention to the flick. I'd recommend some older version of the story, if not the original written story, for those who find the story interesting... 4/10

RomeoJuliet,"Intriguing and clever, but maybe too clever",7/10,stills-6,4/6/2000,"I like cross-period staging for Shakespeare - like Ian McKellen's Richard III or Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It always gives a good perspective on the strength of the underlying story. It can also be said that it gives the director something to do - like a post-WWI staging of Much Ado About Nothing - other than trot out the same costumes as from the last production.

I thought this version was very clever, but maybe more clever than it needed to be. The swimming pool scene (in place of the balcony scene), for example, was an inspired choice. The interaction was much more immediate: standing at a balcony is a scene designed for a stage, not for a movie. But the sense of the scene is also lost. By this time in the movie, the two have already fallen in the deepest love they will ever have (whatever that means - lust is more like it), and the action falls from there. But the play implies much more of a process, instead of proof. The balcony scene is that of two lovers parted by circumstance, both literally and figuratively. The meaning is changed, though subtly, and not necessarily for the better.

I didn't like many of the start-stop and fast-forward camera tricks, not because they are a bad idea in themselves, but because the style negates the scenes they were intended to augment. I especially did not like the faux dramatic echoing noises. There's no need for these tricks. I also found the second half of the movie to be rather tame in terms of technique. Most of the shots after the swimming pool scene are rather bland and ordinary. It was as if the director had used up all of his tricks and couldn't think of any others.

All I can say is thank God that Shakespeare's language was used. Without the language there is no reason for this movie to even be made - it turns the story from a ludicrous mob war to the intriguing version of RJ it is now.",pos
RomeoJuliet,If you were a fourteen year old boy...,6/10,André-7,14/11/1999,"My fourteen year old nephew saw this film and loved it! He bought the soundtrack albums, he bought the video cassette. He bought the play. He then rented the Zeffirelli version and rented West Side Story. He then rented a couple of other movies based on other Shakespearean plays. He is now reading Hamlet.

It is so easy to forget that the passions described by Shakespeare are those of teen-agers. It is perhaps equally easy to forget that this is a film adaptation, not the play.

Film has its own rules. The filmmaker has a responsibility not to Shakespeare purists (Orson Welles, Olivier and Kurosawa understood this perfectly) but to the medium and the emotions of the text.

Sure Baz Luhrman's version of this classic play is loud and often obnoxious. Certainly he uses effects that are considered ludicrous outside of a music video (and even then...)-pixilation, freeze frames, undercranking the camera, jump cuts that haven't been around since Jean-Luc Goddard was a young punk... But the point is exactly that! The kids love it! It is wild!

RomeoJuliet,"Romeo + Juliet (1996): Even the ""Gnomeo"" version was Better than This Absolute Garbage!",1/10,davidtkd-25249,31/1/2018,"Romeo + Juliet is a romantic drama film from 1996 starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the titular characters. The film was directed, co-written, and co-produced by Baz Luhrmann.

The plot of the movie follows the original play released in 1597 by William Shakespeare. Nothing really else to say about the plot. If you've read the play, you know what the movie will be about.

There are so many bad things about this movie. First off, the Montagues and Capulets use guns instead of swords as they did in the original play which is absolutely stupid. Why couldn't the cast during filming just get swords and make this movie more like the play they were basing it on? Also, my main problem with the movie is that the whole movie is exact quotations from the book, not normal talking like any normal movie that you've ever seen. I hate this as the movie gets so boring especially with its 2 hour runtime. The acting is terrible, with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. He makes an excellent performance as Romeo Montague.

Overall, I hate this movie. I give it one star because I loved Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. Only watch this movie if you are a die-hard Romeo and Juliet fan or if you love romance movies. Otherwise, skip this one. Many may like, but not for me. A huge dissapointment and I'll probably never watch this movie again.

While this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, this is definitely ONE of the worst! If Shakespeare were alive, he should sue for the butchering of his best play! It would have been better if they had used modern English instead of middle. Sorry, but it was retarded and had a lot of bad acting. ""Put your swords down!"" They were talking about guns! The opening scene by itself was retarded, but I had to watch it because it was part of my teacher's lesson plan. I know I'm ranting, and I apologize, I do have to admit that Leonardo Dicaprio did a pretty good job with his acting, but as a whole, this movie was CRAP! I'm sorry, but I'm not watching this again. I advise people to stay away from it. Stick to any of the other film adaptations and West Side Story.

RomeoJuliet,Single worst movie I HAVE EVER SEEN. Would rather kill myself than watch this sh*t again.,1/10,yellow-pikachu,21/10/2010,"Baz has managed to shove out another overpowering, crummy totally over the top action wannabe. While watching this movie I got the feeling that the director is trying WAY too hard to bring Shakespearian dialect into a modern film. Things Shakespeare should look like Shakespeare. The actors, with the exception of Claire Danes, the only one not over acting, were poorly chosen and the car chase scene at the beginning made the ancient grudge displayed in the original ply look more like a down town drug feud. In my opinion, the single worst film of Leonardo Decaprio's career and I would advise people wanting to see this movie to watch something that actually gets it's meaning across without meaningless violence and anyone who says meaningless crap like 'OMG this is a masterpiece' and 'Baz Lureman - the only man in Hollywood who understands Shakespeare' to wear a blind fold and walk through a bus interchange on a week day at 3:00 and/ or get a bloody life!",neg
RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare messed up!,1/10,johnno74,19/10/2010,"The film is based on one of William Shakespeare's plays about two rival families and one from each family falling in love and their relationship basically causes controversy between the groups. Baz Luhrmann's film is a basic modern version of the Shakespearean play, but the film itself does not work. Luhrmann uses modern clothes and weapons etc, but he has kept the Shakespearean dialogue. The dialogue and the modern elements do not mix together well. The acting is dreadful and immature and the fight scenes are badly choreographed. Nice try for a modern version Luhrmann, but West Side Story is better than this one. Message; Luhrmann shouldn't touch Shakespeare.

RomeoJuliet,I think I'll throw up now!,1/10,nuskin,14/4/2010,"No, they didn't do it right. I've got no problem transporting old stories into a modern setting...sometimes it really works well. Baz didn't make it here. Not once did I ever get the feeling that his cast even understood the old English much less hold a passion for the story or the characters. Even the more mature actors like Sorvino and Dennehy, both of whom I respect deeply, seemed a bit stilted in the delivery of most of their few lines. Anyone who truly knows the meaning of 'wherefore', will absolutely dislike most of the individual performances in this enactment. If you really want to enjoy this story, give up on DiCaprio and Danes and go with Whiting and Hussey in the 1968 Franco Zefferelli version. If you've already tried to give this one a fair shake, watch the other one and really feel the passion!

I'd just like to add, Romeo and Juliet was brought into the 20th century in 1961. It didn't use ""olde englishe"" but it did use music. It was directed by Robert Wise (yes he has also directed Star Trek stuff) and Jerome Robbins. This version won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture. It was called, ""West Side Story"". The Wise/Robbins execution was excellent.",neg
RomeoJuliet,This movie sucked..,1/10,maria_j_spencer,18/1/2010,This movie felt like a bad acid trip. It was the stupidest thing i've ever seen. Where did the E come from.. why is Romeo on E when he meets her. Like COME ON ! whoever likes this movie has to be on crack .. This is a waste of time. do not watch this movie ever unless you have no life what so ever. i wouldn't ever watch this movie again if my life depended on it. Juliet wasn't even pretty. she is supposed to be PRETTY. You don't just fall in love like that. seriously there is no such thing as love at first sight. He obviously just wanted her because he was on drugs. Mercutio was a trannie at the costume party. Lady Capulet was making out with her nephew. This movie was a complete and total mess.,neg
RomeoJuliet,10 reasons to poke yourself in the eye with a stick,2/10,Pigbelly,15/1/2007,"Here are 10 reasons why it would be better to poke yourself in the eye with a stick rather than watch Baz ""I make sh*t for the eyes"" Luhrmann's travesty ""Romeo and Juliet""

1) It is less painful

2) You will feel better about yourself afterward

3) It takes less time

4) You will be more cultured

5) You will lose less brain cells

6) You will still have one eye to see some real Shakespeare

7) Your friends wont laugh at you as much

8) You will have a nice pointy stick to beat the crap out of Baz Luhrmann the next time you see the little moron

9) You will have a nice pointy stick to poke yourself in the other eye instead of watching Baz Luhrmann's next piece of crap

10)You could poke out Baz Luhrmann's eyes instead and save the world from all his MTV tripe and be a HERO!",neg
RomeoJuliet,Great version of Shakespearian play,9/10,davidgoesboating,18/1/2005,"I thought this was a fantastic version of the original Shakespearian play. While, in my opinion, the lead actor Leonardo Di Caprio was good without being brilliant, the others perform magnificently. The soundtrack is possibly the best I've heard. Another credit is that it might actually get kids vaguely interested in Shakespeare (or may not), as at least I have found I can recite some parts of it word for word. Probably the only problems were the title (Romeo and Juliet would have been cool, ""Romeo + Juliet"" sounds really tacky) and some of the slightly strange editing at times. The whole thing of people speaking Shakespearian in a 21st century world seems a bit strange, but in my opinion it works. This film is certainly in my top 10 all time films.

RomeoJuliet,Vibrant and cool; also sort of mediocre...,6/10,MovieAddict2016,2/2/2004,"An entertaining, if seriously flawed, re-telling of Shakespeare's classic tale of young love starring Leonardi DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the infamous duo who sacrificed themselves over true love. Top-notch cast and some crazy modern-day direction by Baz Luhrman (""Moulin Rouge!"") certainly makes for one of the strangest films to ever hit the big screen.

3/5 stars.

RomeoJuliet,An incredible journey of love till death,8/10,Dockelektro,24/11/2000,"In the day this one premiered I as in vacation and had nothing to do. I thought it might be cool so I gave it a try. And the way I felt when I came out was something spectacular. I was still mesmerized by the whole experience, the incredible sets of Verona Beach striking me the most. I got stunned by the power of the actors, the music (one of the best soundtracks of the year), the editing and the direction. I left the theatre with my mouth open and went home thinking a lot about it. I saw it again. And again. I went three times to the cinema to see it. And three years ago, I had a wish of experiencing everything the world of Verona Beach and its two star-crossed lovers had to give: fireworks, lights, coreographed gun fights that look more like ballet dances. This movie influenced me like few movies have. Since then, I remember wishing that someday I took part on the creation of such a world. Now, I have good memories of this movie, and still feel the influence it made on me. But the effect was lost on video. And the really good memory comes from the time I saw it on the theatre. But all isn't lost. The day the DVD arrives to our shores, I know I will experience all the same again... Romeo + Juliet is one of the best movies of the decade, and director Luhrmann is a good hope to the future of sharp movies. I gave it a 8 out of 10, just because of a few flaws in the end, but not to like this movie at all is definitely a crime. Bravo!",pos

RomeoJuliet,It's incredibly painful. So if you like pain...,1/10,ldellevigne,25/5/2018,"Seriously this adaptation is garbage from 1996, should be placed in a time capsule, and that time capsule needs to be destroyed.

Once in a while you see a film from the 80s or 90s and you say ""huh. that really didn't hold up very well.""

Well this one makes all of those look like MASTERPIECES.

Utterly laughable, certainly not timeless, worthy only as an example of the most atrocious acting by big names you'll find from the 1990s.

Just ignore the Shakespeare reference - Baz sure as hell did.

Even if you were to try to accomplish this, you should make it somewhat realistic. The opening scene is absolutely absurd and the whole layout in general. The whole idea of not changing the dialogue is also not a great idea. Why is Mercutio a transgender in the opening scene that he is introduced?

RomeoJuliet,Stupid,1/10,bikelvrgirl,7/7/2017,"Utterly ridiculous. The movie begins with at least 5 straight minutes of redundant, childish mocking between the two opposing houses. The language is not original, but some awkward mix between modern day and Shakespearean language, made even worse by the shirtless punks who use it. The contrast between the language and characters is laughable in most scenarios, with few exceptions. I could not even sit through a quarter of this movie, and had to turn it off. It was unbearable.

RomeoJuliet,Better than expected,7/10,tsel-3,22/7/2006,"Despite the casting of Daines and DeCaprio in the lead roles in this movie, this is not a bad film. Enjoy the performances of the rest of the cast, particularly Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino.

For a fan of Shakespeare, it's interesting to note the way the characters and their voices seamlessly blend into the modern world. The roaming youths of both houses are easily believable as gang bangers, and noble lords easily become wealthy tycoons. The changes in the ages at which we consider marriage does create some dissonance, but so do a number of Shakespeare's plot devices in the modern world. All in all, enjoy the story, and the shiny, and the fluid way that the actors convey the meaning of the archaic dialect.

RomeoJuliet,Romeo + Juliet for the Tarantino generation.,10/10,DaviesJ2006,29/4/2006,"From the all out visual directing of Baz Lurhmann come the 2nd in his trilogy of red carpet movies, Romeo + Juliet. From spaghetti western style shot outs to romantic love scenes, this film has everything; and I mean everything.

Leonardo Di Caprio (Titanic) and Claire Danes (Termnator 3) star as the star crossed lovers in this epic of a film that will last for decades to come. And not only are we gifted with these two giants of the big screen, but this movie has an amazing supporting cast including John Leguizamo (Ice Age 1 & 2) and Harold Perrineau (TV's Lost).

This modern version of the tale of love, tragedy and death will have you glued to your seat. You may know what happens in the book, but this film twists the original story in to film that will be loved by everyone. A must see for all. If you haven't yet seen it, what are you waiting for.

RomeoJuliet,forbidden love revisited,3/10,rebeljenn,23/3/2006,"'Romeo + Juliet' stars Leonardo DiCaprio in an early role as Romeo, before Titanic. This film is an updated version of Shakespeare's play. The good thing about this film is that it brings a classic play into an easy way for our generation to understand the basic theme and story behind it while being as true to the play as it can, giving it a modern face-lift and having it take place in Verona Beach, Florida instead of Italy. Despite using the classic scenario about a forbidden and romantic love in modern times, the original play still appealed to me more, and I also preferred the 1969 film based on the original story. Still, it's not bad, but it is not good either.

RomeoJuliet,The Best Story Ever,8/10,JoshtheGiant,22/12/2005,"The chemistry of Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes, is one of the best for years. They seem made to act together, I hope they will do something more. I have to say if it had not all been in Shakespearian, it would have made it make more sense, half the time you had trouble understanding what there saying, except for Dicaprio, he has a knack for Shakespeare, his performance also shows what he feels and you almost don't have to get his dialogue strait, you can just look at his bodie language. Its Claire Danes best performance since The Rainmaker with Matt Damon. The rest of the actings not so great, but because of Dicaprio and Danes, its definitely worth your two hours of time. So rent it, even if your a Leo hater. I have always thought it annoying that some people will not like an actor, like, Leonardo Dicaprio, or Orlando Bloom, just because there the ones all the girls have a crush on. It's no reason to hate them just because there better looking then you. Great Movie.

RomeoJuliet,"Very good, but could have been better",9/10,DaftPenguu,20/6/2005,"I am still young, and still love the story of Romeo and Juliet. This might change, as some people have said on the message boards, as I grow older, but that is not the case right now.

I think that this presentation was very good. They adapted it well to a more modern setting. However, there were two major things that irked me.

The fights, to me, were far too stylized. This kind of thing just annoys me. I felt it should have been more violent, less ... cartoonish.

And the biggest thing that I have a problem with is Juliet's death. I love how the director has Romeo dying just as Juliet waking, I feel that was a good choice and a very dramatic one. However, there is significance in Juliet bringing a dagger to her heart. It is not the same when she blows her brains out. The story loses a lot with the way it is in this movie. This should have not been changed, it is far too big symbolically.

I also want to mention the music. The music is excellent! It fits the scenes, and is a nice mix of popular music and classical style. One of the reasons why I can forgive some of the annoyances.

It is one my favorite movies, even with my complaints.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Romeo and Juliet, a classic in every form",9/10,smartlittlegirl2000,8/5/2005,"I find it incredible how people today cannot appreciate the beauty of speech. In Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet, using Spakespeare's original text help the EDUCATED viewer understand the deep sub-text. Perhaps a person who has not studied Shakespeare will not understand that using a modern day situation, with Shakespeare's text, teaches the audience on cruel fate and how it can affect anyone.

Allowing stereotypes to fill the persona of Montague and Capulet helps conceive the viewing of one true love and destiny. Two groups, so different can still hold and give forth love for each other. Seeing this in a mainstream movie may be able to help this new generation that holds true to a split society.

To people who have reviewer this movie with negative comments: When writing a piece that that public may view, be sure to use a polite and professional tone.

Sincerely, Jade",pos
RomeoJuliet,Didn't work,3/10,lists-9,26/1/2002,"Had to post this. I've kept reading (since MOULIN ROUGE was released) what a genius Baz Luhrmann is, but I have to say I was disappointed with this. Maybe it's possible to set Shakespeare in the present day, but on this evidence, it just doesn't work. I watched the film on a rented DVD. I don't know the play well, and on occasions lost track of what was happening, so I tried to follow the text in my Complete Works of Shakespeare. It seemed to me that there were lots of passages of INVENTED Shakespearean verse - or did I just imagine this? Apart from the failure to convey the emotion that's vital to this story, there were examples throughout where the modern setting made nonsense of the story. At the crux of it all, I couldn't help asking myself why Pete Postlethwaite didn't tell Claire Danes ""Now shallst thou to thy mobile phone ... Go and inform thy Romeo of our deed""! thus averting the tragedy and saving us from a truly feeble rendition of the climax. To me, the Zeffirelli version was better on every level.

RomeoJuliet,Romeo + Juliet is a very awful and annoying movie that is a pain to sit through.,1/10,scullyuk-54662,27/8/2017,"The main problems with this movie is the directors style, which is generally a cringe worthy mix of something you would expect to find on MTV combined with a YouTube video where the editor had just discovered all of the effects. Just in the beginning scene alone, there's a scary number of consistent annoying zooms into close ups and the scene consistently interchanging between normal and slow motion. Instead of helping to progress the story, as any good film should, it instead gets in the way of the story, feeling as if the director was more worried about showing of his previously mentioned style and trying to be noticed instead of creating a good film adaptation of Shakespeare's work.

The film then plummets to an even more more intolerable level as it reaches its first talking scene. Not only does the pacing of the film majorly slow but you realise that all the dialogue is written in old English. This makes some of the performances seem very flat because it is as if the actors don't actually know what they are talking about.

Overall, this film isn't worried about its story but instead, it is constantly distracting you from it with the director trying to say ""Look at me and my style"". This makes the film very hard to sit through due to its cringe worthy style, weak performances and uneven pacing.",neg
RomeoJuliet,An annoying movie of a classic story,2/10,andreasringsby,30/5/2017,"I ended up watching this movie with my class, because my teacher said that it was such a great story. Off course everyone had heard about the story, but no one had seen the movie. However, It was not the original movie we saw. Nope, we ended up watching the modernized 1996 version of Romeo and Juliet, and the first thing I saw was Jamie Kennedy as a colorful punk with pink hair. When he is introduced before Leonardo De Caprio, screaming around with his punk friends I already knew that the movie will be annoying.

And I was right.

If I would describe this movie whit one word it would be ""annoying""! The original dialogue from the original story is put into this modern time movie, something that does not work at all. The acting is decent, while all the emotions to different characters is everywhere.

Would not really say that this is any great movie to watch, not the worst movie I have seen, but it is annoying enough to give it a 2/10 stars.

RomeoJuliet,"Set in the present day, but with 16th c dialogue!",1/10,DavidYZ,17/4/2017,"The way Shakespeare wrote is so far removed from modern English that it's like a different language. When I tried to read his work, I needed to often refer to a book which translated words and phrases of that time into modern English. I had to refer to it so many times that it made reading any one of his plays a long, slow and tiresome task. I was very pleased when I heard that a modern remake of Romeo and Juliet was being made, so that I would be able to understand it without translation. I was puzzled and very disappointed when I watched it and it was in the original dialogue! It had already been filmed many times in its original dialogue and 16th century setting. What's the point in setting it in the present day if you're going to use archaic dialogue?!

RomeoJuliet,Glittering Carbon-Copy...,6/10,ElMaruecan82,26/3/2017,"Movies like ""Moulin Rouge!"" (or more recently, ""La La Land"") are so lavishly designed and stylishly directed that the simplicity of their stories is no coincidence, they are well-crafted forms of entertainment meant to arouse emotions rather than thoughts.

Indeed, while I'm not a professional on editing or filmmaking, what I gathered from years of cinematic dedication is that complex, multi-layered, character-driven stories generally call for straightforward directing, so that the form doesn't distract from the content. In other words, there's a time for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and another for ""Chinatown"", and I can't think of a good movie that is both exceedingly directed and written (with the exception of ""Citizen Kane"").

Can we take for granted that people know ""Romeo and Juliet"" so well that a few artistic licenses won't hurt, or are actually needed? Is it such an iconic story that it can sustain every narrative form without undermining the emotional bingo of the end? Well, I'm not sure the story is self-sufficient, while watching Leo as Romeo (talk about predestination in that rhyming) challenging Tybalt (John Leguizamo), shouting Shakespeare's lines with such passion I could hardly understood what he said, I was wondering if the movie wouldn't have worked as well or better had they been swords instead of guns, Verona instead of Verona Beach and good old Renaissance as the time setting.

And it's precisely because Leonardo Di Caprio was an excellent Romeo, in his pre-""Titanic"" fame years with the youthful charm, the wide-eyed innocence, the eyebrow-raising enthusiasm and penetrating sadness, he was a baby-faced young man who could easily pass as a teenager. The rest of the casting was competent, honorable mention to Leguizamo who looked as passionately angry as his 1968 counterpart Michael York, and to Paul Sorvino and Pete Postlewhaite. Claire Danes paled in comparison but not to the point of ruining the film. What did spoil the film a little was actually its own reason to be, Baz Lhurmann!"" thought that Shakespeare's romance needed a rejuvenation treatment, as if it wasn't modern enough for younger audiences.

The problem is that the story has been modernized already, like Kurosawa made adaptations of ""Macbeth"" and ""King Lear"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" inspired good movies like ""West Side Story"" or ""China Girl"", love stories with a gang war as the backdrop. In fact any interesting romance inevitably revolves around star-crossed lovers, any romance owes a bit to ""Romeo and Juliet"" which owed to all the romantic heritage of the past centuries. So you either remake ""Romeo and Juliet"" or you adapt it, there is rarely an in-between solution. Lurhmann took the challenge and it's laudable, but his ""Romeo + Juliet"" couldn't be a total remake or it would have been a second ""West Side Story"", it was doomed to be half-Shakespeare, half-something else.

And the problem is that the text didn't match the setting, no matter how hard it tried like replacing the narrator by a TV announcer. It was so busy reminding you that this is the Shakespeare play in its academic version (same lines) that it became unchained to its premise, while in any of the previous adaptations; the romance was the focal point, not its kinship with the original story. It came to the point that the 'Trainspotting'-like editing, the pop music, the opera, the shootouts, the awkward mix between modern settings and Renaissance-expressions becomes a sort of gimmick that overshadowed the story. The form detracted from the story, and the heart of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the story. If you're not emotionally involved, it's over.

And the film could still win the audiences, had it not ruined the very scenes that could create the emotional involvement, through some bizarre experimentation. I didn't care for the 1968 version until the balcony scene; Olivia Hussey's youthful beauty, the purity of Nino Rota's score, the interactions between the young lovers, the film won because of that scene. So, I expected the balcony scene to enhance ""Romeo + Julier"" but Lurhmann had to introduce the novelty of the swimming pool. What was he thinking? If you're going to stick to the play, don't ruin the most iconic part. How can someone be focused on loving while he's also trying to float in the water. Forget what I said, the whole thing just looked awkward and as sincere as the actors were in their intent to play ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's like Lurhmann had another movie in mind.

The film was a success but it was out-shined by the Leo's following hit, the one that put him in Hollywood map forever and ever; ""Titanic"" the year after, interestingly, this was a tale of forbidden love that was closer in spirit and in heart to ""Romeo and Juliet"" than ""Lurrhman's jukebox. And Claire Danes, with all due respect, is no Kate Winslet. Leo is a real romantic actor but the real star of Baz Lurhmann's film was Baz Lurhmann. His unique jukebox-styled directing fitted ""Moulin Rouge!"" but as far as ""Romeo + Juliet"" goes, it's still an entertaining little movie, that nostalgic of the 90's will cherish. For me, it's the film of that ""Love Fool"" song and I have it on my playlist.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Nope,3/10,Mr-Fusion,19/8/2016,"It's obvious from the start that ""Romeo + Juliet"" is Baz Luhrmann's stab at making the story relevant to the '90s, and I can appreciate that. Hell, if it weren't for 10th grade English class, who knows if I'd ever try my luck at Shakespeare? He's not the most accessible author around.

But the execution is way off. Warring families are updated to street gangs and swords are branded as guns (literally), but the dialogue is strictly Elizabethan era. Those words and the contemporary setting do not mix. At all. It's especially jarring in the opening scenes with the spazzed-out gangbangers. This is a movie packaged for the MTV crowd; the direction's cartoonish, the style frenetic and any soul this story had is lost in translation.

It's bad.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare turned Stupid,5/10,ed-co-uk,31/7/2016,"Based on the classic Shakespeare play, this version of the story took almost every part of this play away to replace it with mainstream crowd pleasing sewage.

The original play was the tragic story of two 18th century children who fell in love over the course of three days. This is a average modern love story poorly disguising itself as something better. This is not the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet that resulted in six deaths (including Paris being brutally and pointlessly slain by Romeo in rage), this is a poorly made dumb-ed down version of a story which once carried respect. The actors don't do poor jobs in the film but the script replaces the original text's interesting well written characters with stereotypes. The direction is so over the top with pointless zooms and poor attempts are dramatic cinematography in a hope to keep a simple minded viewer getting bored that it becomes funny.

This was a film that had a decent cast and a classic script but due to pathetically bad decisions about who the play should be aimed at, it failed miserably.",neg

It's so bad I have no Idea what to say. Doing some sort of a ""modern"" version of Romeo & Juliet just doesn't work this way, the dialogue just doesn't fit and everything feels so TOO out of place.

Leonardo & Claire are really trying their best when it comes to acting and kudos to them but the script, the filming and cut is just terrible. The only reason I can understand this film became popular was on the classic tale of Romeo & Juliet and that Leonardo DiCaprio was every teenage girls dream back then.

But as a film this is just a catastrophe!

RomeoJuliet,Modern Shakespeare???,2/10,Manya086,17/10/2015,"This modern attempt of Shakespeare's famous Romeo & Juliet was a failure. The Shakespearean language in a modern setting do not mix! If director, Baz Luhrmann, wanted to modernize Shakespeare to appeal to a younger generation, he or the writers should have modernized to language too.

The performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were less than average. As the star-crossed lovers they lacked on screen chemistry. Their individual performances were fair, but considering this was early in their respective careers, I am willing to overlook it. Though I must admit, I am a fan of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes work, but this was not their best. Furthermore, what pains me is the iconic ending scene; it made no impact on me whatsoever.

Overall, Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet is a disgrace to Shakespeare. I would be ashamed to have this film credited to my name.",neg

But good job on the chosen actor and actress that played Romeo and Juliet. Though you made them look more stupid than they already are with the way they both committed suicide.

RomeoJuliet,Bill Clinton's Shakespeare,5/10,Fluke_Skywalker,5/4/2015,"Though it's based on a 400 year old play, this movie is more 90s than Bill Clinton in a pair of Zubaz pants singing Hootie and the Blowfish songs. That's not really a knock so much as an observation.

It's certainly visually impressive, and an intriguing and fresh spin on one of Shakespeare's most widely adapted works, but the actors deliver the admittedly tricky dialog with all the eloquence of someone speaking Klingon with a mouthful of mashed potatoes.

Like the president himself, I don't know that this Clinton-era adaptation still holds up as something ""cool"", but if it has worked as a gateway to Shakespeare for Gen X then I suppose that's not a bad legacy.

RomeoJuliet,This version of Romeo and Juliet can be interpreted in different ways.,7/10,awellmon,22/3/2015,"I recently watched this version of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". I did like it but there were parts that should have been done differently. I like the actors, I like how it is modernized and I like the original story of ""Romeo and Juliet"". I thought that in the beginning of the movie, there was a lot going on and that the movie would be hard to follow. After a little bit, I started to be able to understand what was going on and the movie got better. I also disliked how everything is modern except for how they are speaking. Some may find it funny but I don't. I would have preferred only certain parts to have the original writing. Although that is my opinion, I understand why it is written the way it is. If William Shakespeare wrote a book instead of a play, the movie would have modern day words, but it was written as a play, so it is spoken the way the play would have been. I would recommend you see this movie. I would also read the play and watch a different version of the movie. I feel like if you do that you get to see what you think things would look like, and what people interpreted everything to look like. I also feel that if you only read the play and watch one version you have nothing to compare to and some people may prefer another version over the other. I prefer the 1960's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" mainly because that is sort of how I pictured the play to look like. I hope this helped you decide if you are going to watch this movie or not.",pos
RomeoJuliet,No one even understands their own lines,1/10,graplano,27/5/2014,"Have you ever seen a bad TV actor pretending to be a bad stage actor? Flat, overloud delivery, incorrect emphasis, with a kind of fake British accent, but utterly disconnected from the meaning of what they were saying? Lines declaimed rather than feelingly spoken?

That is what we have here. Just an awful raw butchery of the Bard.

I have seen a lot of experimental Shakespeare, including a brilliant sarcastic, zoot-suited version of Troilus and Cressida at the Folger, and an Idaho Shakespeare ""sixties Hippy"" version of Midsummer Night's dream, I do like the idea of what they were attempting. Unfortunately, they gathered actors/actresses who were not up to the job. The worst rendition of any Shakespeare I have ever seen outside of awful Merchant of Venice in the local Shakespeare festival in Boise Idaho back in 1999.

I truly do not believe that any of the actors understood even half of what they were supposed to be saying.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Yuck- Shakespeare Would Not Be Pleased,2/10,sciullzlovescoco,22/5/2014,"We're watching this movie in my English class, and to put it lightly, it's pretty horrendous. The idea itself of adapting one of Shakespeare's works is astounding and takes great talent and care, but if done poorly, the results end just like the play- tragic.

My first issue is the fact that the characters are speaking in Elizabethan English, which completely boggles my mind. Not only does it make the whole thing utterly confusing and unrealistic, it also heavily damages the point of modernizing the play at all. Another thing that bothered me about the play was how Luhrmann seemed so eager to cleverly adapt the play that he pretty much tried to throw in every ""modern"" thing he could think of- fast cars, gunfights, drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, obnoxious parties, loud punk music and street violence; all taking place in a rundown, scummy tourist attraction by the beach. He pretty much included everything but the kitchen sink, which not only makes the movie cliché, but it also ruins any chance of the movie to be seen as ""edgy"" instead of ridiculous.

Asides from that, there's not much else, besides actors who either don't fit their part or can barely speak their lines. Often both. DiCaprio might be in this movie, but that doesn't make it any better, especially with his co-star, whose acting was about was vibrant as a dishcloth. Way too many transition effects in the movie, which make it extremely hard to watch the screen without getting a migraine. The only thing I enjoyed was the beautiful backdrops of the Capulet home, especially by the poolside. I also enjoyed Mercutio and his antics, and that was pretty much the only thing I found entertaining.

Overall, watch the 1968 version instead and don't waste your time!",neg
RomeoJuliet,Poor,4/10,savagehouseparty,9/1/2012,"We studied this movie last year in English and I have to say, I did not find it as interesting, as well done or as breathtaking as many others who I know that have watched it. If you loved this movie, please hear me out before accusing me of being a hater or anything like that. 1. The action scenes were overdone. Luhrmann tries much too hard to make the action scenes that of a blockbuster, using over the top acting and unnecessary high angle shots. 2. I am the first to say that Shakespeare was a genius, but I thought that the inclusion of the original text did not go hand in hand with the modern day style of the film very well. 3. Claire Danes is far from impressive in the role of Juliet. 4. I found the almost incestuous relationship between Tybalt and Juliet's mother a little weird and stupid, really. However, there were some redeeming factors to this otherwise poor film 1. Leonardo DiCaprio acts well. 2. The costume design is done tastefully 3. Radiohead is in the soundtrack. All up, I found the film a poor representation of William Shakespeare's iconic classic.

RomeoJuliet,Awful.,1/10,ariedel13,22/11/2011,"This movie was terrible. I would give it a 0 out of 10. But there is not zero button. Worst 2 hours of my life. This movie was the total opposite of romeo and Juliet! 1. They did not have guns! 2. Nobody talks like that in 1996! 3. Get your settings straight! last i checked There was no cars or hotels or GUNS in romeo and Juliet! If you are even considering watching this movie. Don't waist your time. I don't even want to get into the ending of the movie. worst one ever! Baz Luhrmann should not make a movie ever again! I don't even know what he was thinking when he made this movie. It ruined my whole romeo and Juliet experience. So next time your going to the movies and the director is Baz Luhrmann. I strongly suggest not seeing the movie.

RomeoJuliet,Horrible!!,1/10,dineen_322,21/11/2011,"Spoiler alert? This movie sucks. It was horrible. If anyone has actually read the play or seen the original movie, it seems that the 1996 version is a mockery of the story. It's 1996 and they are using Elizabethan language at a beach? Really? Cause that makes a lot of sense. It's cheesy and pathetic to watch. Also, how can somebody be banished in 1996??? Last time I checked it's called ""arrested"". This was probably the dumbest movie I have ever had to watch in my entire life and I believe William Shakespeare would be embarrassed that this is what came out of his beautiful work. Nothing about this movie fit. I speak for my entire class when I say, I would like to hit Baz in the face and give him a reality check.",neg
RomeoJuliet,"A beautiful, unconventional adaptation full of raw emotion",9/10,hyper777,12/3/2010,"This is an incredible adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. It's wild and unconventional and ridiculous, and that's what makes it so good. The director, Baz Luhrmann, knows that he's going out of the realm of what most people would consider to be a great screen adaptation of this play, and he uses that to its full advantage. This isn't just Shakespeare for a Shakespeare-reading audience, it's easily accessible and enjoyable whether or not you've read the play or can understand the full meaning behind each line. The direction and scenery is raw and unpretentious; the modern setting means it doesn't distract you with elaborate costumes or historical accuracies, just lets the pure emotion of the story come through. It really brings across the point that this type of story resonates through every time period and every generation, and can mean just as much to a modern audience as it did in Shakespeare's time.

The performances in this movie are incredible, much more so than in any other version of this play, stage or screen, that I've ever seen. Harold Perrineau plays infamous entertainer Mercutio with both dramatic flair and emotional intensity, and brings the character to life in a way that I believe Shakespeare himself would have appreciated (whether or not he would agree with the fact that he was dressed as a drag queen at a point in the movie), and John Leguizamo's Tybalt is appropriately fiery and sneering while bringing an interesting humanity to this typically villainous character.

The leads also turn out stunning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were perfectly casted as these star-crossed lovers, and they embody their youth and naiveté in a way that, for the teenage audience watching this film, makes it feel fresh and personal. They speak Shakespearan dialogue with a raw, unpracticed ease, bringing to mind the way that these young lovers would have really spoken. Leo's Romeo is every bit as perfectly over-the- top and romantic as one might expect, and he handles both sweet, intense and tragic scenes with a realness that tears at your heart. Claire's Juliet has that same quality, and she lends even iconic lines (""Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"") a new twist.

All in all, don't judge this movie by its cover. A modern version of Romeo + Juliet featuring gunfights and costume parties might not be for everyone, but it stays so true to the genuine, relatable themes of the play that the backdrop can't possibly impair your enjoyment.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Very beautiful movie if you can get over the anachronistic dialog,10/10,arochom,11/3/2010,"Yes it is Shakespeare, and it is perfect, yet not for now. I have to say I fell in love with the two actors, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. A perfect team. I had tears in my eyes, as Shakespeare would appreciate. I am writing this as a spoiler, but I think we all how it goes, and I was wishing so much for a little artistic curve, but no, of course not, it was a very faithful rendering of the Bard's play despite the contemporary setting. I loved this movie. I can totally get why Leonardo is one of the best actors out there. Anyway, those families have had what is coming to them. The Sheriff was way to kind to those ridiculous, pretentious families.",pos
RomeoJuliet,A powerful idea exploits the dark mind of Shakespeare,9/10,Stampsfightclub,24/1/2010,"When Romeo Montague (Di Caprio) falls in love with Juliet Capulet (Danes) their families' rivalries escalate in the fair city of Verona.

William Shakespeare's tragic love play gets a dramatic current world make over in this vigorous and boisterous film that at 14 years old is still relevant, still powerful and will continue to be used in education to get the points of powerful politics and freestyle love across.

At the time of its release we were in a state of film where violence was everything. Pulp Fiction had dazzled and outraged people all over the world a few years previously, True Romance in comparison to this 1996 picture had a brave love at first sight plot with bloody violence that Baz Luhrmann capitalized on to make a brutally fine adaptation.

The film opens tremendously, capturing the whole film in essence with a fast montage of shots and an anticipation of what is to come. The TV fading away with a news report is the last thing you would expect from a Shakespeare work but what is more unusual is what is to follow.

Pulling up at a gas station members of the Capulet family have a violent confrontation in a shoot out with members from the Montague household. Guns, gas and gross misconduct may be as violent and as the famous playwright intended and to implement his words into this modern telling is a startling contrast and personally, I believe this is such an important technique to making this film so exciting and universally unique.

What the director has done is comprehend modern trends. He followed the trend of current cinema so that we could all appreciate the context and by taking the words of Shakespeare has made it easier to comprehend, a startling technique that has been such a beneficiary to school exams and also for pure viewing pleasure. Whilst it has been many years since I have read the play and studied it for my G.C.S.E's I recall watching and being baffled and now more years on I can still appreciate how powerful and how spoken this picture is.

The work that has been achieved here is spoken through its various stars with Leonardo Di Caprio made a sex symbol and Claire Danes going on with more romantic roles. Their first meeting in the film through a fish tank is beautifully choreographed, a section that doesn't feel too cheesy thanks to the calm playing of the song 'Kissing You'.

The love at first sight ideology has been worked to death in modern cinema in romantic comedy dramas and here it is tackled as in Shakespeare's mind, as pure and as lust that is crossed with startling rivalry.

The film boasts a courageous soundtrack revelling in gorgeous settings that do justice to a story so strong, and yet so dark. This is a great film, taking a tragic story and turning into a modern telling of love repression and violence.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Enjoyable film,10/10,helenekim,2/12/2009,"I have watched this film probably around 20 times and still enjoy it like my first experience every time. I like the acting, dialogue and story line. It has obviously been directed wonderfully and the film expresses this. The whole concept of this film is enjoyable and i have even had people enjoy this who hate romantic films. The actors simply show passion in a great way and develop a personality that you can identify with which increases the enjoyment significantly. The props, setting and environment completely do the film justice. I absolutely love the fact the film still uses the original dialogue this is what makes the film so unique. I would advise anyone who likes Shakespeare's work, or even just likes a good old romantic film to watch this film. It helps that I simply love anything directed by Baz Luhrmann.

RomeoJuliet,A definition of love,10/10,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,20/6/2009,"So, a classic play with a modern setting? Can it be done? No. If Baz is the director? Yes! This movie could not have been made by anyone else. Claire Danes (beautiful angel costume, compliments to Catherine Martin) shines as Juliet. She isn't the traditional Juliet that the play was originally sexist towards her character. She's got emotion and adds more into Juliet than no one ever did. When Juliet committed suicide, that facial expression into the camera was so strong and memerorizing, as is the film. I cried like a baby whilst watching it. Leonardo Di Caprio is perfect as Romeo, being a today teenager and an Elizabethen teenager at the same time. With an amazing kissing scene, Romeo+ Juliet wins in originality. It's well acted, and the deaths are done really well and the suicide scene defines love and the true meaning of it.",pos
RomeoJuliet,An awesome classic!,10/10,pitajean007,11/5/2009,"I saw this movie when it first came out. I loved it then and I love it even more now. I can watch this movie over and over again. To me it will never get old. The reason why this movie is good is because when watching it the movie does not feel ""dated."" That is why it can withstand the test of time.

The reasons why it can withstand the test of time is because of the way the movie was shot. The scenery, and the costumes are gorgeous! Every time I see this movie it makes me understand the play and Shakespeare's writing and words. Baz Luhrmann did a perfect job directing. Even the way how the actors are speaking word by word of the play does not make it bad. It makes the movie better. I feel all the actors make this a great ensemble movie.

I love it and that's why I gave this movie a 10/10.

RomeoJuliet,"Hard to Love, Hard to Hate",5/10,Slipstream720,12/6/2008,"I watched this in my 7th Grade Reading class, and I have to say it was better than some of the others we've watched. I got quite emotional at some scenes, and it tells an epic story. My complaints include that the gunfights were low-budget by today's standards, and the fact that they were speaking OLD FREAKING English! I know that the original story was told written in Victorian times by Shakespeare and that it added to the atmosphere, but if they decided to tell this story in modern day Verona Beach, they could have updated the dialogue. I feel that another retelling of this with modern language and more action would do very well.

RomeoJuliet,Pure art and infinitely watchable,7/10,gcd70,30/5/2008,"Is Baz Luhrmann a master artist? Perhaps so. After his flamboyant, colourful and often riotous debut with ""Strictly Ballroom"", which dazzled many audiences and captured the heart of Australian humour, many would have said yes. Now it seems that goes double after his latest creation, especially for this film lover.

I must say ""Strictly Ballroom"" did not exactly floor me when I saw it first, my expectations being higher than my appreciation. In hindsight though I can see what a clever stroke of originality it was. This time Luhrmann has boldly remade ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"", and again my expectations were high. Yet this time they were completely fulfilled.

Mr. Luhrmann has fashioned an incredible piece of cinema, modernising the old bard's famous tragedy and proving that it is truly timeless. His flamboyance and flair again shows, and early on in the film our director almost over indulges with his little extravagances. Then again the opening scenes do rather set the mood for what is a fantastic eye-fest of colour and light as we are treated to superlative sets, incredible art direction and magnificent costumes form Kym Barrett. In fact it is ingenious that the poetry of the visual goes hand in hand with the original, virtually unaltered text. of the heart rending play.

Renowned editor Jill Bilcock (""Evil Angels"") does a marvellous job, as does cinematographer Donald McAlpine, brilliantly capturing some stunning, innovative shots of Luhrmann's gorgeous action. This is pure art, infinitely watchable.

Finally there is the cast, who can make or break a movie in which acting is of paramount import. And they make it! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal Romeo, and his dramatic scenes are truly convincing and very strong, making us believe all his anguish and sorrow. Fabulous too is pretty Juliet, the thoroughly charming and captivating Claire Danes who has no trouble making us believe that she would surely die for her beloved Romeo. The support is tops too, with John Leguizamo especially sinister as Tybalt, Juliet's cousin and ""Prince of Cats"". Romeo's good friend Mercutio is played well by Harold Perrineau, with Jesse Bradford as Balthasar (Romeo's aide) and Paul Rudd as the dashing Paris who would woo Juliet if she would have him. Miriam Margoyles is most enjoyable as young Juliet's nurse-maid, as is Pete Postlethwaite as the priest who tries so desperately to help the star-crossed lovers. The heads of each household, played by Brian Dennehy and Christina Pickles (as the Montagues) and Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora (Capulets), have little to do, but they do impress in the few scenes they have.

Please go and see this at the cinema.........................now!

Wednesday, February 12, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema

Luhrmann's elaborate, colourful, in your face interpretation of Shakespeare's timeless tragedy was bold to say the least. But it comes off! All the visual splendour loses a lot in the transition to the small screen, but as a piece of entertainment it is still quite a work.

All technical credits, including cinematography, editing, set design and costumes, are outstanding, and the vibrant pop soundtrack adds aural colour. Acting is the film's strongest suit with DiCaprio and Danes leading the way, both giving emotionally strong showings. The support cast also deliver with special mention to John Leguizamo as the obsessive Tybalt and Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Lawrence.

I strongly recommend a trip to the cinema for this or any Baz Luhrmann flick.

RomeoJuliet,Nicely Done,8/10,mariolover,8/3/2008,"Just recently, I saw the 1968 version of Shakespeare's classic. And I hated it. Therefore, I was convinced that this adaptation would be no better. However, I heard nice things about it, and decided to rent it.

Well. I was pleasantly surprised. What emotions I lacked while viewing the older one, or even reading the play, I felt while watching this movie. I think it takes a lot to make Shakespeare feel relevant to a modern teen, but Baz Luhrman managed to do this.

The acting is superb. I love Claire Danes, and it was nice to see what she is capable of. Of course, I already know that Leo can act. And the twist on the ending was brilliant. Throughout the last twenty minutes or so, I found myself hoping against hope that maybe this could have a happy ending. Of course, we all know how it ends, and happy is one thing it isn't.

I do have some complaints, though. Parts of this movie were just...well, weird. Don't get me started on Mercutio. But if you can handle the edgy strangeness, you should definitely watch this movie.",pos
RomeoJuliet,I never realised how good the bard was.,10/10,crappydoo,6/3/2008,"Oh my God, that was one hell of a head trip. I had seen the movie way back in 1996 but being naive couldn't understand anything and thought that it was a waste of good money. But this time around, I was left astounded and have been thinking about the movie all morning.

The movie moves at a brisk pace and does not drone unnecessarily. But perhaps the play itself is well paced, I'm not aware since I haven't read it yet.

It is a courageous attempt on the part of the director and full marks to him and his film makers for their imagination and creativity. Great acting and cinematography too. Highly recommended.

I used to hate Shakespeare in school but this movie has developed an interest in me now and I think I will read a little more of him.

I must say that watching the film on DVD with subtitles is pretty helpful since the Shakespearean dialogue and poetry takes a few moments to get your head across.",pos

RomeoJuliet,"Great acting, cinematography, soundtrack and story- who could ask for more!",10/10,adedavies,18/11/2007,"You would be forgiven for expecting this film to be just a love story best suited to the more feminine viewer. Of course the star crossed lovers story is here but there is enough pace and testosterone to entertain those who want action too.

Set in the modern day the swords are guns and the horses, cars but this only adds to an appreciation of the drama of this timeless story. The adaptations of the original play are both creative and witty. Shakespearian language is still used but don't let that put you off, you quickly get used to it.

The acting is without fault, particularly for the lead roles. At times it even feels a little uncomfortable to be witnessing such powerful emotions.

The cinematography is stylish and dazzling; many scenes are truly unforgettable just for the photography. I think that Donald M. McAlpine adopts a similar vivid approach he did later for Moulin Rouge but I found this to be less flamboyant.

The sound track complements the visual feast. The music is varied and powerful- adding to the pace and texture of the storyline.

Baz Luhrmann is worthy of huge acclaim in that he directed and produced this great film and also wrote the screenplay with Craig Pearce.

I write this comment in 2007 and my appreciation of this classic is no less now then as when I saw it first 9 years ago. 10/10.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Brilliance,10/10,dosomeeffingscience,24/8/2007,"Romeo And Juliet has been examined and appraised for over 400 years, and I have nothing to add to all that discussion. But I do know the play is such a monument that anyone bringing it to stage or screen will either do it justice or screw it up.

So, what of Baz Luhrmann's rendition? All I can say is it's wonderful. Just, wonderful.

Like any film it has its flaws, but so what? The 'modern' look and sound will please some and annoy others (I didn't like it much); but in a hundred years nobody will care for or against that.

This film should be remembered for two scenes: the birth of the love between Romeo and Juliet, and their unhappy end. Forget all the melodrama in-between, good bad or indifferent. The only thing that counts is that both those scenes are done well enough to give the other one its meaning and emotional impact.

I can't speak for anyone else of course but, for myself, I have never seen those two scenes done so convincingly as they are in this film. I don't know or care how it was done, whether it was Shakespeare, Luhrmann, or the blinding talent of Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. What I do know is, it was done damn near to perfection.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Indefinite Love,8/10,je_taimealafolie,22/7/2007,"""I Love Thee."" Love, Amor, Aroha. Love, love, love, love, love. What is this so called love? Baz Luhrman's version of Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet' can answer that question for you. Bursting with many different loves from arranged love to forbidden love, forbidden to doomed love, to name a few, and portrayed in such fine detail along with its amazing cast such as Leonardo Dicaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet who both play the love scenes with immense passion and ease, giving its audience a taste of what true love really is. This is truly ""A film that will kick you in the heart.

This is a powerful story of chaos, fate and above all, love. Set in a modernized Verona, where daggers, rapiers and swords are used as brand names for guns. A place where you will see guys dressed in Hawaiian shirts, cars with speed and police men with a modern look, who and which are all surprisingly relevant to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet script. But most importantly, it is a story of two young star-crossed lovers who meet at a party and fall deeply in love, but then find out that they belong to families who have been enemies for a period of time. This love the two lovers, Romeo and Juliet have, is then kept a secret which becomes more and more difficult to hold on to leading to the most brutal things.

From the scene with the aquarium where Romeo and Juliet first encounter each other to the 'blue' and tragic ending, the love stayed alive and stole my heart. The love in this updated movie was way to powerful to keep anybody's tear drops in place and it definitely was worth the sniffs and the subterfuge of hiding behind the sentence ""I just finished yawning."" An idea in the movie relevant to love, that I LOVED, was the use of water. I see the water is Romeo and Juliet's love world, Romeo and Juliet first meet at a fish tank where they start flirt, Romeo and Juliet fall in pool and start kissing etc. But I also see the water as dangerous in some way, Tybalt dies in water, families drenched in rain, which shows and tells me that you shouldn't get involved with Romeo and Juliet and their love, or you will pay.

This film truly is an amazing movie and I could just see all the time, effort and hard work that was put into making this just by watching it. If five stars meant ""Very Very Good"", then the eight stars I give this movie would just show how much love I have for it. ""Did my heart love 'till now?"" (Romantic movies that is), why yes, yes it did, thanks to this version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The strongest love story ever told.",pos
RomeoJuliet,good movie,9/10,cutie_pie_kkk,28/6/2007,"this movie is a perfect admission of how good baz luhrman is. when i was in my first year of ncea we studied this movie and it really opened my eyes to how great filmatography this movie is showed in. Leonardo is the main reason that most people watch this movie and i agree he was the main reason i liked this movie originally but after a while you can realize that he makes this movie just so much like Shakespeare that its worth it. Claire Danes as a Juliet is perfrectly casted and makes her seem like a role model to many little girls. she may not be a very good role model what with being in a tragedy and all but its still worth it. Romeo and Juliet is a tearful movie that fits the wishes of being a Chick-flick through and through. the soundtrack on this movie is brilliant to all the changes that comes through. the perfectly shown differences between the Montague's and Capulet's. a 9out of 10 movie and i want to see it again

RomeoJuliet,Bravo!,9/10,chrisvoffshore,6/6/2007,"Nowadays there is much criticism of lemming movie makers that follow the herd.

Well, here is an example of fresh, original movie-making that takes perhaps the most famous love story of all and gives it a unique treatment. Good on you, Mr. Luhrmann!

I'd like to take issue with those that excoriated this film - did you not know before you bought your ticket you were going to watch Romeo and Juliet set in a modern-day California with guns and stuff? If you didn't, that's too bad. It's like going on a roller-coaster and then complaining you got the heevy-jeevys. What did you expect, I ask you with tears in my cotton pickin' eyes? And it's not as though the brave, original Mr. Lurhmann butchered Shakespeare's text - he didn't. Sure, he edited it where he felt he needed to, and changed the ending (which I disagreed with) but every word you hear was written by the Bard himself - hence the title W.S.'s R&J.

Enough people enjoyed this movie to warrant its worthy place in the canon of Shakespeare on Film - and those (purists) that didn't should have know beforehand that it would not be their cup of tea. That's why we have the wonderful, definitive Zefferelli R&J - which this movie sure didn't attempt to compete with.

Personally, I thought this movie was a blast. That newscast opening scene (prologue) was wonderful. I rubbed my hands in imaginary glee when I saw it, because I knew I was in for a treat - and sure was. Let's not all take Shakespeare so seriously, just because he has this lofty place in our culture.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"I wouldn't say that it was the best representation of Shakespeare ever made, but at least it made 16th century English literature cool again.",6/10,cezal198,12/5/2007,"The 1996 film, Romeo + Juliet was quite over the top in many cases.

The concept is simple, a modern day Romeo and Juliet located in Verona Beach (a fictional place very similar to Miami beach), situated between two warring mob families, but the catch is that every spoken word is directly quoted from Shakespeare. Apparently, the directorial decision on how to fulfill the task of verbatim delivery in a modern setting was to make the visuals, the acting, and tempo of the film extremely eccentric. There is no other way to describe it other than: bright colors, flashing attire, ""in your face"" production design, with overly exaggerated acting in a land, where guns are swords, families are gangs, and paraphrasing is not an option.

In most cases in modern film, melodramatic acting is looked down upon, but when quoting Shakespeare, it becomes excusable. Though it seems out of place when a goon flashing a 9mm gun exchanges witty remarks with a cross dresser, it somehow fits into the style of this movie. That is why I think it was a good decision to make the film so over the top. The lines of Shakespeare coming out of anyone's mouth just adds to the overall pageantry of the film. The actor's delivery could have been better, but it is very difficult to act modern, hip, and cool, and at the same time deliver archaic lines of Shakespeare, especially when they are some of the most quoted and overused lines in history. One thing that I felt was very well done, which I think was intended, was making Shakespearian writing very understandable to their target audience whom I assume are not scholars of English literature. The visuals and the overemphatic acting are so self-proclamatory that you could probably watch the movie in a different language and still easily understand what was going on. Almost everything spoken is shown, and if its not then you just have to be smart enough to catch it.

One thing about the film that is very hard not to notice is the use of religious icons and imagery littered throughout the film. When I say littered, I mean literally littered: postcards of Mary scattered along the streets and different forms of shrines of Mary and crosses exalted in every household and even police stations. There is such an excess of pious imagery in every situation that it's almost iconoclastic. Romeo and Juliet consecrate their marriage in front of a shrine of the Virgin. Neon blue lighted crosses line the pathway to Juliet's tomb. Statuettes of Mary are seen in the same shots as the cross-dressing Mercutio (did I mention he's a cross dresser in this movie?) parties at the Capulet house. It seems very odd and discomforting to visually mix sexuality and religious icons. I am not sure if the director was just doing this to be cool, or he was making some kind of statement dealing with religion and love. It seemed slightly emphasized when Juliet calls Romeo her God whom she worships. I wonder if the interpretation of Shakespeare was taken to an extreme regarding the love and passion of two human beings. Does it override religion in this film? In the play, Shakespeare obviously followed along with the standard of marriage before sex, and the film also respected that moral statute, but sex in front of the Virgin? What are they trying to say? One can only guess.

Romeo + Juliet was a unique and enjoyable experience, and that is about it. I felt like the challenge of the film, being the use of literal Shakespeare, was so pronounced and sought after, that it didn't get much past that. It was an interesting experiment and a bold move from a filmmaker's standpoint. They accomplished what they wanted to achieve, and I applaud them for it. I wouldn't say that it was the best representation of Shakespeare ever made, but at least it made 16th century English literature cool again.",pos
RomeoJuliet,At Least It's Better Than the Original,4/10,moviewizguy,3/5/2007,"Shakespeare's famous play is updated to the hip modern suburb of Verona still retaining its original dialog. The gun-toting members of the families wage a vicious war on the streets as the star-crossed lovers, their tragic destiny.

When I saw the first 10 minutes of the film, I thought it would be one of the worst movies ever made! It even made the original look like a masterpiece! But when I continue watching it, it actually gets better and better, but not by a whole lot.

First, I probably like this film because of the modern update. I didn't like the play that Shakespeare wrote but this one actually manages the descents for me to recommend it. This film is loud, exaggerated, and bombastic! At first, those were meant to be bad things in the movie but as it progresses, I liked it.

The acting in the film is much better in this film than the original (by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes). I also liked the bizarre set pieces and songs throughout the film. It gives itself a hint of originality to it. I even thought the ending was much better.

I'm not a fan of the play. Maybe you don't have to listen to my review. I liked this version somewhat better than the original because of its fresh feel. It's not a masterpiece but it's decent enough for a rent.",neg
RomeoJuliet,It grows on you,9/10,JenWar74,19/4/2007,"I'll admit that I avoided seeing this movie in the theater because it was modernized. When the movie appeared on the premium movie channels, I watched the first 10 minutes and switched channels, turned off by the guns and the ""too modern"" aspects of the film.

Then, the next time I saw it on the movie channels, I'd watch a little bit more. Pretty soon I had watched the whole thing, and I came to appreciate it the ways the director had attempted to stay true to Shakespeare while making it more accessible to today's generation.

Leonardo seems like an okay choice, although he brings a wimp factor to Romeo's character. Then again, wasn't Romeo kind of a whipped puppy? Although I appreciate the adherence to the original language, sometimes having Romeo speak it with little or no emotion (or what seemed like the way a high school actor would read the lines) lessened the efficacy of the scene. Claire Danes is quite gifted, in my opinion, and I think she played the part well. When she pulls a gun on Friar Laurence and screams, ""Be not long to speak -- I long to die!"", we can feel her anguish. Sometimes she, like Leonardo, would read her lines with little or no emotion, and it cheapened the scene. THen again, this may have been the inevitable of effect of trying to read Shakespeare's lines in a n ""everyday"" situation. There's no crying, no anger, no anything ... therefore, how would you read the lines? Mercutio was brilliantly cast, for this actor seems to reveal the outlandish nature of the Mercutio's character.

I like the small details that the director put in there to refer to the original script or to show the division between the two families. The two buildings named after the families, the difference in dress and appearance, and the billboards around town -- the film is full of subtle (and not-so-subtle) allusions. I loved how they named the guns as to stay true to the original text.

The director heightened the death scene by having Juliet wake up and touch Romeo's cheek just after he downed the poison, rather than waking up seconds after he died. Same scene, just a minor time difference here.

The only thing I greatly disliked about the movie was how the party was turned into drug-fueled chaos. Was that necessary? Couldn't there have been a huge party without Juliet's mom sucking face with every available male, and Romeo acting loopy from whatever pill Mercutio had given him earlier? I show this movie to my high school students to provide a modernized view of the play. I can say that my students seem to ""get"" this version. The 1968 version? Not so much.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Fabulous!,10/10,arens54321,17/3/2007,"If ever there was a more brilliant and fun director than Baz Luhrmann, then please point him out. This movie is hilarious (Mercutio in drag), beautiful (love at first sight), intelligent (Wherefore, L'amour? sign), and heartbreaking (death scene). I saw this movie after I had become a Bard nut, and i thought it to be the most wonderful thing I had ever dreamed of being done with his words. The acting is not to be faulted, and while some complain that the leads did not know the meaning of their lines, I thought the performances by DiCaprio and Danes to be fresh and exciting, and especially well thought out. Watch out for Mercutio and Tybalt, they are the best performances I have ever seen of those characters. This movie is by far superior in my eyes to the 1968 version, in which all performances, save Michaael York, made me want to chop my head off with a blunt ax. All in all, eye popping cinematography included, I love it. Bravo to everyone involved.

RomeoJuliet,An excellent take on William Shakespeare,9/10,jamesolo0,28/1/2007,"Okay, I will ammit, the first time I saw this film I hated it, I thought it was the worst thing ever created.That\at was up until a few years ago, when in my English class, my teacher decided to show us this production of Shakespeare romeo and Juliet.The first few scence suck, but really getting into the party and getting to now the actors take on the characters, the film begins to make sense.Claire Daines performance in this film is amazing, you can actually feel the love and hatred she has fpr romeo, but it still it speaks to you a little more than the classic romeo and Juliet movie.Lenardo's take on Romeo's pretty solid to, he's an excellent actor and maybe thats why he's been nominated for so many Oscars. The film is fast past, and it hooks you in.If you are the type of person that doesn't get Shakespeare, this is the best film to began to understand it.I highly recommend this film.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Truly great movie,10/10,keyguy13,26/1/2007,"This is a terrific adaptation of the classic love story. I love the that the director was willing to face the wrath of all the people that take themselves too seriously to 'go wild' and really make something unusual and unique. This was an *adaptation*. It was meant to be different than the original. It has been modernized. I can't think of a better way to modernize this classic and at the same time keep it's Elizabethan heritage intact. The symbolism was meant to be a little satirical, but I don't think most people got the jokes. All in all, the acting was superb and the cinematography was phenomenal. I recommend this movie highly.

RomeoJuliet,Didn't quite win me over,4/10,C_Hardie,25/1/2007,"During the first half of this movie I was MAD. I seriously thought it was a joke at first- the whole fight scene in the beginning was weird. I couldn't accept all these thugs with guns spouting Shakespeare; I didn't find it believable at all. They took a line, ""thy drugs are quick"" completely out of context, and used it when Romeo gets high at the Capulet's party, which made me really angry. I didn't like what was done with the characters of Benvolio and Mercutio, and Claire Danes didn't always sell her role of Juliet very convincingly. The whole balcony scene where they're jumping into a pool in her backyard was kind of strange.

It did have some nice moments, though. The scene where Romeo and Juliet meet was very cute, and the wedding scene was sweet as well. After Act 3, where Romeo kills Tybalt, it got better. The fall out after the murder was fast-paced and interesting. I was really impressed with the last scenes in the church; they were breathtaking and beautifully shot.

Even though it redeemed itself in the end, most of it still didn't sit right with me. Too much of it felt like it didn't just fit. Maybe it was that it tried too hard to fit into the 90's atmosphere, or maybe Shakespeare just can't be modernized. Overall, I preferred the classic Romeo and Juliet to this interpretation.",neg
RomeoJuliet,A plague on anyone who doesn't like this movie!,9/10,dj-lord,21/12/2006,"I admit that I thought this would be rubbish when I first heard about it (not a fan of DiCaprio at all) but...

This is a great movie (one of my favourite movies) and I think the way they have kept the dialogue but updated the surroundings etc works extremely well indeed. Whereas the likes of O and 10 Things I Hate About You are updated in both style/look and dialogue, the fact is this made them seem less relevant and watered-down.

Keeping the dialogue in Romeo + Juliet means that you focus on what is said AND THE EXPRESSIONS and keeps the story powerful whilst updating the setting to modern-day Verona Beach (gangs, guns and narcotic-induced partying) make it feel real. An excellent movie with one of the best intros I've ever seen (nice little news cast and introduction of the gang fighting/rivalry).

(Pity about Moulin Rouge though!!!) If you haven't seen Romeo + Juliet - WATCH IT!",pos
RomeoJuliet,William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,7/10,jboothmillard,11/12/2006,"I first saw bits of this and dismissed it because back then I hated Leonardo DiCaprio and Shakespearean language in the modern world, but now I like both. BAFTA winning director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) has brought the famous William Shakespeare love story into the 20th century (not the language of course), e.g. daggers are guns called Dagger. Romeo (DiCaprio) and Juliet (Terminator 3's Claire Danes) are two strong lovers, but they cannot be together as their families are in a battle with each other. The story is no change from the original play story, and in fact, it is almost like a stage performance (particularly with characters not ""looking behind them""). A lovely and tragic film with a doomed romance. Also starring John Leguizamo as Tybalt, Lost's Harold Perrineau as Mercutio, Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague, Friends' Paul Rudd as Dave Paris, Miriam Margolyes as The Nurse and Des'ree is in the film singing the film's love song, ""Kissing You"". It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, it won the BAFTAs for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Nellee Hooper, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound. Very good!",pos
RomeoJuliet,Funnier then hell,10/10,dhlinca1,6/12/2006,"A little while ago, I saw this film during a class where we previously read the play. The play was satisfactory, meaning I understood it and did not hate it. After reading the play, we saw the movie. I loved it. I could not stop laughing. It was just so corny beyond belief. Parts that were not supposed to be humorous, were. For example, the first scene in the gas station was absolutely hilarious with them jumping around shooting.

I thought that the old English applied to the modern stuff was not realistic or necessary, but I thought it was funnier then hell. It was hilarious how they all spoke in such ridiculous wordings as they preformed these actions.

For those who hated this film, I just have to say that you cannot take these things really seriously. The play is outdated now, and will be in the future. Back then, it was great! In addition, they cannot change the words, because then it wouldn't be true to the play. So, just take this with a grain of salt.

I loved when Romeo killed Tybalt. That was so corny and ridiculous I fell on the floor laughing. When the rain cloud burst over head, when he rammed his car into Tybalt's car, it was so hilarious.

I have nothing but good memories about this film.

WARNING: If you expect a scene for scene regurgitation, then this is not for you. I seriously recommend reading this play before hand, unless it will be so confusing. Oh, and I hated the original film. I couldn't understand it and fell asleep after the first part with the prince.",pos
RomeoJuliet,visually captivating...........but,8/10,Tarna85,29/11/2006,"I can't help but love this film. Maybe because i'm a huge luhrmann fan, i love hes red curtain movies and the distinctive and lavish cinematography of them.

The only negative aspect to me in this adaption of the worlds most famous love story was the casting of claire danes and leo DiCaprio. They were good but not brilliant. Shakespeare is about the language and there's no point in portraying a Shakespeare play if you do not deliver the dialoge properly. Claire tended to rush the lines and not let her mouth open up to get it around the words. It sometimes felt like she fully didn't understand the text of what she was saying. I can really see that should would have needed strong direction as some of her gestures, they way she moved and spoke seemed forced. Physically she looked every inch like a juliet with her curious eyes and young features.

Leo i think did a better job than danes in the fact that he had a lot of passion but with his characterization, his actions spoke louder than words. The scene where we are introduced to romeo with his voice over made me cringe and because this was the first time in the film we were hearing him speak Shakespeare, it left me in a lot of doubt having to hear him in the rest of the film, not a good start. However the scene where he watches juliet dance with Paris made up for it. In some scenes he over acted in other's not enough. I personally think the love scenes should have been A lot more intense, it was to tender. Romeo and juliet is not suppose to be all prettied-up but brutal and powerful both in violence and romance.

I can now sit back and look past those glitches and take in the film because i don't think baz would have been able to find 2 other actors to portray those roles any better than leo and claire. If anything other young actors would have probably given the same performance.Leo and claire do NOT make me dislike the film in the slightest though. I was driven to near tears during the beautiful fish tank scene it was like a fantasy, the whole Capulet ball sequence was like a fantasy. The way they suddenly jumped up and began searching each other with there eyes made you really believe that it was love at first site. That has got to be one of the most stunning pieces on film. Of course the death scene. I liked they they twisted it a bit so that instead of juliet waking to find romeo dead she watches him and looks into his eyes alive for the last time before reuniting in death. For those teenagers that were saying 'why didn't she say something to stop him from killing himself' it's this simple..............you can't re-write history. We all know how it ends but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat while watching it unfold.

I could go on and on about the film in a lot of ways but at the end of the day, it's entertaining and beautiful and tragic, and thats what romeo and juliet, the story is about. Baz has not let anyone down, he has not killed the play, he ha re-invented it for today's generation.",pos
RomeoJuliet,I love this movie,10/10,bunnihunni14,30/10/2006,"Wow I love this movie because first off Leo plays a really sexy Romeo but also because this movie is really great. The way they mixed up Shakespeare's work is amazing. Claire Danes is a great Juliet but I wish I was Juliet so I could make out with Leo. I love this movie and you should see it too. The part where Romeo poisons himself and when Juliet kills herself is sad. It's also sad because Romeo and Juliet never got to run away and enjoy life as husband and wife, and be free from their relatives who hated each other so much. They would of lived if the relatives could just get along. I loved how they set it in modern times with Shakespeare's work so he could get credit. This movie is a total twist of the original. That's why I love this movie. I LOVE LEO DICAPRIO

RomeoJuliet,Baz Luhrmann is the Master of Interpretation,9/10,gavin6942,22/10/2006,"Prior to watching ""Romeo and Juliet"", I had seen ""Moulin Rouge"" a few times and loved it. Luhrmann took an opera by Puccini (""La Boheme"") and made a great tale of it, with music and visuals that will blow your mind. (""Rent"" is also based on ""La Boheme"", but is trite and caters to an audience I am not a part of.) My expectations for ""Romeo and Juliet"" were fairly high, given my admiration of Luhrmann.

As you can guess by my 9 out of 10 rating, I was not disappointed. Luhrmann took the classic Shakespeare and super-imposed it over modern day Verona Beach. Like ""Moulin Rouge"" where he took modern rock songs and placed them in 1900 France, here he takes the language of Shakespeare and places it in the contemporary. Rather than simply changing the dialog to modern usage, he gave the text its due.

This works incredibly well, and makes the film so much better than regular language would. The story seems richer, more epic and most importantly timeless. And the story is the story of love, which is just that: rich, epic and timeless.

And the visuals were stunning! The colors set a mood (such as the darkness after Mercutio's death) and there was such vibrancy in the clothing. The water theme resonated well, with great effects of seeing a lover for the first time through a fish tank, the rain falling at key moments, and the film focusing on both a beach and near a swimming pool.

Luhrmann knows how to direct John Leguizamo, and I would say this is one of his two best roles (the other being ""Moulin Rouge""). Harold Perrineau (Mercutio) shows great range, much more so than in other roles he's had since (""The Matrix"" or TV's ""Lost""). And this is probably the most un-funny Jamie Kennedy you'll ever see, which I mean in the most positive way.

Claire Danes is a delightful Juliet, giving a memorable performance (easily the peak of her career). She is physically perfect for the role, young and beautiful without being overly vulnerable or sexed-up. The only other actress I can picture capable of this kind of role is Julia Stiles, but I can't see her being as much of a fit and she would likely over-act... her Shakespeare style and Luhrmann's are not in synchronicity.

The role of Romeo, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was perfect. Nobody could have been better. This isn't the young Leo from before or the rough and rugged Leo that appears in films later on. This is the Leo on the verge of adulthood, but still remaining tender enough to have the youthful idealism of a Romeo. As my co-viewer phrased it, he's a ""babe"" (in more ways than she meant). I know of no other actor who has the acting abilities of Leo, at least not in his age range. He has a long career ahead of him if he can keep up the intensity he has here (as well as in ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York""... though not as much in ""The Beach"").

A slight note on the music: As much as I love the Cardigans, I almost think ""Lovefool"" was a poor choice for this film... too poppy. But everything else was great: Butthole Surfers, Everclear, and especially One Inch Punch with the inspired ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". And Garbage, a vastly under-appreciated band, with one of their better tunes, ""#1 Crush"". A great album for a great film.

If you haven't seen this film, your life is not complete. I went eleven years avoiding Romeo and Juliet, but having now broken my vow, I am glad I did. This film doesn't just impress, it inspires.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Hip and intense modernization,8/10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,21/10/2006,"I hadn't heard all of this story before watching this film, so please forgive me any misunderstandings that may come as a result of that ignorance. When I heard that this was done by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, who later went on to create Moulin Rouge together, which is one of my favorite love stories(granted, at the time I first saw it, that was a pretty short list) of all time, as well as just about the only true musical that I've found myself enjoying, naturally I was going to watch it. Plus, it's difficult to challenge the quality of William Shakespeare's writings, and this is said to be one of his best works. The idea is magnificent; take the original story and retell it in modern day suburbia, with the original dialog(though, obviously, unfortunately, not all the dialog could be retained; I was disappointed to find that the brief exchange regarding ""how deep was the cut"" was not in the film). The result works out very well, by changing the setting to one that today's youth can easier relate to, whilst still making the points that the original play did. The plot is very good, and evolves nicely throughout. The pace is *intense*. This thing moves non-stop. Blink and you'll miss something. At times, this speed was almost overwhelming. The running time is two (exactly!) hours, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost all of it. The editing seems to bear traces of this... more often than not, it seems like the scene or certain cuts of it had been trimmed by a few seconds, to ensure the run-time length, and it can be a little confusing(for the quite few times it happens). I will say that Luhrmann kept the pace at an appropriate rate for the dramatic scenes. In fact, they may become even stronger, from the otherwise extreme pace. The line-delivery is fast, but exceptional. The acting is excellent. I can't name a single performance that I found even slightly flawed. The casting is marvelous, as well... the two leads and the supporting players are spot-on(heck, even Jamie Kennedy worked, here). The music is a good mix of hip, new music and a beautiful score. Production values are high. The cinematography causes a confusing moment or two, but it mostly simply serves to keep the intensity up. A well-done modernization of the famous play. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it, and/or William Shakespeare. Do keep in mind that there are various creative decisions made, changing the original tale... including one regarding the famous ending. 8/10",pos
RomeoJuliet,A surprisingly original idea,8/10,phenomynouss,4/10/2006,"In my personal opinion, I believe Shakespeare's writing is way too obscure and out there, and think those people who say ""Shakespeare wrote for the common people"" and such are either blatantly lying to us schoolchildren, or I can only cringe in terror at what plays written for educated people must have sounded like.

This movie doesn't change the dialect or dialog of the movie, and gives it a weird sort of artistic modern setting, which makes it not only a surprising and original twist, but makes it much more watchable to see a timeless tale truly tested with its claim to timelessness. Even if it took place in the year 3010 AD, it'd still be the same.

I love the way the adults on the newscasts and police speak, and the way the police officer at the end of the movie scolds the Capulets and Montagues, and the beginning scene, with the Montague nerds biting their thumbs at the Capulets was amusing.

The guy who plays Mercutio (I think he also plays Link in the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) is spellbinding, and John Leguizamo is equally spectacular in this movie.

What keeps this movie from a 9 or a 10 in my opinion is the two lead characters played abysmally by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. DiCaprio, normally a great actor, sounds like he's just memorized the lines and is reciting them like a schoolchild forced to read them aloud in class--lifeless, with little to no emotion, and an apparent lack of understanding as to what he is saying.

Claire Danes is even worse, delivering lines in such an awkward manner as to make me cringe. It sounds literally like a giggly, bubbly school girl reading from a script for the first time while distracted by something else.

Another thing which surprisingly irritated me was the SCREAMING. In many scenes, there was mindless screaming at the hands of Juliet's mother and maid, especially that scene where Romeo is at Juliet's window, and the maid calls for her, and Danes (awkwardly) says ""By and by I come"", the maid's line is literally *takes deep breath*:

JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!

for at the very least, 5-10 seconds long

There's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other. But it is SERIOUSLY annoying having her scream like that when Juliet is CLEARLY shouting back ""By and by I come""",pos
RomeoJuliet,my favorite movie,10/10,hairy_butt_harry,3/10/2006,"this movie is so beautiful. I first watched it when I was 10 years old, and I was so moved, I cried. I am now older and because I understand it more,I find it even better. It is truly a masterpiece, just like Baz's other wonders in the series.Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are some of the best actors in my opinion, and at such young ages (Leo was 21, Claire was 17, AS FAR AS I KNOW!) it's terrific. They did such a wonderful job, and still to this day I believe they made such an in love couple. I consider them one of the best on screen couples I have ever seen in any movie, in my life.They belong together. I still feel so much love for them every time I see this film, and every time wish and wish they had not died in such a way!But I always cheer myself up by thinking ""at least it was together, like they belonged""...",pos
RomeoJuliet,Visually fantastic but confused version.,7/10,m-elizabeth-c,12/9/2006,"Baz Lurhman's Romeo + Juliet has both good and bad. the visuals and modernised Verona are spectacular and sumptuous, while DeCaprio and Danes leave some to be desired. The supporting cast is strong and holds together this crazy film though quality Shakespearean acting and a sense of fun that is severely lacking in most Shakespeare films. I personally have a problem with the main portrayals because neither is particularly adept at playing Shakespeare modernly and convincingly. the portrayals of Tybalt, Mercutio, Friar Lawrence and the Prince stand out and are excellent modern interpretations. the use of gun can seem forced at times but is understandable and fits with the visual style. The film is chaotic and is not for everyone ( several of my roommates absolutely despise it) but it can be a refreshing look at Shakespeare. Ultimately, individual taste plays heavily into opinion; while it is definitely worth seeing you may decide never to watch it again after.

RomeoJuliet,Wow! Really! Give this one a chance!!,9/10,northwestvp,9/9/2006,"I'm sick of all these self-absorbed people ""commenting"" on movies they wouldn't have the gal, guts, brains or balls to make. Among these comments, I've seen this movie called ""contrived"", ""self-important"" and ""forgettable"". These people don't know much.

Why is it that people can't watch a movie and appreciate it for what the writer, director and crew were trying to portray? Even if it may have fell short? (Which this movie DID NOT!) Baz has an amazing visual eye and a real knack for finding music that rips us down to the core. I personally believe one of the most beautiful and moving scenes in this entire film is when Romeo and Juliet first meet each other with fleeting glances through the aquarium glass, to that AMAZING song, ""Kissing You"" by Des'ree.

And to everyone that said it wasn't original seeing guys with dyed hair and unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts running around reciting Shakespeare, well... I'm sad for you.

I don't have much to say for this movie, because when this movie really shines, I can't come up with words, it just makes me FEEL. I'm sorry for the people who can sit through this movie and not feel a thing because they're too busy thinking of reasons to hate it.

RomeoJuliet,Nice try,6/10,DutchECK,2/8/2006,"It's a nice idea: putting the original text of Romeo and Juliet into a modern, urbanised, setting. It will appeal to a much younger audience (making it instantly suitable for classroom use) and it will show the world that what Shakespeare wrote is still applicable to modern day. Unfortunately, it did not work out the way it should have. One of the fatal flaws was that the text was not followed as closely as I would have liked it. In fact, things were added that were hideously out of place and two important parts that should have been included have been omitted. However, it is virtually impossible to create an exciting film without playing with the text a little, so the writers have been forgiven as far as I'm concerned.

The one thing that I really cannot let pass is the combination the setting makes with the text. Keeping the original text with a modern setting has been done successfully in the past. The director here chose to make the setting and its characters over the top. The way the young Montagues and the young Capulets are portrayed may be clear, but it is also annoying to see that the Montagues are shown as surfer/stoners and the Capulets as Latino gangsters. This, combined with the setting, decors and acting makes for a film that is extremely over the top. This simply does not work with a text that is subtle, where most of the humour and entertainment is to be had from small quips and remarks, not from broad-sweeping statements and grandeur. Especially the love between Romeo and Juliet should be quiet, not playful as it is in this film.

Of course there are some good things about this film. In keeping with Shakespeare's love of subtle word jokes, this film has quite a few. There are several 'hidden' hints to other Shakespearean plays. Also, I liked the newscaster as opening chorus. This gave the film an air of modernity while still keeping the goal of the prologue, which is introducing the play. These things made for a two hours that were not completely awful.

I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare, although I do like it when people take freedoms with the text or the setting. However, Romeo + Juliet strayed too far from the nest.",neg
RomeoJuliet,Greatest film ever,10/10,ILoveJG,14/6/2006,"This is a fantastic film. It really told the story of Romeo and Juliet well. The actors were well picked and their acting was superb. A tragic story told well in a modern version. The way they adapt to modern life is brilliant. But, get the tissues, a very sad film. All fight scenes are well directed and all 'love' scenes are well written. It's quite different to any plays you would have seen, characters have different relationships.

If you have not seen this movie GO SEE IT! It is my no.1 film of all time! Best film I've seen with both Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in. The roles are played perfectly.

RomeoJuliet,More Comedy Than Tragedie.,6/10,dunmore_ego,13/6/2006,"All I'm saying is: Leonardo DiCaprio should stop being prettier than his female co-stars. In *Romeo and Juliet*, snub-nosed Claire Danes bravely steps up to out-femme Leo's manly prettiness. And fails.

Leonardo is Romeo (kinda archly poetic, no?) and Claire is his Juliet. Shakespeare's retelling of Ovid's *Pyramus and Thisbe* is retold with creative conceptualizing and high-voltage visuals by Australian thunderboy, director Baz Luhrmann, as an urban gang battle with a decidedly MTV-ian thrust.

Alas, Luhrmann's noble idealism in re-inventing the Bard's most famous play for a generation weaned on music videos and boy bands unfortunately falls on ears deaf to irony, sarcasm, double entendre, punning, words larger than six letters and intelligence. Which pretty much rules out Shakespeare's *oeuvre*.

Throwing out major portions of text (""Text? What's that?"" mumbles Generation X), yet elocuting the remainder verbatim, performances are unevenly astounding, for when the actors can stop shouting at each other in the manner of Entertainment Tonight hosts declaring showbiz headlines, their occasional fluidity creates pockets of crystal clarity that move with the rhythms Shakespeare intended. Alas, it is unsustainable for most of them.

Thrown into this mix of varying talents, Dash Mihok, Jamie Kennedy (it was all I could do to stop imagining them prefacing everything with ""Yo yo yo"") and DiCaprio stand out like ailing speechaphobics against the menacing fluidity of John Leguizamo, the simple sincerity of Claire Danes and the authoritative Shakespearean veteran, Pete Postlethwaite (still pushing 55, as he was 20 years ago).

As Mercutio, cross-dressing Harold Perrineau steals the show in his mini-skirt, bra and command of Shakespearean rhythm. And look at those legs!

The precursor to all Chick Flicks, you know the old story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl drinks poison, boy kills himself, girl wakes up, girl kills herself. Ain't love grand?",pos
RomeoJuliet,This movie is something to be appreciated.,10/10,adri278,12/6/2006,"This best word I can think of to describe this movie is vibrant. The bright colors, vivid scenery and outlandish characterization are trademarks of Luhrmann's style, and I for one think that it is cinematography at its best. He brings us into the world of Shakespeare in a way no one else has. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 11 and it prompted me to buy the play and ever since then I have been in love with it. I appreciate Baz's attempt at aiming the story to a younger audience. You don't find many kids these days (or ten years ago...has it really been that long??) who want to willingly read Shakespeare. The language is complicated and unfamiliar. But the stories are worth knowing, and I think this movie is a step forward in familiarizing Shakespeare to the modern times.

There are plenty of people who disagree with the use to Shakespeare's dialogue in the modern setting. I have argued this point over and over and this is what I have to say to them: It seems that someone who appreciates Shakespeare would want his brilliant words to be used. You see the movie and you think: Baz Luhrmann, you hear the dialogue and you think: William Shakespeare. If you are someone who can't understand Shakespeare, the makers of the film dedicated themselves to finding ways, by using imagery, to decode the language and make it more understandable.

I've often heard complaints about the acting in this movie as well. I for one don't see anything wrong with the acting, and I thought the cast did very well with the difficult dialogue. I've always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio. Back when I first saw this movie, it was just because I thought he was cute. But now, I see an actor who plays his roles with intensity and passion. He is the perfect Romeo to me. He portrays the passionate, lovesick lead incredibly well. We see his heart break on the screen when Mercutio is slain, and again when he learns of Juliet's ""death."" We see his all-consuming rage when he is chasing after Tybalt to avenge his friend's death. We see a boy falling in love with a girl and wanting to be with her for the rest of his life. He goes though all of these emotions seamlessly, and in the end, you really don't want this guy to die.

Claire Danes as Juliet impressed me as well. She has a much less flashy role than Leo, but she brings strong character to the innocent, angelic young woman. My favorite parts with her were when she was alone, speaking to herself. I really thought she did the dialogue very well, and she is often who I think of when I read the play. She handles the emotional stuff with experience, and you are left there wishing you could do something for this girl who goes through so much in such a short time.

My favorite character in the movie has to be Meructio, played by Harold Perrineau. He's loud, flamboyant, and I can't get enough of him when he is on the screen. He even dresses in drag at the costume party where Romeo and Juliet meet, and lip-syncs to ""Young Hearts Run Free."" He plays the loyal friend with feeling, and it is very disappointing when he meets his end.

This movie definitely isn't for everyone. Some people just can't quite grasp what Luhrmann was trying to accomplish with this movie. He wasn't trying to do a replica of the play or the movies made before it. It's different. It's daring. Some parts might just make you laugh out loud. But the tragedy of the story is still very much there.

In my opinion, this movie is something to be appreciated. It steps out of the norm and pulls you into a world of love and tragedy with its intense delivery and unique portrayal of a timeless story.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Great Movie!,10/10,SamoaGurl,20/5/2006,"My English class just finished a unit on Romeo and Juliet and we finished it out with the viewing of this movie. Originally I was very interested to see this movie and I was hoping that i wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio have such chemistry in this film, it is amazing! This movie literally take your normal, everyday, Romeo and Juliet and adapts it into a more realistic time-line and setting, This movie also does an amazing job of representing the many emotional concepts covered in the actual play. Even though the dialog in this movie is said in the Shakespearian- English format, It is very easy to understand if one has read the play before. So, all in all, great movie!

RomeoJuliet,So what IS in a name?,7/10,lee_eisenberg,16/5/2006,"Hark! But what film from yonder director breaks? Starring the young man who hath since played Howard Hughes It is east, and Juliet is Claire Danes Wherefore art thou, modern language? (no offense to purists, but Shakespearean talk in the modern world is starting to get old, so I'll cease it).

""Romeo + Juliet"" is overall acceptable, and I really liked the first run-in between the Montagues and Capulets. I think that it would be sort of neat to see a space-age version of this story. On second thought, Shakespearean talk and the Jetsons' world wouldn't really mix. But the point is that they did a pretty good job here. It's sort of irking to think that this probably paved the way for Leonardo DiCaprio's role in ""Titanic"".

Also starring John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, Brian Dennehy, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Miriam Margoyles, Jamie Kennedy and M. Emmet Walsh.

RomeoJuliet,A few interesting bits,8/10,jadehottie,4/5/2006,"Though I did not get to see the ending, this reincarnation of Romeo & Juliet rings truer to the original than I thought it would. Several lines are ""copied and pasted"" to other parts of the film: in the beginning before the Capulet's party, for instance, Romeo takes a pill from Mercutio that resembles Ecstasy. The line, ""The drugs are quick,"" taken from Act 5, completes the image nicely along with hazy, quick-cut scenes from the party. The added clumsiness of Romeo was a sweet touch to the character that Leo D.Caprio conveyed rather well: the man cannot stop falling into the pool during the balcony scene. He also crashes into a candle stand in the church while he's begging Father Laurence to perform his and Juliet's marriage ceremony. Fell on his face... I laughed. Claire Danes was a bit much for me, I must admit... when she screams at Lord Capulet's character it hurt my ears. ""Proud can I never be of what I HATE,"" Ow.... ow... but overall it was a good film. You'd be surprised how sorry you get for Tybalt when J.L. plays him... eh. Peace Out.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Come on now, make some dialogue that's worth understanding",5/10,OriginalMovieBuff21,30/4/2006,"Romeo and Juliet is based on Shakespeare's famous tragedy about two lovers torn between their two families vicious hatred towards each other based in present day Verona. The movie was pretty boring to me actually. I'm glad the movie followed the play really well, but still it was annoying hearing the dialogue that was used 400 years ago. If you wanted to make a better film, you could've made it like the film ""O"" based on Othello. O didn't have that dialogue and it still was quite an enjoyable film. Overall, Leonardo's great looks and the big cast didn't make this an entertaining film and that goes along with the dialogue too!

RomeoJuliet,Most gripping Shakespeare,10/10,ben-and-jerrys,22/4/2006,"I was really surprised how good this film was, when i first saw it i found myself getting bored. However when i saw it the second time i was gripped. Even though it used Shakespearean language i found that i could follow the dialogue. Leonardo Dicaprio was fantastic in this film, a very believable character and i found the violence, as brutal as it was, very necessary. I was also really happy that Juliets character wasn't as melodramatic as she always seems to be and also less innocent. As weird as it is i find the opening scene, after the reporter on the t.v, one of my favourite scenes. The way it is presented is astounding, the music, the text and the speech it great. The way they incorporated the story into a modern setting is so clever and even though they use the Shakespearean language i didn't find it out of place. Overall i found this film truly remarkable and a certain classic.

RomeoJuliet,Rome's and Jule's,8/10,jason_hille,16/4/2006,"Luhrmann is without a doubt a genius of a man. One of the most tricky things in bring relics into our current reality is keeping it as authentic as the first day it rolled out onto stage. Shakespeare is no easy man to copy and even more difficult to imitate.

DiCaprio wasn't the best choice for Romeo as far as the dialog and acting bits are concerned. Don't get me wrong, he's a great actor, but lacks the ability to play tough when the time comes for it. From what I understand, Romeo was a decent swordsman as the play recalls. However, little action came from the guns portrayed as the weapon of choice to match the time period.

Harold Perrineau, who played Mercutio, had a crucial role in this film as the best friend of the dear Romeo and more than anything else, protector of Romeo's dreams. It was an outstanding performance because I truly believed that Mr. Perrineau new the emotions and dialog well enough to portray them realistically.

Claire Danes is just an outstanding actress with beauty all around and a more honest approach to the Juliet in this film. It's not easy playing a love interest, but in this movie, it's clear that both DiCaprio and Danes played love interest to each other instead of one or the other.

John Leguizamo is an accomplished comedian, so portraying the ever serious and straight forward Tybalt just didn't seem the role for him. I think that Leguizamo is trying to approach all angles of his acting career which takes much talent, but once you're a comedian that stands out, it's difficult to get out of that genre.

I'd have given this movie better than an 8 if not for the fact that it was relatively uneventful. It's a Tragic Love Story. You can't really expect much more.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare for toady,9/10,hiroyukiwu,28/2/2006,"I would say that this film is made for the MTV generation except for the fact that any generation can easily sit through a couple of hours to watch this triumphant film. The story is old and well known to most. The actors seem like hotties with experienced actors, and on paper this would have been hard to argue against, but solid acting all around with great innovation (guns for swords, set in modern day) it holds up well and creates reputations for actors otherwise considered 'eye candy'. Two people come off very well in my opinion, Leonardo Dicaprio (as Romeo) and John Leguizamo (as Tybalt). With Leo playing the part of someone who thinks he's is in love to actually falling in love and Leguizamo as the relative with hatred and anger which is channeled greatly towards his foe. Well thought through and some times cool, Baz Luhrmann (director) pulls out all the stops and defies expectation, truly spectacular!

RomeoJuliet,This movie is really interesting,10/10,geni12591,28/2/2006,"My English class was discussing this movie after having read the play. I love the movie because of the way Baz Lurhman uses modern imagery and contrasts it with the original lines of the play. Though he does use modern imagery like guns, if you look at the guns it says ""9 mm Sword..."" (Lurhman). I found that very ironic and humorous. There was one thing in the movie I didn't like and that was that Baz Lurhman made Mercutio Gay and totally threw off the actual basis of the play. Shakespeare makes it evident in the play that there is something ""more"" between Romeo and Mercutio but I think Lurhman emphasized it just a little to much. Another idea of the movie that I find intriguing about the movie is how at the beginning Lurhman switches the lines of the Capulets and the Montagues. This I believe that Lurhman was trying to manipulate the lines of Act1:Sc1 to direct the audiences into his interpretation of the families. As I said before the movie was awesome, To Lurhman "" try to do another of Shakespeare's play the way you did Romeo and Juliet I would go and see it."" If another one is made like this I go and see it (last few words directed towards Baz Lurhman).

RomeoJuliet,"Loved it, but why Claire Danes?",10/10,aleen_o-1,23/2/2006,"After reading the first page of the IMDb readers' ""Comments"" filtered in order of ""Best"" Comments, I found myself agreeing with most, and even learning historical tidbits and artistic insights to enhance future viewings. Since other readers said it so well, I have only one question: With all the potential actresses who could have played Juliet, why Claire Danes?

Though appropriately young and innocent contrasting against the debauched culture backdrop, throughout the entire movie her northern homeliness seemed improbable to have diverted Romeo's romantic spark from Rosline, ab alluring siren by his friend Mercutio's description, guaranteed to keep an impressionable and romantic young man ensnared.

Claire's hair poorly dyed at the roots in a color conflicting with her natural pallor and lacking life and shine was fine for her death scene, but not captivating prior. (Picture Greek actress Jennifer Anniston's shining, moving tresses mutely but eloquently attesting to a pampered upbringing and great south-of-the-equator genetic heritage.) Likewise Claire's pasty skin tone and lack of feature definition requiring makeup she was denied except way too late some too-dark and earthbound brick lipstick clashing not only with her coloring but her angelic costume for the big party.

Italian girls' beauty is in curving black eyebrows arching like flying swallows above thickly fringed lashes lowering modestly over shy but alluringly smoldering dark eyes while thick glossy ringlets toss and curve around plump skin warmed by cloudless sunny Mediterranean skies. (Think Latin lovers and salsa dancers.) Does this describe Claire Danes? Not at all!

Instead we're served up a pasty pale girl from north of the Equator who looks like the Dane she is named from chilly overcast Denmark, with crudely common peasant features. My neighbors are prettier than this flat-chested, dull-colored, severely-in-need-of-makeup girl who should be cast as a Puritan maid to a rich scion of the estate who falls in love with her because prolonged proximity teaches him maturely to appreciate her grateful sweetness and trustworthy salt-of-the earth soul. A far cry from the instantly captivating, imagination-firing, arrestingly demure but hotly passionate Capulet little rich girl.

Claire's best visual trait is easily and quickly identified since she was gifted with so little aesthetically; but she wastes that lively smile prematurely in her scenes so that it feels coyly contrived, like a cute little masked clown instead of the ingenuously spontaneous eruption out of a girlish soul trembling on the threshold of new womanly feelings...shakily unfamiliar but at the same time deliciously tempting to be explored with this suddenly appearing object for her adoration--intense, beautiful, and ardorous young Romeo.

I longed for a prior Juliet--innocently sultry and husky-voice Olivia Hussey, a petite little hussy of a princess--opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. Or even Marisa Tomei, who always seems young, hot-headed and vulnerable. Or even the youngest ""Gilmore Girl"" (though not typically Italian), with her big eyes, shiny hair, and lovely young body delicately yielding to new sensuality. We want a girl on her first date and prom, a Snow White awakened by her youthful Prince charming, not a tomboy.

This artistic production was such an original piece and so vividly delivered that the colorless Claire was an even bigger disappointment to me here than she would have been in a more pedestrian production of the classic Romeo & Juliet. I'm sure I'll enjoy this actress in future movies better suited, since IMDb readers' comment enthusiastically about her; but she stops me from wanting to own this otherwise artistic and moving rendition of the poetry of Romeo & Juliet.",pos
RomeoJuliet,This movie is great for the teenage girls out there who need a good movie to watch while they wallow.,8/10,trix515,11/2/2006,"This movie is great because it shows a girl who never makes her own decisions. Her father is rich and her mother sets her up with the most available bachelors she can. Her nurse drags her away from Romeo often, which reminds me of me. I'm dragged away from my crushes at school by my friends who always need me, so it's nice to see someone go through what I go through. Romeo likes his best friend, but he just needs to be by himself sometimes. I love all the religious symbols in the movie too. The Capulets like to where gang-like clothes and the Montagues more of a Hawaiin t-shirt collection. My favorite scene is the pool hall. It takes the written words from the book and puts them in a place where people can understand what Romeo is going through. I give the movie an 8 because I hate the ending. I watched this movie when my boyfriend broke up with me and it helped. If they both survived in the end, I'd give it a 10.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Best film version for Generation X, Y and Z",10/10,juubei-2,24/1/2006,"When I was in 9th grade, my English class was studying Romeo and Juliet and as luck would have it, this version was in theatres! Unfortunately, my English teacher felt the modern setting and teen dream stars were an affront to Shakespeare's classic play and while the other class got to go see it, we were stuck watching the version from the 70s in a dimly lit library on a 20"" set. She even fast-forwarded through the love scenes. Its that type of person that will likely hate this movie, and while they don't really deserve it, lets all take a moment to pity their lack of adventure and youthful exuberance that this story clearly embodies.

OK... now on to the review.

Most teenagers when they first learn about Shakespeare will likely begin with Romeo & Juliet. Its a popular and easily digestible tale. And most students will probably have a slightly difficult time with the language, but the meaning of the lines will not be lost on them with this modernized version by celebrated director Baz Luhrman. Carefully chosen images intermingle with the lines and soon you forget about the strangeness of the language and are engrossed in the story, as Shakespeare himself would've intended.

Starring in the lead roles are talented stars and character actors, even some super stars like DiCaprio, and with music courtesy of Radiohead, how can you go wrong? While the contemporary setting may turn some people off, they are missing the point.

The point is, the time and place are essentially unimportant. Young love can happen anywhere and at anytime, and often does. So what does it matter if you have guns instead of swords? Or a mardi-gras style party instead of a stuffy costumed affair? What is important is that the audience feel connected to the original material, and despite its archaic language, truly FEEL the emotions the way Shakespeare intended.

Thats what I love about this version. Even the uninitiated will lose any predisposition about the language, maybe even come to appreciate it! through a cleverly updated depiction they can more easily relate to.

I give it a 10/10 because its awesome.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Baz Luhrmann is a Genius,9/10,molly-angelica-1,1/1/2006,"Baz Luhrmann's superb version of Romeo and Juliet met and surpassed my expectations. When I heard that it would have Leonardo DiCaprio in it I imagined he wouldn't make the cut but he seems surprisingly natural when showing Romeo's emotions in Shakespearian dialogue. The fact that they cast Harold Perrineau (Michael from LOST) as a cross-dressing Mercutio would seem ridiculous but it somehow works well. However, I do feel that Tybalt needed to show more of an understanding of his words and that Romeo's parents were under-used. The pure 90's songs took me back to when I was still in primary school and made me smile as ""You and Me Always"" comes on when Romeo is coming to arrange his marriage. The ending (which I must note changed slightly as Romeo normally dies a while before Juliet wakes up) still makes me cry and want Romeo to see Juliet stirring, and Juliet's sorrow as Romeo dies in her arms is beautifully played by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. The fact that they kept in the original text and thus changed the actual swords to gun makes of 'Sword' 'Dagger' and 'Blade' was an excellent transition from Shakespeare's times. The majority of the actors seem comfortable in speaking Elizabethan English and you get a feeling of a new kind of slang to be used by gangs in the lines. All in all, one of my ""top ten movies you must see before you die"".",pos
RomeoJuliet,An excellent look at Shakespeare...,8/10,jdlewallen,30/12/2005,"If Shakespeare were alive today, he would probably be a Hollywood writer/director, and would most likely approve of this updated version! One has to remember that in his day, Shakespearean theater was not ""high society"" entertainment, but was rather looked down upon as ""vulgar"" and as the popular entertainment of the day! Director Baz Luhrmann keeps the original text of Shakespeare intact, but updates the setting to modern-day. While at first strange, the juxtaposition of modern setting and Elizabethan dialogue DO work, and give the audience (especially those of the younger generation) a truer and better appreciation and understanding of this classic play.

The same way with books-if I can predict what s going to happen it s not a good book.About this one,I obviously knew the ending but the manner in which the story was delivered-the crazy editing,the amazing image(thank God for a great director of photography!!!),the mind-blowing soundtrack...Even if it may seem a bit chaotic,the film is actually composed in a very organised and clean manner.The first rule of film composition is that everything has a meaning,otherwise it wouldn't be there.The best example is the image of the two buildings belonging to the rival families separated by a statue of Christ...This is a definite must see!",pos

RomeoJuliet,film review compared to Shakespeare's original intent of his play,8/10,twinkle1984,22/11/2005,"In the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, perversion of reason is one of the main motifs. During the Renaissance, reason was a moral concept that allied humans with God and distinguished them from the beasts. The concept implied having right love that is governed by reason and not lustful passions or the worshiping of idolatries. Shakespeare's intent of Romeo and Juliet is to show a right type of love through a love that is lustfully wrong. According to Elizabethan values, true love goes beyond surface appearances, guided by reason and clear-sightedness; more specifically, it accords with Divine law. Wrong love is excessive and idolatress, based solely on appearances. The relationship of Romeo and Juliet portrays wrong love to show that this type of love can only end in tragedy. Consequently, the film, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet attempts to mimic Shakespeare's intent; however fails to achieve the overall meaning that is expressed in the original play.

Baz Luhrmann, the director of the film keeps some element of Shakespeare's original intent in his film. The film appears to take place within three to seven days. Romeo and Juliet are both young, and the hastiness in the film parallels the hastiness in the play through Mercutio. However, these similar elements are not strong enough to argue that the film version of Romeo and Juliet is truly Shakespeare's intent. In reality the Baz Luhrmann film makes the ""lovers"" appear as if they represent right love.

The music in the film is a key part of this aspect. Love songs such as # 1 crush, Angel, Kissing You, and You and Me song surround Romeo and Juliet whenever they are together. They are uplifting tunes that trick the viewer into seeing Romeo and Juliet as the epitome of right love.

The film also has Romeo and Juliet surrounded in bright sunlight or luminous lit up rooms. Light images gives viewers the impression that Romeo and Juliet's ""love"" is godly, holy, and a right type of love. Clearly, this is not Shakespeare's intent. In his play, Shakespeare has Romeo and Juliet surrounded in dark imagery. The absence of light (Juliet is Romeo's light) symbolizes that their love is doomed.

Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

It was the nightingale and not the lark,

That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.

Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.

Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. (Rom 3.5.1-5) Shakespeare uses the darkness imagery for a reasonto show that Romeo and Juliet's love is wrong.

A specific difference that shows Shakespeare's intent was not portrayed throughout the film was the scene where Romeo and Juliet first meet. In the play, readers clearly know that Romeo is wearing a mask when he arrives at the Capulet's party. There is no evidence throughout the text that Romeo takes his mask off when he first meets Juliet. This scene is essential to the play and Shakespeare's intent because it symbolizes the blindness and false appearance in Romeo and Juliet's love. Nevertheless, in Luhrman's film, Romeo arrives at the Caplet's party wearing a mask, yet removes it before he met Juliet.

Act Three of Romeo and Juliet is a crucial part in Shakespeare's play. The fighting scene between Mercutio, Romeo and Tybalt show the disorderly and uncontrollable passion that runs throughout Shakespeare's play. Bez Luhrman's film version of the scene captures Shakespeare's intended likeness of the play, perfectly. The film portrays the wild, runaway passions of the three extreme characters. Different than the play, a storm is beginning to form that prepares the reader for tragedy, specifically with the wind and thundering. Furthermore, since Shakespeare's work is a play, the actual description of the fight between Tybalt and Mercutio is not stated, the editor only puts in the stage direction: ""They Fight."" With Luhrman's film, viewers are able to see a violent fight taking place that results in Mercutio's inevitable wound.

The setting of the film is in a modern society. Shorts and Hawaiian shirt replace Renaissance gowns and men wearing tightsha-ha. In stead of swards, guns are the weapons (yet, they are referred to as swards in the movie). The effect of these modern day attributes is what makes the film worth watching. Viewers of the film can relate and appreciate the film as Elizabethans could have related to the play when it had been performed in the Renaissance.

Luhrmann's film adds up to a coherent whole by following through with the director's point of view of the lovers. He sees Romeo and Juliet as a story about the right type of love and is consistent throughout by surrounding the lovers in bright light and love songs. Therefore Baz Fuhrman's William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is a good film for only students of Shakespeare. Students of Shakespeare know the true intent of Romeo and Juliet and the values and concerns that had surrounded Elizabethans. Therefore, students can appreciate Luhrmann's interpretation of the film while also taking into consideration Shakespeare's interpretation of right love and reason. The general public, however, may not know Renaissance background and the concepts of reason, right vs. wrong love, and appearance vs. reality. Thus, the general public could misinterpret the film or not even understand it at all.

RomeoJuliet,Creative interpretation of Shakespeare's Great Love story,8/10,acisnotsped86,18/11/2005,"I will be the first to admit bias because I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, much credit must also be given to the creative team for their modern remake of R&J. The movie, like Moulin Rouge as one example, has put a great deal of time into costume, settings and music. As a side note, the soundtrack for R&J is phenomenal and I still listen to it nearly 10 years later. The story stays very true to the play with Elizabethan English instead of modern English. One big surprise is the portrayal of Mercutio. All I can say is that this definitely was not Shakespeare's intention, but it's quite amusing. The use of Elizabethan English in a modern interpretation of Shakespeare has one evident drawback; seeing people in the modern age speaking in such a fashion can make the movie seem a bit silly at times. Other than that, I loved it and the romantic aspect in the movie was so well done. I simply wish that the DiCaprio and Danes had a better cast working with them. Particularly for the parents. No excuses for not finding older actors who can handle Shakespeare, especially since they found the aforementioned stars who handled it quite well.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Excellent film.,10/10,pogomog,4/11/2005,"I thought Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Romeo was particularly outstanding. Along with the amazing performances by Claire Danes, and the awesome dude who played Mercutio.

I was also very impressed that the Director stayed committed to the original language used by Shakespeare - I think if the language had been edited it would have lowered the standard of the film considerably.

Along with works like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and 'The Basketball Diarys', I really have to give props to DiCaprio, and rate him as a truly excellent young actor. And if I was a chick, I'd totally hit that :P

Also brilliant was the sets, costumes, and pretty much everything! The last thing that made it awesome for me was the soundtrack. Anything with Radiohead is going to be good, but the other music was great to. 'Talkshow Host' by Radiohead takes the cake though! It fit in PERFECTLY with the feeling of this movie.

I thought this was outstanding, and I definitely recommend it!",pos
RomeoJuliet,Captures the true spirit of Shakespeare's play,9/10,greenbay938,31/10/2005,"Anyone who truly knows Shakespeare and his works knows that it's all in the tempo, and mood of the performance that makes it great. His plays were made to be fun and entertaining even if you couldn't understand any of the puns, twists or important plot points that Shakespeare is so clever in placing. Those things were in to please the upper-class and the ""critics"". But the Globe had a pit. Where the poor filed in for a good show. While Zeffirelli's version is how the events would have played out in real life, Luhrmann's adaptation is true to how the drama would have been played out on the stage. There's really nothing like hearing the meter of Shakespeare's writing come out in the fast paced dialogs that fills this film. The speech conveys such meaning and is beautifully strung as you would have read it in the original text.

RomeoJuliet,The way Shakespeare should be viewed,10/10,benturkalj,31/10/2005,"When Baz Lurman decided to make a Shakespeare movie, he wanted to recreate the experience as it was in it's day, or in other words make it fun again. And that's just what he achieved with this well conceived drama.

Set in Venice beach instead of the original Venice, Italy, all of the dialog is kept with some clever referencing used to help thread some of the problems into the story.

Using a great sense of style, the film generally moves at a thrilling pace, with sometimes bizarre use of the camera making for an exceptional visual experience. All of the acting is well above standard, with kudos to Leonardo Decaprio and Clare Danes, though everyone does a top class job.

The score is also top notch, taking some of the best bands and using them effectively to help create the right mood. If your a purist, you may dislike this quirky film, but if you want to see Shakespeare in an exciting portrayal, then this is well worth seeing.",pos
RomeoJuliet,"Definitely worth watching, but upsetting to Shakespearean lovers",9/10,Amusic20,24/10/2005,"I first fell in love with Shakespeare's story of the most well-known star-crossed lovers my freshman year in high school, whereupon I read the play and acted out the part of Juliet in my Global Cultural Studies class. (And ever since then, I have dreamed of playing Juliet). It's hard to describe why exactly I feel this way, though it's one of (if not, the) my favorites. I received this 1996 version with young DiCaprio and Danes as a present for my 15th birthday in May 2002. Since then, I have watched it several times, and once even in French. In my opinion, this is a wonderful life, and I was surprised by how accurately DiCaprio and Danes played the title roles. And, just as the producer had hoped (which he says on an interview on the DVD), having this play take place in modern times--in California--does help the viewers to understand Shakespeare's complex (yet beautiful) language, although now that I am in a Shakespeare class I would have understood it anyway. However, avid Shakespeareans may be upset with the ending of the play (this is the spoiler): instead of having Juliet wake up at least a couple minutes after Romeo has drunk the poisoned vial and died, Luhrmann decides to have Juliet and Romeo see each other right before his death--but unfortunately, they do not see each other in time to stop this horrible outcome. It has a quite a different effect, if you think about it!! Yet, one cannot help but just love the story nonetheless, and the fact that it's American and starring actors we know may make the film appear to us more. But whatever it is, I loved it!",pos
RomeoJuliet,Simply Astonishing,9/10,harriet-evans,22/10/2005,"As a fan of Baz Luhrman and Shakespeare, I just had to see this film. And my verdict is: Amazing.

In English (GCSE) we are studying Romeo and Juliet and we have watched now Zeferelli's version and this. I have to say they are both good films in their own right, but this one really has brought Shakespeare into the 21st Centuary. I love the way the film is shot and the choice of actors is interesting. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing Romeo and Harold Perrineau is astonishing as Mercutio (the best character in the film).

I have to say, if you see one version of Romeo and Juliet (bar theatre) you simply must see this, it has a few loop holes but is generally all round good with one or two excellent scenes.

RomeoJuliet,fabulous adaptation.,9/10,6045,21/10/2005,"Luhamann's adaptation of romeo and Juliet was by far the best i have ever come across. It was modern and contemporary, but still kept the original text, which was absolutely genius. The film was dramatic, extravagant, romantic, and stunning. and happens to be one of my favourites of all time, and truly made me think of Shakespeare in a different light.

Mercutio was absolutely fabulous, charismatic, and his flamboyant clothes represented his personality spot on.

The ending however, was slightly surprising, as Juliet used a gun instead of a sword to take her life. However, an incredible film, which is well worth taking a look at.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Set the Trends for the late 1990s and early 2000s,7/10,stephen_thanabalan_fans,1/9/2005,"William Shakespeare's masterpiece definitive romantic tale already had love, passion, tragedy and unbeatable literary genius. What Baz Luhrmann did was to turn up its volume, slap on the sunscreen and yell out (captured essentially through the way Leonardo DiCaprio cried in the murder scene) to the world in the midst of a 1996 drag party at the beach.

And what a scream it let out too. Whilst not initially blockbuster fare, it hit the underground and worked itself into the mainstream due to its raw energy- what later became the hallmark of Baz Lurhmann's film signatures when he completed 2001's now celebrated, Moulin Rouge. The film was yelling out to the world way ahead of its time. From the fashion in the film, the stylings of the film all the way to the flair and even hairstyle of the lead characters, this film oozed trend-setter. That it went on to launch Leonardo DiCaprio and his floppy fringe, furrowed brow and a cigarette dressed in a suit without a tie (spanning millions of teenage admirers and copycats the world over), was just the one element of the show's powerful placement as one of the defining pieces of cinema in the 1990s.

Till that time, teenage fare (if people even still consider this film to be as such) was considered fluffy - one must remember that the film was launched in 1996 - with only shows like 'My Own Private Idaho', 'Reality Bites' or even 'Clueless' before it, whilst it way ahead of the teenage movie formulaic explosion that took place after 1998/99, and even the better of those never could touch this film's raw energy, angst, stylistics nor emotion. That was how powerfully strong the undertones and reverberations surrounding this teenage culture defining movie of the 1990s was.

And yet again, it was not just a teen flick- it had the essence of literary prose still entrenched in within, it had a flair for style unseen in any movie at the time (thereby establishing Baz Lurhmann as a revolutionary), and combined with the editing, musical layout & soundtrack (The Wannadies, etc) and sparklingly romantic scenes like the 'fish tank' wooing sequence, it was pure Shakespeare with a twist, and a delectable shout at the beach to stop the world to take notice.",pos
RomeoJuliet,excellent movie... DiCaprio & Danes are magnificent.,9/10,cineasten89,25/7/2005,"First of all, I want to tell that I haven't watched this movie before and that the first time I did watch this was yesterday. Further, I can say that by watching this movie I understood what I've been missing... Danes and DiCaprio is such a great couple in this movie... This is such a truths worthy and realistic movie, all authentic to the Shakespeare story except from that fact that the story is moved from Verona in the 16th century to present time in Verona Beach and some changed lines, some changed scenes and a bit modernized story. Beautiful scenes, beautiful cinematography, sad story, fine person chemistry between Danes and DiCaprio. Can say that if the book was for grown ups, then this movie is mostly for teenagers and younger.

RomeoJuliet,Baz Luhrman deserves great recognition,10/10,stemd03,8/5/2005,"Baz Luhrman did the impossible, altered a classic without making it seem horrible. Luhrman's portrayal of a modernized telling of Shakespeare's classic tale, hints a lot at underlying themes. When I was younger I thought this was a great love story, when you are older you understand that it is explaining the carelessness of teenagers and a lack of understanding of love. Leading and supporting actors deserved awards for their performances. But my absolutely favorite thing about Baz Luhrman films is his camera movement. It is just so creative, and holds your interest, your eyes scan the screen for what is happening next. Soundtrack and scenery is amazing. If you have not seen this movie yet, go out and get a copy.

RomeoJuliet,"R + J, a masterpiece that glows like a Star",10/10,mahmoud-3,22/4/2005,"""I give thee my heart before requested, and if I had it...I would give it again."" - Juliet

I recall going to the movies theater for that movie, and half of the people left the theater at the Interval to my greatest shock. I know this is a film that will always have a 5 to 6 rate out of 10, simply because there are people who will love it and there are others who will not catch its beauty.

R + J a film with ambulances, cops, cars, dollars and pistols replacing swords and elements of the greatest love story of all times, and yet the film has incredibly achieved the greatest harmony ever between the filming of a modern story with the majestic beauty of an old script, it is such a mixture at which one can only stop time and enjoy this masterpiece that only an extra-ordinary true artist can possibly bring out to the reality of our somewhat too modern life.

R + J the story & the film come into harmony, and delightfully not as a mummy walking out of its tomb, but as a joyful piece of ballet, being performed on a stage of clouds.

Thumbs up to Bazz Luhrmann, Thumbs up to love & Thumbs up to R + J.

RomeoJuliet,Go Go shakesphere,10/10,sammybolton,18/4/2005,"the most amazing action and romance i've ever seen the actors play fantastic i always fell emotion in side me when i watch this film ill give it 5 ***** and recommend it to anyone

It is indeed a timeless piece of work, Shakespeare's scenario of the most shocking love-drama the world has ever seen. Without doubt the leading character Romeo - as yet alone is suggested by his name - is a perfect prototype of a Gothic-Romantic. He is the fine young thinker, philosopher and visionary, who suffers from the misfortune of having been born into a false world. A world which despises his feelings in a most brutal manner, so that he can only free his soul by his spectacular self chosen death.

RomeoJuliet,I loved it.,10/10,niamhpkenny,13/2/2005,"I absolutely loved this movie!! It was just so well done!! It was so sad that i cried though. And i love Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes! They're both so young and cute! If it had been different actors i don't think i would have cried so much, especially if it hadn't been Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't understand why it only has a rating of 6.7! It was just so brilliantly made. I loved how they made it modern. It was really clever. And all the actors were really good and suited their parts so well. It is a really magical love story. If anyone hasn't seen it, I would completely recommend it, but be aware that it is very likely that you will cry! I just can't write how much I loved it. I really hope you all go and see it, cos if you're afraid they have ruined the classic, they really haven't. They use the same lines, and you'll recognise quotes.

RomeoJuliet,romeo and juliet is the best film of all time,10/10,princessholl,3/10/2004,"I bought this film afew weeks ago after it was recommended by one of my friends. i watched it and it was the best, most exciting and emotional film I have ever seen. leonardo and clare are fantastic actors and deserve a lot of credit because without them I don't think the film would of been quite as fantastic as it is. well done for this brilliant film! My favourite part in this fab film is when romeo and juliet first meet. It is so romantic. The soundtrack for this film is also very, very good!

RomeoJuliet,Great remake of the most classic lovestory ever told.,9/10,cashhoney2000,22/9/2004,"When Baz Luhrman decided to replace the guns for swords and still have the cast speaking just as Shakespeare did, I fell in love with this story all over again. The acting was great, the locations were excellent. The photography in the movie is excellent. There's only one thing I didn't like and that is Romeo and Juliet should have had more on screen time together, just to show more depth to their love. I love this movie though! Its one of the only movies I know ALL the lines to. My favorite part is when Romeo sees Juliet for the first time through the fishtank. I can feel their excitement . This captures the love at first sight theme right on point. Who wouldn't fall in love with Leonardo DiCaprio though? I give this movie two thumbs up!

RomeoJuliet,The good and the bad of Romeo + Juliet,8/10,JulietsDagger,26/8/2004,"Romeo + Juliet (1996) Directed by Baz Luhrmann. With Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes

THE PLOT: Two teenagers from feuding families instantly fall madly in love with each other.

THE GOOD: Just like Baz Luhrmann's more recent effort Moulin Rouge!, this is another movie you either love or hate. I really enjoyed this version of William Shakespeare's famous play. I thought the acting was very good considering the script is in fact Shakespeare. Not all people will think this, but I thought the modern day, original script combination was brilliant. A lot of good cinematography, particularly in the last couple of scenes.

THE BAD: I didn't really enjoy the typical Luhrmann direction in the first half hour of the film, it just didn't seem to fit well with the piece. Like I said before, some people won't like the idea of putting the original Shakespeare script in the present time period. A lot of people are particular about the acting in Shakespeare movies, so it's really up to you to decide whether the acting is good or bad.

MY RATING: 7.5/10",pos
RomeoJuliet,Brilliant,10/10,rebeccaj04,18/7/2004,"This modern day version of the best ever love story of all time is to me amazing. Dicaprio and Danes have a on-screen romantic connection like I've never seen before. They seem to click so brilliantly. The setting and music and script is just perfect. The mix of the violence from the youths and the romance between Romeo and Juliet is so special to this film, its what makes it. The ending is to some very depressing but also if it didn't happen it wouldn't make the film what it is. Dicaprios acting is to its best in this film and Danes is not as bad herself, the combination was great. I haven't seen another adaption of this story made as greatly as this one. Great love story so id give it a 8/10. A definite one to watch.

RomeoJuliet,"excellent job by cast, very good movie",9/10,bsl05,20/4/2004,"I actually saw this movie in the theater and wasn't much interested going into it (read: my girlfriend, now wife, chose the movie that night). As I watched, the movie was lacking very much until the scene where DiCaprio and Danes meet with ""Kissing You"" being sung in the background. That part changed the whole movie for me because of the easily recognized chemistry between the two of them - all without saying a word. Since then I have come to appreciate this movie even more, and watch anytime it's on TV.

The acting is excellent. So good in fact, that the ending everyone knows will happen seems illogical - you believe they deserve so much better, that it will work out. Leo showed why he was one of the best actors in Hollywood, pre-Titanic. And I don't mean ""best under 25 or 30 years old,"" I mean overall. Before the Titanic backlash, he was as solid as anyone. Also, Perrineau was unbelievable, stealing every seen he was in. And Leguizamo again shows why is such a highly underrated actor. I believe Danes was perfect casting for Juliet, nailing the role.

The style may turn a lot of people off, but Baz Luhrmann made it worked very well as he always does. Overall, this is a very good movie carried by the exceptional performances of the mentioned actors and even Pete Postlethwaite in a small role being his usual solid self.

RomeoJuliet,"Well, I liked it.",7/10,burgan6203,4/4/2004,"Baz Lurhmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" doesn't even come close to ""Moulin Rouge""(a truly beautiful, artistic film IMO);it is uneven in numerous instances and the editing usually is a bit too wild. Having said this however, I would like to admit that I enjoy this movie. Baz is wonderfully creative, and even if the results aren't entirely successful, there's still more imagination here than in many other mainstream films. And what about the scene at the party, where Romeo and Juliet regard each other through the fish tank? That is a genuinely lovely, tender moment, as is the balcony(or pool)scene. But for those who find this version too iconoclastic, try the Zeffirelli version; I like them both.

RomeoJuliet,This has to be the best Romeo and Juliet and needed to be made.,10/10,Willowi,5/1/2004,"Out there there are a lot of Romeo and Juliet films. Some cartoon, some real people but none well known. Romeo and Juliet(1996) introduced the story and the words to a generation of people. It used the words of William Shakespeare and his story ut brought it bang up to date. It used clever details to make it as close to Shakespeare as possible but didn't use men in tights. Even people who don't understand Shakespeare will love this film as the wonderful acting speaks for itself. This is a complete MUST-SEE.

RomeoJuliet,An brilliant revamp of a classic piece,9/10,sp00ge,22/10/2003,"Baz Luhrman and Craig Pearce's interpretation of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet is a brilliant revamp of a classic piece. Rather than taking the more traditional approach of capturing the story's essence but using a new script, Romeo + Juliet maintains the original Shakespeare script. However Luhrman goes far beyond simply translating the play into a screenshow as so many filmmakers have done in the past.

The film takes place in a somewhat modern-day Verona with a strong flex of his poetic license muscle. Swords are transformed into guns, horses to cars. Prior to seeing the film, when I heard about it I was wildly skeptical of how it could be a good film. I'm very much a Shakespeare fan and appreciate his works in their more ""original"" form. However Luhrman does an astounding job of the transformations that take place and they actually work very well on screen. It doesn't take a very big leap of faith on the audience's part to accept a gun for a sword. It amazes me how well Shakespeare's script works in a modern setting. On top of the translations, the visuals and filmography are very appealing and do the rest of the film justice.

I personally found the acting to be quite good throughout the film, however I'm not usually too nitpicky about acting, I try to see the film on the whole. My personal favorites are Leguizamo as Tybalt and Danes as Juliet, and Perrineau as Mercutio.

Overall I consider the movie to be a fresh new approach to a very old classic. It is a pleasant departure from the stagnant traditional approach to modernizing, revamping, or transforming plays or older films.

It will always be one of my all-time favorites.

RomeoJuliet,review of the film (my rating = 8/10) - may contain spoilers,8/10,steinbergdavid,15/5/2003,"There are three types of Shakespeare films. The first are traditional Shakespeare films which remain wholly faithful to the original plays. The second are modernised Shakespeare films which update or contemporise certain aspects of the original plays while retaining Shakespearian language. The third are films which are loosely based on Shakespeare, usually just on the plot of the plays updating everything else including the language.

Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet retained the Shakespearian language but cast two unknown and definitely not Shakespearian teenage actors in the two main roles of Romeo and Juliet. The film cut some of the dialogue from the original play which the director felt was unnecessary and would bore the audience, not being vital to the story. The film contained several contemporary flourishes and was ultimately a visual feast of a film rather than a filmed play with theatrical sets and scenery. However, although it succeeded as a film rather than a filmed play, this version of Romeo and Juliet was almost entirely faithful to the original play in comparison to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet, which updated everything there is to update, while retaining the Shakespearian language, cutting unnecessary dialogue, updating the setting to Verona Beach, Los Angeles, replacing swords with guns, using cars, casting two very un-Shakepearian actors in the lead roles of Romeo and Juliet and more.

You cannot compare this film with Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet simply because you cannot compare a film whose plot is a modernised Shakespeare story and whose language is that of Shakepeare's original text (along with some editing) with a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play that may introduce several contemporary flourishes but nevertheless remains a traditional and faithful film version of the play. Zeffirelli's version is obviously the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but likewise Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet is the best modernisation of Shakespeare's play. Luhrmann's version is essentially a film while Zefferelli's is essentially a play made into a film.

As for the quality of acting, the level of traditional Shakespearian acting is higher in Zeffirelli's than it is in Luhrmann's, which is why Luhrmann's is a true modernisation of the play. This is not Leonardo di Caprio's very best performance, but it ranks among his best, which include 'The Basketball Diaries', 'This Boy's Life' with Robert De Niro and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' in which he gives his undeniably greatest and easily most amazing performance as a mentally handicapped boy. His acting in the film was so convincing that people thought that the director had cast a real mentally handicapped boy in the role (Leonardo Di Caprio was unknown when he made the film in 1993).

Still, in Romeo+Juliet he shows good acting ability in his violence, passion, romance and the characteristic innocence and obsessional love of Romeo. Many people have complained that he speaks his lines as if they are meaningless and that he 'loses' the emphasis of some of the lines that he rapidly delivers. As for myself, I heard every line that he and all of the other actors spoke, and his unconventional rapid delivery of the lines only adds to the fast and furious atmosphere of the entirely unconventional film and emphasises the fact that the text mostly constitutes conversations between people, not soliloquys and speeches, although there are some. Therefore he makes his lines in conjunction with those of other actors in the film sound like part of a conversation, rather than delivering his lines slowly and deliberately, pausing after very important lines. People have also complained that Leonardo di Caprio goes 'way over the top', especially in the scene where he learns of Juliet's supposed death. However, this only adds to the atmosphere of the film, which is meant to be 'over the top'.

Also, the fact that the two main characters are played by two non-Shakespearian actors only emphasises the fact that they are ordinary people who have experienced a tragedy in their short lives, rather than Shakespearian actors who deliver their lines with far more pretention and exuding a higher status than those 'below' in the audience, as it would have seemed in theatres in Shakespeare's days and in theatres today. Admittedly, though, the two actors who play Romeo and Juliet in Zeffirelli's version are also non-Shakespearian actors.

Luhrmann's film is also an undeniable visual extravaganza, with contemporary flourishes of western-type shoot-outs and other alterations such as the balcony scene, controversially held in Juliet's swimming pool.

Modernised versions of Shakespeare should, in my opinion, be accessible to everyone, not just those who love Shakespeare. In retaining the original language (something that is rare in modernized Shakespeare) Luhrmann could have confused the ordinary movie-goer, but instead he fuses action and visual aid with Shakespeare's language so effectively that the audience is never confused as to the trajectory of the plot.

In comparison to other modernised Shakespeare films (which update or contemporise certain aspects of the original plays while retaining the Shakespearian language) this surely ranks as one of if not the best. Indeed it is difficult to recall any other films that retain the original language or text while updating certain aspects of the play. The original language is probably the biggest feature of the film that gives it a high rank, for it introduces young and old audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeare to his brilliant language while revealing how thrilling the plots of his plays actually are, by using bright and colourful settings, scenery and action. The two main roles are backed up by a brilliant cast of cameos including experienced Shakespeare actors Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino, among others.

This is a brilliant film which, although not one of the very greatest (The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption etc.) definitely deserves a rating of 8/10.",pos
RomeoJuliet,Visually stunning,6/10,kuumauros,11/3/2003,"When I first started to watch this movie I had my opinions, which luckily were proved to be wrong. This movie has the plot of Romeo and Juliet (young man falls in love with the rival family's daughter).

This movie was very stylish, the visuals were great and the actors were also pretty good(especially the one who played the priest I can't remember his name).

Luhrmann succeeded in creating a world almost like our own but with some touch of surreality which was strenghtened by the shakespearian dialogue. In only few points did the dialogue bother me and that was when there wasn't great deal to say.

In the end, the movie was really entertaining with a touch of magic in it(especially in the water tank sequence). This movie deserves 5 or 6 out of Ten. 6/10

RomeoJuliet,Not what you expect to see after reading the play.,10/10,StephanieGould,15/5/2002,"After reading the play by Shakespeare, seeing the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey, I was apprehensive and excited at the same time. From the moment the movie started you knew it wasn't your typical tale of the two star-crossed lovers. This was action packed and romantic. It showed that Romeo + Juliet were stupid teenager who thought they only had one way out. I felt there was a more human and realistic quality to the acting as well as the setting. It helped teenagers of today relate to the story and learn from it. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors. They were even before I saw this film. I have seen it many times since its 1996 release. It is still one of my favorite versions of Romeo + Juliet. I really recommend it ; not just for the acting, but as a thrilling visual as well. The use of color and lighting was amazing too. Props to the director . Good job.

RomeoJuliet,The Best Modern Adaptation of the Classic Tale,10/10,Matt73,17/10/2000,"This is just the best modern adaptation of the classic Romeo and Juliet! Baz Luhrmann is really doing a GREAT job, not to mention the great casts! Well, I'm not DiCaprio's fan, but he was really good in his role, especially when he shouted Juliet's name in vein and also in the dying scene.

RomeoJuliet,Beautiful portrayal of love,9/10,erka_bean,22/9/2000,"They did an extremely wonderful job of showing love through this movie. Much better than all the others I've seen. My only complaint is that it seems that the actors don't really KNOW or feel what their lines meant when Shakespeare wrote them. It's really hard to understand the writing from that time so no one noticed except us Shakespeare freaks who find it as painful as nails on a chalk board when there's a pause between ""Do with their death"" and ""bury their parents' strife."" But all in all, wonderfully done for trying to modernize, yet keep the same poetry of a classic tragedy.

RomeoJuliet,R&J In A Modern Setting,10/10,Mike-DD,19/8/2000,"I sure enjoyed this adaptation of Romeo & Juliet. It was unsettling at first to see a modern setting and music score (especially since I've seen the traditional version in high school so many times for literature classes), but once I got used to it, it was actually quite innovative and stimulating.

It took a bit of getting used to seeing actors in modern garb spout Shakespearean English, but the movie, while taking poetic license with the script, did stick to the basic premise of the play. Claire Danes as Juliet was a perfect casting in my view, what I'd expect a traditional Juliet to look like, although I thought DiCaprio looked just a tad too 'soft' to be Shakespeare Romeo.

RomeoJuliet,Chillingly original take on the classic love story turned 20th century,10/10,physco,12/7/2000,"I absolutely love this movie. My parents weren't thrilled about me seeing it when i was 9 when it was released on video and in the theaters so i read the play before it was even out. I am the only one of my friends that can say that i read romeo and juliet when I was 8 and understood it. Clair Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio just totally hit it in this movie. Many people think that the movie is just a gangbanning play off of the classic 15th century play but it isn't and it especially speaks to the new generation. The sound track is amazing. I used to have it but my brother broke it in half but if you have a chance to hear it listen to it. Especially the theme song by Des'rea. This movie is just so touching. So many opportunity to stop them from killing them selves but it just went by. You'll be asking yourself why didn't the deliverer ask for romeo. Why didn't the Priest stop romeo's friend. Why did juliet have to touch his face and not his leg. so many questions one fatal answer.

RomeoJuliet,Totally a must-see!,10/10,AprilMeeks,8/6/2000,"This is incredible! I've never seen any other R&J movies, but I'm glad I saw this one. It's awesome. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were the perfect leads for this movie. The whole cast does a brilliant job. I love how they made the characters come to life and be believable. And the modern day twist was great. Not only do Leo and Claire do an awesome job, but so does Jamie Kennedy (he plays the pink haired 'Sampson', a.k.a. 'Randy' in the Scream movies). This is one of my favorite movies, and chances are that you'll love it too. If you think you won't like it, give it a chance..... It's a movie that I'd recommend to everyone to see.

Go see it! What art thou waiting for? 10/10 A+++

RomeoJuliet,Surprisingly underrated: almost a masterpiece. (possible little spoilers?),9/10,Brest,30/5/2000,"Is it possible to re-tell the most renowned love story of the Western culture in a new and modern way? Buz Luhrmann demonstrates that it is possible, even nowadays: also, he shows how great the Bard was: using His literal verses with modern fast MTV clip style, the director put together a piece of cinema which is both highly original and dazzlingly baroque. A parallel and multi-dimensional universe is built: parallel not only to the classic literature, of which the film constitutes a blasting update, but also to the Hollywood industry, with the great choice of Mexico City as major outdoor location. Using the Di Caprio - icon when it was not yet overworked by the Titanic phenomenon, the film maker casts the best possible Romeo Montague in the Nineties, matching him with a baby faced but strongly hearted Clare Danes; with her, Di Caprio plays the best scene of the year (by the aquarium), a touching and subtle metaphor of the discovery of the ""other"", both surrounded with the mellifluous chant which is the main film song. All in all: original, with a striking incipit, a fabulous overall casting, and a generous display of great, outrageous visuals (the party, the interior of the church, the aerial shots). Definitely one of 1997 best ones, and a conspicuous 9/10!",pos
RomeoJuliet,Good time,8/10,Markark,19/4/2000,"I thought this was a good damn time at the movie. Put it with Strictly Ballroom, and ya got two good damn times at the movies. There are lots of ways to do Shakespeare, and this one had a good beat and was easy to dance to. So they couldnt read the lines. They looked fabulous, the music was terrific, it was exciting, and the story cant be beat. On to Macbeth.

RomeoJuliet,"Uneven film, with notable performances",5/10,Jimmy-128,7/3/2000,"""R+J"", when it works, works very well. When it doesn't, it's ludicrous. It boasts some fine performances, including that of Leonardo DiCaprio (remember when we were all falling over ourselves to praise him? He hasn't changed; the material he's been offered lately is simply not up to his earlier films), Harold Perrineau Jr., Miriam Margolyes, Pete Postelthwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Sorvino (okay, I'm biased in favor of those last two). Claire Danes, for some reason, doesn't work here; like DiCaprio, she's better than she's usually given credit for, but the usual fire is absent here. Don't even get me started about John Leguizamo, because he is just plain ludicrous. Tybalt is supposed to be a badass, and Leguizamo cannot even remotely carry that off. I kept wondering why Perrineau didn't just stuff him into a locker and be done with it.

The movie works best when it underplays and gives the audience a chance to enjoy finely nuanced performances. When it goes for the usual sensory-overload so prized by Fox, it resembles a bad episode of ""The A-Team"" (if that isn't being redundant).",neg
RomeoJuliet,A different point of view,9/10,anon1mat0,2/3/2000,"This movie is different from other interpretations of the long known drama, and perhaps this is why its review is so mixed. First of all, if you are a purist, don't bother. Go rent something else. But if you are not, this is a wonderful play very well done, with a very good cast (I particularly don't like di Caprio but here the guy is good). From my point of view, this movie keeps the essence of the drama and puts it on something close to L.A. Hey there are still some people who don't like West Side Story either! If you like the classics and you are open minded this is a movie worthy of your time.

RomeoJuliet,A visual masterpiece,9/10,scullyfox,29/2/2000,"This film cannot fail! It has the timeless story of love, romance, comedy and tragedy, which has been beautifully placed in a modern setting. The dialogue hasn't been altered but the style has been updated incredibly well, making it a stunning film, so pleasing to the eye.

Even if you do not like Di Caprio, its hard to deny that he plays the part beautifully and is believable as this starry-eyed young man, so different from his peers. Danes is also great as Juliet and plays the part with understated strength. The one thing which I didn't like was the chemistry between them - it could have been more intense.

My favourite things about this film were the little details, like the guns belonging to the Montagues and Capulets which bore inscriptions, like 'long sword' on the shot gun.

Finally I loved Pete P. as the vicar - especially that wonderful tattoo, just another aspect which feeds the eyes!!

See this film, it will restore your faith in romance!

RomeoJuliet,"Ah, What Doth the Producers Think They're Doing?",7/10,Amry,14/2/2000,"Well, first the good things about this movie. First of all, the acting quality is really good. Unlike, say, the Man in Iron Mask, DiCaprio managed to potray himself as a anguished, sensitive rich guy with a tormented heart. Like most other guys, I despise him, but I do appreciate good acting. The same goes to Claire Danes and the rest of the cast. The special effects, music and sound is also top notch. Kudos on that. I've watched the movie over and over again. Now for the bad things. First of all, I would rather have a revised dialog, instead of taking the lines straight out of the book. I mean, how many average-intelligent teenagers know the meaning of ""wherefore"" (it means ""why"") and other old English words? Of course, some of the memorable lines (""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"") shouldn't be changed. But otherwise, please, not everyone has a degree in English literature. As my linguistically-challenged friend said to me, ""this movie doth sucketh"". Well, that's all.

RomeoJuliet,If it weren't for the whelps...,7/10,batmite7,10/1/2000,"This movie would have been so good if it hadn't been for the stars. Claire Danes is not ""hot"". Really! I recently found out that Jennifer Love Hewitt was turned down for the role of Juliet. Tell me, is Danes THAT much hotter!? No. She's not.

And what can i say that isn't already been said about Leo. Dear merciful god is he bad. I mean, did this kid notlearn in high school after being stuffed in thousands of lockers that he sucks! I mean, he's a wuss! Why the hell does anyone like him! Hello, is any one listening!?

Oh, wait, this is suppose to be a movie review, not a teen actor smashing. The movie was good. The director was going for the Tarantino/Stone look, which i love. It had some awesome veteran actors in it which made the 'youngins' a tad better. But not much. Oh well...7 is about right i think.

RomeoJuliet,"Garish eye-candy, revamps classic love story with style",10/10,indiegirl26,24/12/1999,"Shakespeare was first and foremost, an entertainer. His job was to hold the interest and attention of the violent, uneducated rabble his all-male cast performed to, and if that meant introducing copious amounts of under-age sex, blood and vengeance, well then, so be it. Sword-fights, murder, betrayal, romance, black magic, secrecy, incest and insanity all frequently featured in his productions, some of which were performed right in front of our very own Virgin Queen Elizabeth I. They were there to grab the spectators attention, and then intoxicate them into the story, dialogue, characters and their lives to create a fantasy atmosphere that would prove to be so gripping, that they could not possibly wish to escape back to ye olde tavern for a pint of warm ale. And so today, Australian director Bazmark Luhrmann, most revered for his humorous and innovative spoof on Ozzie dancers in the independent film Strictly Ballroom' - and most hated for his annoying record, Sunscreen', has taken Shakespeare's sixteenth century storyline and spiked its coke with acid, to inject a clearer message to our Tarantino-worshipping Generation X - whoever they are. This is Shakespeare for the masses.

The setting of the film, Verona Beach is presented as a big, dusty, putrid city, filled with big dreams and small salaries. An amazing kitsch, Catholic statue of the Virgin Mary towers above the city alongside the Diet Coke ads, supported by a crude barrage of scaffolding. The ocean breeze whips the sand up to create an outstanding host of gritty effects during some of the latter fight scene, and with its soundtrack containing the Butthole Surfers and Everclear, one cannot escape this imaginary world of garish colours, excessive noise pollution and fairgrounds on the beach. It's like West Side Story for the common people - which is probably why I like it. Just joking.

The blur of brash and exciting colour fuels the film, dizzying the audience, enveloping us in its passion, displayed through the star performances of all the members of the cast, as each actor lives their part with true and devout conviction and dedication. The script has been cut drastically, but because of Luhrmann's clever use of imagery, symbolism and innovative direction, the core of the story is never lost or even left to incorrect interpretation. The transformation of the play, from a cliched stage of cod-pieces and tin-foil swords, into a powerful piece of cinema pushes both boundaries and emotions. Mercutio appears as a drug-pushing, African-American drag-queen, with more than a slight crush on Romeo yet despite the stilettos and faux-fur pink bra, still delivers a hugely accurate and captivating portrayal of the hero's best friend. The famous siloquoy where Mercutio describes the dangerous powers of love is intimately linked with the ingestion of some white dove e, and amazingly the two merge seamlessly. The masked ball is announced by the devilishly wicked Lady Capulet via cable television, and the extravagant event itself is a brash and dazzling trip. The two fathers are presented as archetypal Sicilian dons, with a tattooed Tybalt literally stealing every single scene he appears in. There is also a helicopter chase, plenty of shoot-outs, a stall called The Merchant of Venice', a mailing service known as Post. Post Haste', and Romeo's chill-out spot for introspection and smoking, the Sycamore Grove, turns out to be a derelict playhouse. This film is truly imagination working at its finest. The traditional balcony scene is transported beautifully to the Capulet's swimming pool, where Romeo, hiding in the shadows, surprises his crush, and together they hurtle into the water. This scene is fresh and witty, a continuous kiss-or-not-to-kiss. Claire Danes gives a passionate and sweet performance as Juliet, spicing up our heroine with a slice of 90s girl power, while DiCaprio is a strong and determined leading male, romantic with an element of vulnerability and adolescent awkwardness. Both are correctly portrayed as young innocents without voices, only finding themselves in eachother. Infact, Luhrmann fully exploits the sensuality and dramatic effect of water throughout the film. We first met our heroine staring face down in a basin of water, gazing languidly into the camera, stoned and angelic, her incredibly long red hair floating around and framing her pale and placcid face. Romeo is seen plunging his head into a sink of H2O following his dose of drugs, emerging with dripping wet hair, presently spying Juliet through the home of some tropical fish. The best scene provides the forum for Tybalt's murder, shot in a thunder storm, infront of the great Virgin Mary statue, where our victim hurtles back into the fountain, saturated in a heady mixture of water and his own blood. Symbolism litters this film like gold-dust at the bottom of a rainbow. Waking up beside Juliet following their illicit wedding night, scars coating his body, Romeo kisses Juliet and then prepares to leave. As she begs him to stay he grabs the bedsheets which billow over them, creating a protective white tent, before finally whipping the sheets up around them, sheltering them from the harsh daylight and the reality it inevitably brings. In fancy-dress, Romeo appears as a knight in shining armour, Tybalt as Satan, the Capulets as decadent classical characters, and Juliet as a vision-like angel. Needless to say this film is breathtaking to watch, providing a full two hours of unstoppable eye-candy. It has a fail-safe script, obviously, and an amazing soundtrack. Everyone can act in it, which is pretty rare these days, and everything fits together like lycra on an aerobics queen. A resounding full marks for the revamped Romeo and Juliet. Better than the simpering Shakespeare in Love' anyday.",pos

RomeoJuliet,Just Fabulous,10/10,Liz-66,17/8/1999,"I honestly think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know it's been panned as being an ""Mtv"" version of Shakespeare, but to that I say, so what? I mean, yes the movie's done with a fast pace and bright colors that give it a trendy, modern feel, but it also does an amazing job of conveying all the emotions of one of the greatest plays ever written by one of the greatest playwrights who ever lived. I've seen the much-acclaimed 1960s version, and honestly, I was bored. I think the choice of which parts of Shakespeare's work to use was MUCH better in the 1996 version. It seemed to me that the older one left out some of the most beautiful and poetic lines. Claire Danes is insanely talented as Juliet, and Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have been born to play the part of Romeo. Great supporting cast too, especially Mercutio. I highly recommend this film, one of my all-time favorites.

RomeoJuliet,surreal but with faults,10/10,rose-18,18/7/1999,"While this modern version of Romeo and Juliet does have problems, it succeeds enough to win my recommendation. Set in a world that seems modern but even somewhat out of this world, this visualization is like a Salvador Dali painting, fascinating, new, strange. Some faults include excess modernization or costuming like Pete Posthlewaite's tattoo, Tybalt's ""gangsta"" like slickness and definitely Mercutio's drag outfit! That last scene and also the first are very weak and the film can occasionally be a bit awkward. However, Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent. Both have done much of their previous and future work in depressing or tragic roles and both are very convincing with their agony and emotions here. Some of the cinematography is beautifully shot, notably the kiss in the elevator and the aquarium scene. This film should also be commended for exposing teenagers or other modern movie watchers to Shakespeare and how his work is completely relevant today.

RomeoJuliet,Shakespeare On Acid,7/10,great_sphinx_42,21/6/1999,"I found this adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" intriguing, though far from spectacular. I've never exactly decided whether or not I think it's good, but I do enjoy it. The love between Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio is quite nice, although it lacks the wild passion (particularly on Claire's part) that distinguishes this tale, and Pete Postlethwaite seems to be the only actor involves who seems as though he can truly handle the Bard. Nevertheless, I think it can only be a compliment to Shakespeare that his work continues to be interpreted in so many diverse ways hundreds of years after he wrote it. On that note, this is a brave experiment that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It is a study in style, with a unique, acid-art burn.

RomeoJuliet,Really thrusthworthy adoption of a classic play,10/10,hansi-8,2/3/1999,"Some of my fellow commentators are irritated about this movie because it ""looks like MTV"". You have to remember that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, when he wrote these timeless plays, and knew that in 400 years they could fit in to whatever society. I believe that he is rotating in his grave, because of the fear many actors had had adopting and brushing the dust of Shakespeare's works. Branagh's Henry V is brilliant theater, but I do not think it works as a movie.

In this film they have kept the respect for the old master in adopting the dialogue to modern american. And I think that Shakespeare in his heaven, is very pleased with that, because I do not think that Shakespeare expected people in 1996 to talk like they did at ""old Lizzys"" court

RomeoJuliet,Excellent,10/10,lhj87,21/2/2002,"Baz Luhrmann is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen. He goes past what everyone will think and does his own thing. An example would be his spectacular musical, ""Moulin Rouge!"" He did everything his way and it turned out to be something I truly enjoy. That's why it's up for the second most amount of Oscars tied with, ""A Beautiful Mind."" Now with Romeo and Juliet, Baz Luhrmann does an interesting twist. He exchanges the older setting for a modernized one. Many, I have heard did not appreciate this and probably did not believe that it should ever be done. However, Baz kept the language and proved a fact I have recently learned. My English teacher told my class that, ""Times change, but people don't."" That is demonstrated here in this film, the time changed, but the people did not. They shared the same hate, the same love, the same tragedy. Baz Luhrmann connected with a younger audience because I first saw this when I was 10 years old and somehow followed the story. I hadn't ever read Romeo and Juliet, but that movie gave me this craving to learn about it. So I waited to read it in school so I could learn what it meant and now I am. The movie was different, but it still showed me how Shakespeare's plays have stayed alive through all these years, and it also showed me that times do change, but people do not. It should not matter what way this was filmed or wasn't. Shakespeare borrowed a story told over time and made it his own. He made it the way he wanted it, and everyone does the same when they borrow something. They make it their own, just as Baz Luhrmann did. And people can personally hate it, but they should at least respect it. I personally believe that this was a great retelling of the classic play and now that I am reading Shakespeare's version, I am understanding more and more of the movie. To me, this was one in a million, and no one else could have pulled it off as great as he did.",pos

I really love this movie. 2 beautiful actors and actresses played together. Instead of using swords, they use guns which is very interesting. This movie is very easy to understand for someone who hse not known this story of romeo and juliet. good

RomeoJuliet,Brilliant!,10/10,robs-2,12/11/1998,"Quite simply brilliant and unmissable - a feast for the eyes and the ears with Di Caprio and Danes being the definitive star crossed lovers. Even the most die hard Shakespeare hater will be won over by this epic. It makes you wonder what director Baz Luhrmann will come up with next!!!! Don't be put off by all the MTV comparisons - I never ever watch MTV and LOVED this.

RomeoJuliet,"Fun, but not very good",6/10,escoles,15/12/2000,"While a much bigger-budget and more ""serious"" work, this isn't really nearly as good as Luhrmann's earlier _Strictly Ballroom_.

This wildly experimental movie is, overall, a dismal (albeit instructive) failure. The plot narrative arc runs parallel to _Strictly Ballroom_, beginning in a much wilder, freer, more experimental style early in the picture, shifting gradually over to a more conventional mode of storytelling about a quarter of the way in. As with the earlier picture, I wonder if the real reason for the switch is not that Luhrmann simply ran out of steam and energy for the frenetic editing.

The biggest failing is in the casting. While both exceptionally pretty, neither Danes nor diCaprio ever come to grips with the meaning in their lines -- falling victim to the most common failing when doing Shakespeare, they never manage to forget that the lines are supposed to be POETRY. Several supporting players, most notably Harold Perrineau as Mercutio and John Leguizamo as Tybalt, overcome this problem with ease. Perrineau in particular is flatly amazing, easily stealing every scene; that's not hard with material like Mercutio, but as so often happens with this play, a good Mercutio serves no end so much as to show up the weaknesses of the story in general (to wit, these are all a bunch of witless adolescents that most of us wouldn't give a thought to outside of The Theatre).

Good eye candy, and some really fine performances (although none from the principles).",neg
RomeoJuliet,"Why did Baz call this ""William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet""?",6/10,ad2020,23/11/2000,"Using this title in it's own right thumbs it's nose at the Bard!! Not that I'm a true member or anything, but pretension is going to have reaction's, most of which are going to be negative!!!! I haven't seen this flick for a while, but I do remember that everybody I associated with at the time absolutely despised it. I can see why, Shakespeare was a poet before a playwrite to my knowledge (don't hold me to it, I prefer his works to his life story!) so any well crafted dialogue of his is butchered for physical and visual effect in this movie, it's just wrong! Not to mention I find the acting to be thrown out for speed,and you can't just do what you please w/ the physical aspects of the original play, so many scenes that made the play a fatalistical tragedy are overwrought!! I have to give this movie it's due, though, it shows a great use of visual ability that should be used w/ these types of stories (even though it seems that Baz is trying to do everything that everybody else didn't with this movie) which does justice to the themes of this play. I'm not familiar with any of Baz Luhrmann's other work's, but after graduating to his sappy ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"", I'll be concise enough to say this is his best work (which definitely ain't saying a lot!) and that I'm afraid to meet him for fear of laughing at him or puking on him!

Revolutionary Road,"A dream is a wish your heart makes, then you wake up and it's time to go to work",10/9/2019,Smells_Like_Cheese,8-六月-09,"So a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided to watch a movie and wanted to see Titanic again, so of course we get to the sad ending where Jack dies, but Rose lived on to have an incredible life, I asked my sister ""I wonder what would've happened if Jack lived? Would he and Rose really have lasted like they thought they would have?"", she giggled and asked if I saw Revolutionary Road, I said no and she said to see this movie and my question would be answered. So here's something I never thought I would say, especially in 1997, thank God Jack died! OK, sorry for the lousy introduction, I always like to say how I saw the movie. But I didn't just want to see Revolutionary Road because of the reunion between the extremely talented Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, but also one of my favorite directors of all time Sam Mendes(American Beauty) who took on this project in the new telling of what the American Dream is and maybe it's not always what we had expected it to be.

Frank and April Wheeler moved to Revolutionary Road in one of New York City's wealthy Connecticut suburbs, and have a daughter and a son in hopes of living the American dream. But April is dissatisfied with her life as a suburban housewife, and Frank despises his marketing job at Knox Business Machines, where his father worked for twenty years in a similar position. They feel that they are unique and special, but trapped in the conformity of life in the suburbs, where they moved to raise their children. On Frank's birthday April surprises him with a birthday cake and a proposal that they move to Paris, with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. Frank is reluctant at first but ultimately embraces the idea, and the renewed optimism breathes fresh life into their relationship. Meanwhile, April becomes pregnant again, she wants an abortion and has bought a device she has heard is safe if used in the first twelve weeks. Frank disapproves. Later, Frank is offered a promotion and raise at work. Eventually he tells April that for the sake of the unborn baby he has decided not to go to Paris. Extremely unhappy, April starts to go crazy and screams her hatred for Frank as he still tries to continue to make the ""perfect and comfortable"" life for her.

This movie was really amazing, it's one of the most over looked Oscar wise from 2008, both Kate and Leonardo pull in heart wrenching performances. The thing about their characters is that I saw so much of my parents in them, they had all these amazing dreams together, were so in love, but then discover that life jumps in the front seat to what they really wanted to do. Kate's character, April, is receiving a lot of hate, but honestly I couldn't hate her, how could you? Yes, she said some awful things, but when it came down to it, she just wanted the man she fell in love with back again, she wanted to feel alive. The problem was both her and Frank were trying to run away from their problems, then Frank got comfortable; honestly, who knows what would have fixed their problems? But I do recommend Revolutionary Road, I really thought it's a small masterpiece and will get more recognition in the future I hope.

Revolutionary Road,Thought-provoking and sad.,10/8/2019,esale1,6-二月-09,"Having been a 50s housewife with children at home and a husband who wanted to be anywhere but there, this movie was familiar territory. How many of us in those years simply packed our dreams away for the immediate necessity of putting food on the table and paying the mortgage? Di Caprio is outstanding, as is Winslet, she having to deal with an American accent along with the tearing emotions. I didn't see that anyone picked up on the final scene, of Kathy Bates and her husband, but to me that was the whole moral of the story - here is where you will end up if you give in to what you know is not right for you. Overall, though, well done - except women in the 50s did NOT wear hats to work!!

Revolutionary Road,Thirsting for,10/9/2019,cdoyle-3,27-十二月-08,"Love, it's a curious thing. When it's fresh it is new, it is exciting and you wake up every morning just aching to spend another day with the person you love. Then you get married, have kids perhaps and things change. You fight. You fight over NOTHING. You grow to loathe the person you used to love to wake up next to. The world closes in on you and things don't seem the same anymore. You daydream about what life used to be like, how much love you used to be in and ask yourself - what happened??? Frank and April Wheeler meet and fall in love at a party. They talk about how their lives are going to be extraordinary and they are going to be different. They are going to live in Paris. They are never going to be ""those people"" in the suburbs. That isn't what life has in store for them. However life happens, April gets pregnant and they have to settle for a life more ordinary than they had planned for with the promise that someday, they will return to their dreams and complete them.

The Wheeler's dreams do not ever become reality and as the bleak expanse of life stretches out ahead of April she decides to reach out for her personal brass ring and convince Frank that they are better than their home on Revolutionary Road and Frank's job with his father's company and are meant for the greatness that they once talked about having in Paris. April quickly begins to hope again that not only will her life change to what it should have been but that her and Frank will fall back in love again. Frank falls in love with the idea and agrees to go, but has reservations about leaving the job he hates but that gives him a purpose in life. The plans are only a temporary band-aid as their glass house of dreams tumble around them and become a shattered illusion of what it used to be.

This movie is not one that you will send your entire family to see - or even your good friends. It isn't one that everyone will get or even WANT to get. However, this movie will tear out the heart of the people that have been in a relationship that has gone sour and were powerless to stop it. You try everything to stop the inevitable train wreck you see coming but yet, it still ends in a fiery crash and you stand and wonder how your life could end up this way. That's Frank and April and you will come to love and hate them by the end of this movie.

The acting in this movie is beyond amazing because it's simple and not overdone by the lead actors. Many things are not ever said - nor needed to be said - and were played with a flick of emotion across the face. I watched this movie expecting Kate to be the one to blow me away as usual and was shocked when it was Leo that knocked my socks off. I felt little sympathy for Frank in the novel but in the movie he plays him so well you can't help but feel sorry for him. I must mention that the supporting roles in this movie are nothing to sneeze at as well.

If you are looking for a wholesome family movie that will melt your heart, this isn't it. However, if you are willing to deal with a bit of stark reality - this is the movie for you. It rocked me harder than American Beauty ever did.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Truth is usually in singular - Lies always come in plural.,10/8/2019,natasha-bishop,16-十二月-08,"I saw an advance screening of Revolutionary Road in Beverly Hills, CA this evening (December 14th). A Q&A session followed the screening with Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn, and screenwriter Justin Haythe. Photos from the Q&A are attached to this report.

Revolutionary Road is a story that you won't be able to shake easily. The film will stick in your head and leave you to contemplate what has just happened on the screen before you. Richard Yates gives us the story of Frank and April Wheeler, the seemingly perfect suburbia couple. We soon find out their marriage is teetering on the edge of a collapse as they are overwhelmed by the fact that they have each made the wrong choices in their lives.

Once again Kate Winselt and Leonardo DiCaprio come together with great chemistry, pulling the best out of each other. This is a heavy film with emotionally complex characters, I'm not sure I could think of any two actors that could pull off the roles of Frank and April Wheeler like Leonardo and Kate did.

""Truth is usually in singular - Lies always come in plural."" I'm not sure who said that, but it is a notion that sums up this film.

Michael Shannon shinned in his role as the clinically insane son of Kathy Bates character; John Givings. Bates and Shannon both deliver humorous scenes to this heavy storyline, although there are times when you see the sadness and desperation in their characters as well. Michael Shannon's character, John Givings, is the truth in this film. Although clinically insane, he can see through everyone's lies and does the unthinkable; he forces everyone face their own truth.

I guarantee you will not be singing ""My Heart Will Go On"" after seeing this film. But you won't be disappointed with this little film gem.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Powerful - not for the oblivious,10/9/2019,wl323,28-十二月-08,"Revolutionary Road has been adapted from the same named novel of Richard Yates. The setting is a suburban area on the east coast in the mid-1950s. Surely there have been many changes of values in gender, society, and family over the decades. Yet,Revolutionary Road, whether the film or the novel, has never lost its power of confronting us, people living in the globalized 21st century, with all the existential issues – questions about life. This is the only movie that I have ever seen which can pose philosophical questions directly yet without compromising the engaging power of drama to its audience. It throws at us with questions about the meaning of life, our responsibility to live an authentic life, our freedom to make choices and decisions, our desire to connect with others and maintain independence, the fine line between the sane and the insane, the limitations of life, etc.

Apparently, April and Frank are diametrically opposite. April is revolutionary, striving for making changes and acting out her desires; Frank is reactionary, always playing safe and following paths opened by others. But, this is not true. Frank was ambitious before marriage. He conformed to the norm for a while, but deep down he felt regretful for the lost dream. Without that intrinsic desire, April would not be able to talk him into moving to Paris at all. (Again, Paris is just a symbol). What is less obvious but crucial for the development of the story is April's passiveness to life. All we see is she pushing Frank to live a life he wants. But what about her? What is her passion about life? We just vaguely know that she wants to be special and live an interesting life. But what exactly it is about? Acting, maybe. But she decided to quit after some setback. Instead of dealing with her own disappointment, fear, uncertainty towards her dream, she averts her frustration by imposing her dream on Frank, making him believe it and actualize it. In doing so, she saved herself from failure to achieve her dream. But, she forbore her responsibility to live a life she wants. In short, both April and Frank possess the same two conflicting dynamics in their minds. It is just that the director highlights the contrast between the pair in order to create a tug-of-war situation, which effectively generates a tension throughout the movie. It is very hard to side with either April or Frank because they were in one in the first place. Personally, half of me goes with April and half of me goes with Frank.

Despite the fact that the story is thickly embedded with philosophical propositions, Revolutionary Road is still a very touching love story. From the moment April thrust her dream into Frank's hand, their love was doomed. Being disillusioned and feeling trapped in a life she hates, April became numb to life. There was no more love in her. As what she and Frank had said to their lunatic neighbor, life became empty and hopeless to April. That's how the love's gone. So was the unborn baby. So was April. A funny question arises from Frank's definition of insanity: according to Frank, insanity is the inability to communicate with another human being and inability to love. How many of us are totally sane then?

As always, DiCaprio's acting is wonderful. He is particularly convincing when getting across the vulnerability of Frank. Kate Winslet performs well. However, when I expected some liveliness in April at certain points in the movie, I did not see it. The dialogues and the cinematography are very clever and powerful. We as the audience might have left the theater with a lot of questions that we fear to answer. Just as likely, we might have walked away in reminiscene of our own struggles about living truthfully.

This is a dense movie and worth another viewing at least.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Book 10/10 - Film 8/10,10/8/2019,Golligow,10-十二月-08,"I went to see this at an advanced screener in Leicester Square last night. Kate Winslett chatted about the film on stage afterward. I went as one of those people who'd read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I'd ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well, there's nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book, the locations, characters and scenes are all exactly as I 'saw' them on the page. Nothing (as far as I could tell) is portrayed out of order, no extra characters are introduced, and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100% perfect. The mies-en-scene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 10/10? The problem lies in the fact that Yates' novel is a literary one, much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don't think he really can, he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance, the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so (probably rightly) concerned about being true to the source material, the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience, a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that (interestingly) it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband, not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn't already told this story before, and by the final credits, I too was thinking just that, it felt like I'd watched a prequel to American Beauty, but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight. So, the book, 10/10, the film, 8/10.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Strong performances let down by weak narrative spine,10/7/2019,detectivedancing,1-三月-09,"Many people have said that Sam Mendes' latest forage into dark American suburbia in Revolutionary Road is how Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's characters from Titanic would be like had they have married in that film and Jack Dawson not met his effusive watery grave.

The film explores, from the very start, a broken relationship between the two brought on by banal life on the quiet Connecticut Revolutionary Road and both of them leaving behind the idealistic dreams of youth with DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler in an uninspiring sales job and Winslet's April Wheeler locked into the position of a housewife, briefly flirting with the world of theatre.

It is perhaps fitting that the opening scenes, culminating in a blazing row on an interstate roadside between the two, come after April feels she has failed in an amateur theatrical production. The movie feels like it has been adapted from a stage play rather than Richard Yates' novel with bulleted delineated locations and intense dialogue.

But it is the smouldering argumentative scenes between the Wheeler's that perhaps lead to a lack of fulfilment from the movie. While the feel is very Ingmar Bergman-esquire with gloomy and dark emotions bubbling under the surface, the movie does not portray the wider framework of the marriage strongly enough to carry these off.

The focal point of the film comes when April seizes on a former conversation between the two when Frank describes Paris in passionate terms, discussing his presence there in the World War II. In an attempt to reignite their lives, April suggests they set about moving to the European city so Frank can discover his true calling in life.

This provides an interesting pathway and allows the story to grow through the reactions of Frank's colleagues, a couple they're friends with, their former estate agent (Kathy Bates in her element as an interfering matriarch) and the Wheeler's two children.

It may come as a surprise that I had not referred to the children previously, especially as they fuel the destruction in Frank and April's marriage with Frank questioning whether April actually loves her children at all. The children themselves barely feature, merely used as plot tools to bring the narrative forward. This would not be such a problem but without any form of internal narration from either of them the sense of the true relationship between April and her kids is unclear and makes this aspect feel isolated.

The cold hard realities of the failing marriage are spotted by the estate agent's son, a mentally unstable man temporarily allowed out of an asylum, a notable performance from Michael Shannon, who frankly and with spite notices the hypocrisies and deterioration within the Wheelers romance.

The film uses set-pieces and the supporting cast to attempt to heighten the magnitude of admittedly bravely performed sequences between DiCaprio and Winslet, eventually reaching an engaging, though predictable, climax. While the movie is certainly not revolutionary in terms of its portrayal of a declining marriage (the television series Mad Men set in a similar suburban setting does this with much more care and intricacy), it is a solid piece of work from Mendes but cannot approach his seminal American Beauty. However, one is left longing for a greater insight into why and how the relationship has reached this point to provide much needed groundwork to the frequent marital disputes.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Winslet And Dicaprio Wage War With One Another Every Second of the Way Through,10/8/2019,alexkolokotronis,30-一月-09,"Without the great presence of Dicaprio and Winslet this film would seriously be at the level of a TV movie. Revolutionary Road is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is about a husband and wife who make an attempt at escaping there their ""empty and hopeless"" life. Or at least they create the delusion that they will.

In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the ""emptyness and hopelessness"" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.

The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded. Instead the movie becomes overly depressing and cynical not living up to its potential.",neg
Revolutionary Road,The American dream is actually a nightmare.,10/7/2019,Matt_Layden,2-五月-10,"A young couple living in 1950's suburbia think they are different from all the other families living the American Dream. Although, they soon find out that not every dream comes true and they fall exactly into the situations they didn't want to be in. Their marriage is falling apart, they have trouble raising their children and they want out of this lifestyle.

Sam Mendes is a filmmaker who knows exactly what he wants, which is why he would want to work on this film. Revolutionary Road is probably his least interesting film, story wise. After-all, it's just about two people who try to cope with their lives. There is no motivational plot to it, but the thing about this film is that it doesn't need one. We are getting a glimpse into the lives of two people who had big dreams and realized that they had to sacrifice them in order to live their lives. It's sad, but it also rings true.

The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the married couple who constantly fight. Everyone called this film the ""What If Jack and Rose Ended Up Together"" movie. Yet it is so much more than that. They give powerful performances, which unfortunately were overlooked during the Oscar season. Another Titanic star, Kathy Bates, gives her support to the couple as the real estate agent who thinks the world of them. She has a son, who is mentally unstable and asks to bring him over for dinner one night. Michael Shannon plays the son and he steals both scenes he is in. For a guy who is deemed insane, he is the only one who speaks the truth.

I watched this flick because so many people told me how depressing it was. While it was depressing I didn't find it to be that bad. The most depressing aspect of the film is how relatable it is to real life. This story happens everywhere and that is the sad part.

The cinematography is great, the 1950's feel was spot on and really gave the film more of a cinematic sense of wonder to it. Roger Deakins seems to know exactly what is needed for every film he takes on. The look and feel of the film here is so simple, yet so beautiful at the same time.

Finally, I can see why people may not like this film. It's definitely an acquired taste. I was not in love with it by any means and for those involved it's not their best work. Instead it's a film to enjoy once. I wouldn't bother watching it again because the pace is long and I feel that I won't be as engaged a second time.

On a final note, why do guys from the 1950's only last about 15 seconds?",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Nothing ""Revolutionary"" about this road.",10/6/2019,jfmvp,17-一月-09,"I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I walked out of the theater following ""Revolutionary Road."" My expectations were lofty because I loved what Sam Mendes did with ""American Beauty"" (10/10) and I was intrigued by ""Jarhead"" (7/10) as well. Of course the preliminary bar was set high for a film featuring both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

And yet, I was underwhelmed by the final product that was ""Revolutionary Road."" No, this wasn't a clichéd case of setting the bar TOO high, because I always keep my pregame expectations in check. They're there, but I don't allow them to cloud my judgment.

Mendes was fine; his mise en scene was a bit mundane and predictable, yet still mostly effective. I would like to have searched for more subtlety when dealing with a director of Mendes' caliber, but it just wasn't there this time. Only shot that jumps out at me is the one of the sprinkler spout metaphorically separating April Wheeler from her family.

As for the performances, I felt that Winslet slightly outperformed Leo. Not that that's especially relevant, because neither performance was award-worthy. I'm shocked that Winslet could take home two Golden Globes in one year, when one of those Globes was awarded for her work in this film. She was good, but not outstanding.

I must tread carefully, though, because I shouldn't blame Winslet or DiCaprio for the shortcomings of the script. On the whole, the dialogue was absolutely painful -- nothing original came for seemingly endless sets of time. I'm aware that the screenplay was adapted from a novel, so perhaps the faults lie in the novel itself. Yet, that's not what I'm hearing from those who read and loved the book.

I was intrigued by the general concept of the film, because we all struggle with the internal conflict of our dreams vs. reality, and many of us struggle with the comfortable suburbia vs. monotonous suburbia conflict as well. But ""Revolutionary Road"" was overkill in both arenas. Just too much of the same throughout: calm before the storm, match, lit match, explosion. Calm before the storm, match, lit match, explosion.

Much of the repetition may have been intentional, but it simply wasn't effective. How Roger Ebert gave ""Revolutionary Road"" four stars out of four, absolutely boggles my mind.

This film is a 6/10, at best. If you love great cinema, you will be disappointed. ""Revolutionary Road"" is a level below.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Eagerly Awaiting the DVD release (it's THAT good)!!!!,10/10/2019,RechRo,5-十二月-08,"Just saw this movie. All I can say is: Wow! In this Richard Yates story portrayed through the lens of Mr. Mendes' camera, we enter the relationship of Frank and April Wheeler; a young married couple depicted brilliantly by DiCaprio and Winslet, who seem to be on the verge of marital and emotional collapse as their growing desperation and dissatisfaction with their town and their relationship leads them to think of an escape. There are some compelling, memorable, emotionally gripping scenes between DiCaprio and Winslet, which should interest acting students who wish to know what it means to be ""in the moment"". Additionally, there is the immensely talented Kathy Bates, whose humorous scenes balance out the heavily dramatic ones nicely and which are sure to leave a warm spot on your heart. Also adding humor to the movie is Michael Shannon as Bates' psychologically unstable son, who steals just about every scene he's in. There are moments where the dialogue can seem to feel cliché, but with everything else working so well, those moments can be forgiven. This is a film not to be missed. I've become a greater admirer of DiCaprio's acting ability as a result of this film, Winslet never disappoints, and Mendes adds another superb credit to his resume with this amazing film.

Revolutionary Road,Leo and Kate's world of pure suffering.,10/5/2019,AngelDel,14-五月-10,"One of the reasons I keep devouring stories in general, and films in particular is that I firmly believe that the authors always have something to say, something worth being heard. A powerful message, if you may, about their view of life. A revelation to present the audience with, so we can leave the room with that ""wow, life is just like that"" feeling.

This message may be positive or negative, but it should always be believable within the reality of the film. I confess I rather prefer a positive one. Or, if negative, at least with a tiny bit of hope hidden somewhere, I rather not leave the room feeling miserable. But I understand some audiences may enjoy this and, in any case, it doesn't matter: it's your message, isn't it?

According to Justin Haythe (writer) and Sam Mendes (director), life is just too painful to be lived, too full of suffering and sorrow as to find the time to enjoy, create or love. We are hit with a most melodramatic picture of everyday events in a script that fails to create actual conflicts and believable drama. In such a farce, the luxury of the intense performances given by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are outrageously wasted.

Fans of the actors will undoubtedly enjoy it, of course, and such an effort certainly deserves recognition. But the story itself contributes nothing, neither to the film history wealth, nor to the poor audience's expectations, that are likely to feel rather down after the show, or even mad at the whole world for no apparent reason, just like the protagonist couple.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"Another matchup, another great movie",10/10/2019,gsedlik,6-十二月-08,"I just saw an advanced screening of this movie at the DGA theater by Carnegie Hall. Ever since I heard that DiCaprio and Winslet were teaming up again, I had to go see it. After waiting a half an hour outside of the theater in the freezing weather, I was thinking to myself, ""this movie better be good"".

I was not the slightest bit disappointed, and I was extremely happy walking out of that theater. If there is one person I must applaud, it's the casting director, because every person in that movie really got into character, and not one person was out of line. DiCaprio and Winslet's chemistry was once again flawless, I honestly felt like I was watching a 50's suburban couple fighting about normal, every day problems, no scripts. All of the supporting cast was superb, especially Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon, who should both be very tough contenders to beat for the best actress and best supporting actor Oscars, respectively.

Thank you, Sam Mendes, for giving the American people another great drama to watch, that really gave people a dose of what the ""perfect 50's suburban life"", was really like.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"A dreadful parody of ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit""",10/1/2019,alrodbel,1-二月-09,"The art of storytelling, whether in a play, a novel or a film is to create characters who become real. And once you identify with the characters, their lives become the vehicle for the tone and message of the work. Without such realism, such verisimilitude, there is nothing but parody, and the manipulation of stock figures.

I am a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, so I was looking forward to seeing them in a serious exploration of an era that I lived through as a young man. This work was stunningly without substance. Oh there were emotions, but the characters were not believable, and worse there was no attempt to make it so. The clue is the two children, throw away place holders, so they never even became people. Yet children are a part of any family, and we can't know the family without knowing the joys and trials of these most vulnerable members.

A good test that I use of the quality of any film is whether there are throwaway characters, or if every person seems to have walked in from their own full life. If they only utter a single line, you can still tell. The mental patient visitor was some kind of a joke I imagine. Not like anyone with schizophrenia that I ever met, and I met a few.

And it's not trivial that Frank could never describe exactly what he did for a living. The writers never bothered to create an occupation that would have fit the plot. So he was just a man in a cubicle. A nobody, with no interest in his work, but who was made a key member of a team to develop the most complex product of the era, who had no idea what it did, or how it worked.

Some may consider this transcending details to provide a cultural everyman. But everyman is no man at all.

This wasn't a dysfunctional marriage, as that implies that there is first a marriage. The film ""The Squid and the Whale"" was about a dysfunctional marriage, where the couple were at each others throats Yet both of them and their children were real unique struggling humans trapped in their history and that of their circle. That was a true work of art, while this was an exercise in a drama class.

For those who think this is some accurate depiction of America in the 1950s, believe me it isn't. If you want to see a film about a dysfunctional couple of the era, try ""Come back little Sheba"" or ""Death of a Salesman."" Each of these films created actual characters, and we were drawn into their lives as we learned about the era.

This film was about 2008, and how when two super stars are signed for a film deal there is no need to throw away money on writers who flesh out their characters, and provide plausible circumstances of their lives.

I just learned that the director of this film was the same man who directed, ""American Beauty,"" one of my all time favorites.

Go figure!",neg
Revolutionary Road,One of the WORST Films of 2008,10/1/2019,JaysonT,2-一月-09,"Wow I am shocked at how bad this film was! It was a boring, pointless 2 hour pain that I am surprised has gotten so many great reviews. I think many posters on here miss the point when people like me complain about the movie. I thought Winslet was okay, but seemed mannered and annoying. DiCaprio was just flat out annoying in this. He sounded like a 15 year-old boy at his first high school play. Both actors seemed, again, far too young to be playing these characters. The film lacks story arc, structure, and most importantly...CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! One of the first things they teach you in film school (Mr. Mendes) is that you need to have CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT to make your audience care about what's happening to the people on screen. This movie opens up with Kate and Leo fighting. We don't care about the fight, however, because we don't know who the hell these people are. As the movie progresses, we still don't see anything hint about who these people are. He works at a boring job. She's a housewife. Gee, like we never have seen one of these stories be told before. And then- nothing happens! There's no plot! The movie is an excuse for Winslet and DiCaprio to have yelling matches together. It's like watching a VH1 reality show shot in 35mm. What's more, we don't feel or care about the characters. When ever Winslet cried, I cringed. It's being touted as one of her best performances? Really? I thought it was mannered, controlled and whiny. She's done billions times better then this stuff. And DiCaprio is just flat-out BAD. Perhaps I would think they did better jobs if I cared at all about the movie's premise. On top of this, the film is morbidly predictable, and cliché. (SPOILER!) When Kate is ""Upset"" one morning, and having a fit in the kitchen, Leo asks her what's wrong. It's so blatantly obvious she's pregnant, and having ""Morning Cramps"". And then of course, she says she wants an abortion. I knew what was going to happen before it did. Mendes, a master of storytelling with American BEAUTY and ROAD TO PERDITION, fails so low here I almost feel bad for him. Every shot of this movie looks like its designed for Academy Awards in the Art Direction and Cinematography department. But there's no substance at all to the storytelling. Every shot is a silhouette or closeup of boring dramatic angles that mean nothing other then to have dumb audiences go ""Oooo, now that's a great camera angle."" If this movie gets nominations from the Oscars (which it will), I will know its because those voters haven't seen the movie yet, and are voting for it on name bases alone. FINAL GRADE: F",neg
Revolutionary Road,Breath-taking and emotionally gripping film,10/10/2019,porazzim42,5-二月-09,"This was flat-out, out of the best movies I've ever seen. But I have been reading some comments about this movie and I want to clear some things up.

April is NOT selfish! She really loves Frank and would do anything to make him happy. She and him and both miserable in suburbia and she knows that Frank hates the job he works at. So she suggests that they go away. She only says Paris because she knows it's one of the only places he's ever been to that makes him feel ""alive"". She wants him to find a job that makes him happy. In fact, I firmly believe that if he told her he wanted to be a flamingo dancer, she would buy him the suit and let him do the can-can all over the house if it made him happy.

When he accepts her offer to got to Paris, she feels that everything will be perfect. But then she hears him on the beach telling someone else about the job offer. She is crushed, not only because she was the last to know, but because it was like he was stomping on her dream of happiness for the family.

She decides then that she's done...that she just can't handle it anymore. She is tired of living a lie that she is happy when she knows full-well that she isn't. She loves him but frankly, marriage and kids is draining the life out of her. I think when she heard what she heard on the beach and Frank said, ""Why don't you let that be my business,"" or whatever he said, he was basically telling her it was his life and to stay out of it.

That's why the whole fight in the woods scene happened...she had made up her mind. She wanted out. You may not agree with her decision, but I can definitely understand it.

And Frank is not a bad man. Yes, I am aware that he cheated on April. But so did she. He's the type of man that needs to be loved and appreciated. I think he felt he wasn't getting that with April. He loves her and cares about her but she's a lot for him to handle. Especially in the opening scene when they get into a fight about the play. He can see that she is hurting that it bombed and he wants to make her feel better. But he doesn't know what to say and whatever he says, is wrong to April because she's already in a terrible mood. And you know men...they mean well but sometimes they are totally clueless.

And he felt awful about cheating. Did you see the close-up when April and the kids sang happy birthday to him. He felt like the biggest jerk!

The acting was amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was unbelievable as Frank. In the scene where April tells him she hates him and he cries, it ripped me apart inside. I don't know...something about men crying bothers me. Kate was wonderful as usual. I hope she wins that Oscar. The best thing about this movie was that DiCaprio and Winslet could speak volumes without saying a single word. It was all in their eyes.

Sam Mendes is a genius! Anyway, I think I'm rambling now so I'll leave you to decide for yourself what you think of this movie. I, as you can see, fully enjoyed it.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Utterly dreadful,10/1/2019,tructus-1,6-八月-09,"Abotu 20 min. into ""Revolutionary Road,"" my husband said ""all three main characters were in 'Titanic."" I replied, ""I think this movie is sinking faster.""

The '50s are certainly a treasure trove of depression, conformity and hidden angst. No surprise there. And depressing subject matter, if handled honestly, can still be cathartic and uplifting even if there's no ""happy ending."" But really...

The heavy-handed script is like ""Human Angst For Dummies."" The characters are one-dimensional in their suffering, and the screenwriter has left nothing to the imagination. The script provides no interesting little moments, surprising details, intriguing contradictions or sharply observed behavior. Nothing is implied, nothing simmers beneath the surface.

The first argument scene, particularly DeCaprio's performance, is right out of bad community theater. I've seldom seen such embarrassing scenery-chewing in a ""major"" movie. (Kate Winslet manages to escape mostly unscathed, but she seems to be just walking through this one.) And I'm getting REALLY tired of Kathy Bates doing her Kathy Bates Thing.

Ugh.

The sets, costumes, etc. are all lovely and perfect. But any episode of ""Mad Men"" provides all the same surface polish, plus some some actual delving into the human condition. I turned it off after 20 minutes.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Completely and Utterly Overrated,10/1/2019,alhodonai,14-一月-09,"I remember when I first saw articles about this movie. It seemed interesting enough; Kate Winslet is a good actor if not someone I particularly enjoy, Leonardo DiCaprio is usually excellent, and I loved American Beauty. The preview made it seem perfectly interesting enough, so I wasn't too disappointed when broken plans for the night lead to a group viewing of Revolutionary Road.

Until I saw it.

My God, it was absolutely terrible. Good acting (GOOD acting, not great) can't save a terrible film, and this was, in fact, a God awful experience. It was slow, it was overdone, there was no point to any of if it, literally no one in the movie was attractive save DiCaprio, etc, etc. The score consisted of three ominous chords repeated over and over again. Nothing. Happened. Quickly. Enough. It went: ""Long pause, stare, change expression slightly, stare."" Much too long a movie for far too little story. The point could've been conveyed less irritatingly if it had been presented quicker. It got to the point where, during what one could perhaps consider the climax of the movie (where DiCaprio slams a chair against the wall, Winslet lets out an ""AHHHHHH!"" at a touch on the shoulder, DiCaprio screams profanity before Winslet decides to walk into the woods, where DiCaprio proceeds to CHASE HER THROUGH THE WOODS), we were all laughing hysterically at it. It wasn't just my group of friends either, others were equally amused.

Point of the matter: Don't see this film. It's terrible. You won't enjoy it unless you like crap. Just... don't. Please.

The only positive thing about this film was the drinking game we would play if we could stomach seeing the damn thing again: take a shot every time they light a cigarette. That way, you won't make it through the first half conscious.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Must be missing something,10/2/2019,tunnelboy,3-七月-09,"I watched this with my wife after our local newspaper gave it their best rating. We knew from the storyline that it was not going to be a ""feel good"" movie. But I didn't realize it was going to be like watching paint dry.

First of all the movie has NO PLOT whatsoever. Nothing happens except shouting back and forth. The acting seemed very good. But as someone that doesn't know anything about the actor profession, I'd take a guess that this kind of acting... 2 hours of rage... would probably be the easiest. Just yelling and screaming as hard as you can, staring out the window, and tearing up. That's it! Aside from that, a few things happen in the movie that have no point whatsoever. What was the point of the office affair? Why spend 20 minutes on that and not have it go anywhere or mean anything? What about their friend's husband who professed love? What did it mean? Why? What was that point? What about the mentally challenged guy? Where did that come from, and how does that have anything to do with anything? I don't doubt that so many people enjoyed this movie. Everyone is different. But it leaves me confused on what it is that people saw so interesting in it. I feel like it was a 2 disc set and we forgot to play disc 2.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Awful movie that made me depressed,10/1/2019,britonebay,4-二月-09,"From beginning to end this movie was full of the following things: Smoking, Drinking, swearing, deception, depression, unhappiness, fighting, yelling, unfaithful sex, and hate. Then at the end the main female character gives herself an abortion in her own bathroom and dies. If your crazy enough to think this sounds appealing then this movie is for you, otherwise don't waste your time or give your money to this crap. I am amazed people actually enjoy this type of movie. The only good thing I took from this movie is how great my life actually is. This movie does remind me of why chasing worldly desires will lead to an unhappy life.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Depressing,10/3/2019,derbridge,8-三月-19,"Very little in this movie that will cheer you up. Mostly very depressing view of life.

The couple has 2 children, you hardly ever see. The husband has a meaningless job he hates. The wife is bored out of her mind with housework and no career or future for her.

Sorry. But this movie is very negative about life and very depressing to watch.

Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road A Tragic Realistic Love Story,10/8/2019,tburke85,8-六月-09,"Revolutionary Road is a tragic realistic love story powered by the believable performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who reunite 12 years later after starring in 1997's Titanic together. They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Everything This Movie Has to Say Has Been Said Before and Said Better,10/5/2019,evanston_dad,14-一月-09,"The subject of suburban misery and malaise, and the myth of the American dream, has been dealt with so frequently in movies, television and literature that you may wonder what more there is to say about the topic. If ""Revolutionary Road"" is any example, the answer is: not much. Indeed, the whole time I was watching this strangely insubstantial film from director Sam Mendes, the only thing I could think of were all the other movies I've seen that have dealt with the same themes and dealt with them better.

Frank and April Wheeler are the miserably married couple at the center of this story. Frank, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes off to work in a featureless anthill of a company, diddling the occasional office girl on the side. April stays home and frets over the acting career that never materialized for her and rebelling against the stifling sameness of suburbia that she feels she's better than. Most of the film consists of monotonous scenes of these two screaming at each other. I guess it's meant to be a sort of modern-day ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", the story of a married couple who could be helping one another but instead decide to tear each other apart, except that the material isn't nearly as interesting as Edward Albee's play, and neither are the characters.

For ""Revolutionary Road"" to work, we have to really understand why April is so unhappy, and that's something the film doesn't tell us. Kate Winselt tries awfully hard, but she can't make much of this rather unlikable character. She didn't have my sympathy because I never understood her problem. I understand suburban unhappiness in general, but I didn't understand it as presented here. DiCaprio has the easier time of it, because Frank it turns out isn't all that unhappy with his life, and pretends to be so largely for April's benefit. The film doesn't establish much about these two before they met or about the early days of their marriage. We're supposed to feel emotions about them in a vacuum without any context. I didn't feel anything.

There's not much relief from DiCaprio and Winslet, as one or the other is in virtually every frame of the movie. There are a couple of recognizable actors in supporting roles, namely Kathy Bates as a real estate agent friend and Michael Shannon as her bonkers son. This character is wedged awkwardly into the narrative as the movie's id, shouting out truths everyone else is trying to avoid having to admit, but Shannon's performance is over the top and I didn't know what I was supposed to make of him.

With wonderful films like ""Far from Heaven,"" ""The Hours,"" ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Little Children"" (which stars Winslet in a stunning turn, no less) and the cable series ""Mad Men"" exploring the same themes as ""Revolutionary Road"" but much more capably, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this gloomy, depressing movie that has nothing to say. It's not an awful movie, but at the same time it has very little to recommend it.

Grade: C",neg
Revolutionary Road,Thoroughly Unpleasant From Start To Finish,10/2/2019,sddavis63,12-四月-09,"As I suspect many people were, I was drawn to this movie primarily out of curiosity, wanting to see the ""great reunion"" - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet reunited 11 years after their blockbuster starring turns in ""Titanic"" - with Kathy Bates thrown into the mix as well. There's no doubt that DiCaprio and Winslet have some powerful scenes together, but this movie is about as far removed from ""Titanic"" as any movie could possibly be. In this movie set in the 50's, they play the Wheelers - Frank and April - a young couple trying to make their way in the world, dissatisfied with life, with marriage, with each other and with pretty much everything else. They hatch a scheme for Frank to quit a job he hates to allow the family to move to Paris to let him ""discover"" himself while she supports them. Things seem to improve for a while, but the plan falls apart, and eventually so does everything else in their lives. The Wheelers are not a pleasant couple to watch or listen to, and, by the end of the movie, pretty much everybody else is sending the message ""I don't want to talk about the Wheelers any more."" They do have those handful of powerful, raw with (negative) emotion scenes, but in the absence of that anger (which sometimes seemed to border on hatred) Frank and April are actually pretty dry together, which might make a valid point about the state of their marriage, but which isn't very interesting to watch. In the end, I just found them to be unpleasant characters in an unpleasant movie. This certainly isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. 2/10",neg
Revolutionary Road,"No wonder no one says ""swell"" anymore!",10/10/2019,Anonymous_Maxine,5-三月-09,"My grandparents still consider the 1950's to be the golden age of pure, unblemished Americanism. A time when teenagers were respectful, parents were bright, smiling examples of friendly authority, sex was post-marital and marriage was a time of apple pies and cheerful strolls down the charming neighborhood lane. I don't know at the moment if my grandparents have seen Revolutionary Road, but rarely do movies come along when the opinions of our elders would almost surely prove to be enormously valuable and insightful.

The movie is based on the novel by Richard Yates, which attacked the very normality and pleasant conformity of the 1950's that forms the basis of so much of the modern nostalgia about it today. There has been a lot of expectation about the movie that would bring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together again for the first time in more than a decade, but the romance that they share in Revolutionary Road could not possibly be more different from the one they developed on the Titanic.

They are Frank and April Wheeler, an outwardly charming husband and wife who live in a beautiful dream house on Revolutionary Road. They radiate an atmosphere of perfection and happiness and are loved by the neighbors. We meet them just after they've made what they promised each other was only a temporary move from Manhattan to the sprawling suburbs. The movie begins with April in an unsuccessful play, and we learn very quickly about their relationship in the car on the way home as Frank thoughtfully assures her that it's okay that she didn't become an actress, it's not her fault that the play was lousy, and then in the fight that ensues, Frank tells her that she acts ""sick"" when she gets mad like this.

It seems that the most important thing that Frank and April embody about the traditional 1950s couple was the routine sacrificing of dreams upon the altar of conformity and fulfilling expectations. April dreams of a romantic life in Paris, and Frank has artistic ambitions as well. But he is stuck in a job that he hates despite a good salary, they have two kids already and a third accidentally on the way, and adultery's going on left and right.

April suggests that they drop everything and move to Paris where, with money that she could make working combined with whatever they could get for the house, they could live comfortably until he could get on his feet artistically and they could both live the lives they have always dreamed of. They are doing what is expected of them already, but they're both deeply unhappy and they see no improvement ahead.

It is one of the movie's more successful tragic moments in the way that everyone Frank and April know react to the news that they are moving. Responses range from friendly disbelief to outward remarks of irresponsibility and suggestions that such a move would be ""irresponsible."" It's hard to watch Frank and April let go of their dreams when it was right in their grasp.

It's not unrealistic, ladies and gentlemen. It's uncommon and unexpected, but unrealistic? Irresponsible? I should hope not! It's commonly believed to be irresponsible and unrealistic, but it's not, trust me. I'm doing it myself. I left a job in Los Angeles two years ago that paid well but that I didn't like, and I've been living in China (decidedly less romantic than Paris, I admit) ever since. I now have a job that pays less than I made in LA, but my lifestyle is much more comfortable and I work 10 hours a week, which leaves me time to pursue my artistic endeavors. See how that works?

Granted, I don't have any kids, but I also didn't have a house to sell to put together some money to support myself while I found work. ""I just think people are better off doing some kind of work that they actually like,"" Frank complains. I tend to agree.

But ultimately life gets in the way, as they say. A gossipy real estate agent, played perfectly by Kathy Bates, makes friends with April and nervously asks if she might bring over her son John, who has been in a mental institution and who she thinks might benefit from meeting a happy couple like April and Frank. April agrees, but when John comes over, it seems that his only mental problem is an inability to adhere to accepted models of conformity, which manifests itself mostly in the form of cutting through other peoples' facades like warm butter and laying bare the sad, bitter reality of their lives. When he does this with April and Frank, the results are not pretty, but they are some of the best movie moments of 2008.

Kate and Leo both approach perfection in their performances. Both of them have appeared in other brilliant films in 2008 (Kate in The Reader and Leo in Body of Lies), but in Revolutionary Road their performances reach such a level of pitch and depth that, when combined, they reverberate against each other and turn into something entirely different. If there were an Oscar for the best combination of two performances, there would be no need for any other nominees.

Revolutionary Road is not the most uplifting film of the year (although it's also not nearly as depressing as, say, Rachel Getting Married), but it is definitely among the most important. It's not so much that the movie attacks conformity, but that it attacks that little voice inside us that prevents us from doing what we really want in life because it goes against the accepted norm. Watching the movie kind of takes a bite out of you, but it takes a bite of that part of you that gets in the way of your dreams.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Absolutely dreadful,10/2/2019,lomius,10-五月-09,"I really wanted to like this movie. Felt like a great take on the Broken American Dream. Instead however, I felt like killing myself at the end. Sure these people both felt stuck but seriously... Maybe I am just a stronger person. I have been there and was able to pull myself out of a rut and am better for it. However, these 2... I don't know it just seemed terribly depressing and wrong. There were so many ways they could have fixed their situation. But it is hard to feel sorry for them. They had a wonderful house, wonderful family, and sure they may have been a bit hindered by the children. But my God. I really wish they would have been poor, uneducated, and maybe even some type of refugees. Then I could have perhaps seen a bit of reason to feel sorry. Towards the middle I was hoping they would shoot each other. Terrible movie. I hope the book was better. Don't get me wrong. I don't need the happy ending to a movie. I actually like the spin when there is a bad ending. But in the end it was just a bad movie ending worse.

Revolutionary Road,Depressing. A waste of time and money,10/1/2019,Sweetcorn33,9-二月-09,"Wow what a bad movie. We went into this movie with very high hopes and it was a total bomb. Complete waste of money. It was nothing but arguing, adultery, smoking, drinking, fighting....ugh...and all between a housewife and a working husband in the 50s/60s.

This movie could have easily turned around in the ended on a positive note with the trip to Paris, but no. It ended with death and tears and questions still remaining.

Leonardo and Kate worked well together. They are great actors ...but...the plot and the story line in this movie was slow, depressing, and not worth the time or money.

Revolutionary Road,Most of us live on Revolutionary Road,10/3/2019,imxo,14-三月-09,"I could watch the wonderful Kate Winslett read a cook book aloud and not be bored, but what's the purpose of this film? I would imagine 7 out of 10 Americans live in one way or another on their own version of Revolutionary Road. When there's no particular struggle to obtain food or shelter one is left pondering the meaning of life and why one is so dissatisfied with one's lot. It's the middle class curse.

There is nothing special about this film or, I expect, the book on which it is based. For many, the American Dream is just a long, dull, pointless exercise on a treadmill while waiting for the inevitable. What's the point of seeing it played out in a film? Does the filmmaker think we're not aware of all this?

Revolutionary Road,"Utter, utter, utter tosh. And pretentious with it.",10/1/2019,wtyrrell,3-二月-09,"Really bad film. The only good things about it were the costumes and set - everything else was false, false, false. Couldn't have cared less about all of the characters because Sam Mendes couldn't be bothered to explain them to us or develop them in any way. Couldn't take them seriously as a couple because they were so mismatched - Leo DiCaprio will always be a pudgy teenager to me, so couldn't take him seriously as an early middle-life crisis type. Kate Winslett? Well normally she at least looks good, but she was haggard in this. Just what was all the hype about? I really think that Golden Globes must be ten a penny if she actually won one for this. No wonder she was speechless - she probably couldn't believe that this performance had won it for her. Will be very careful in future about any more Sam Mendes films I see.

Revolutionary Road,The hopeless emptiness,10/4/2019,hall895,4-二月-11,"At one point in this film the key characters, in discussing their own lives, mention the ""hopeless emptiness"" of it all. And thus in one line of dialogue is the entire movie summed up rather neatly. Empty for sure and bordering on hopeless Revolutionary Road is pretty much an all-around failure. It's a movie about an unhappy 1950s suburban couple who feel trapped in their own little world. They're disappointed in their lives and harbor fanciful notions of somehow getting away from it all. They're suburban nobodies who want to be somebodies. If the audience could say anything to this screen couple it would probably be ""get over yourselves"".

Revolutionary Road is one of those movies which goes out of its way to thoroughly depress you. That's fine but if it insists on depressing you is it too much to ask that it entertains you somewhere along the way too? No such luck with this movie. Entertainment value is practically nil, nothing interesting ever seems to happen. Frank and April Wheeler are unhappy. They fight, fight some more, make up for a bit, fight some more and bemoan how miserable their lives have turned out to be. This goes on and on for two hours as the audience tries to stifle yawns. Frank and April are terrible bores. Their friends and neighbors are bores. One of their friends has a rather insane son who pops in a couple of times to inject some personality and life into the movie. Michael Shannon plays that part and makes a better impression than any of the big stars do. At least his character does some memorable things. But his scenes are all too fleeting. All too soon we're back to Frank and April throwing fits about the terrible state of their lives. Which rings rather hollow when you consider 99 percent of the world's population would kill to have the ""boring"", ""hopeless"", ""empty"" lives the Wheelers so detest. They have it pretty darned good but they've deluded themselves into thinking they deserve better. They don't. Their lives are just fine. Hopeless? Empty? Really, get over yourselves. Please.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both fine performers and they make the best they can out of this mess. The performances aren't the problem, the story is. And the characters. Never for a moment do we sympathize with Frank and April and that right there would be enough to doom the movie to failure. Who can identify with these people? Who would want to? DiCaprio and Winslet took on rather thankless roles in portraying this couple. With all the bickering and fighting there is an opportunity for the stars to go somewhat over the top at times and engage in a bit of scenery-chewing. But aside from that you really wouldn't criticize them. The stars don't let down the movie, the movie lets down its stars. There is so little for them to work with. The story is not engaging at all. It's a dull, boring movie in which very little of consequence ever happens. As such maybe it does capture all that emptiness the characters feel in their lives. But it makes for an empty movie.",neg

Revolutionary Road,Wheeler Family Values,10/7/2019,bkoganbing,2-九月-11,"The Titanic lovers, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, get reunited for Revolutionary Road a tale of sterile life in the suburbs during the Eisenhower years. Not that this is anything new, the subject was done as comedy and as drama in such diverse films way back then as Rally Round The Flag Boys and Strangers When We Meet.

It's a nice story, but not one I could terribly worked up about. So Leonardo is working for some firm as a sales rep and it's a job he hates. Good for him, 90% of the American work force are in jobs that are just paychecks to support themselves and their families. Which Leo and Kate increased by two during the course of the film.

Seeing themselves in a rut, Kate lets fly the brilliant suggestion that he just quit and move to Paris. Not only that he should just 'find himself' and she'll work and support and raise the kids and him. Leo likes the idea, but then gets cold feet and it goes downhill from there.

Leo and Kate are fine, but the film just is not up to the standards set by Titanic. I sure cared a lot more about Jack and Rose than I did about either of the Wheelers. Nevertheless Revolutionary Road which is the name of the street the Wheelers live on in the film, got three Oscar nominations including one for Michael Shannon as the bipolar son of the Wheeler's neighbor Kathy Bates who sold them the house. Nowadays Shannon would be on his meds and leading a more productive life than he is here. Shannon lost for Best Supporting Actor to Heath Ledger for the Dark Knight.

Revolutionary Road is entertaining, but hardly groundbreaking.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Boring & Pointless!,10/1/2019,doudzy-1,5-三月-09,"I haven't read the book but I'm assuming that the book is way better than the movie for it to be made into one. A lot of times novels fail to make a good movie and this one is one of them.

Maybe if the movie were a true story, I would have appreciated it and felt the message it's trying to convey but this movie is just unrealistic and pointless. It's sad that DiCaprio and Winslet accepted a script like that.

Moreover, the movie is slow and gets you bored. The whole time I kept convincing myself that it will lead to a really good part which will make the story useful and interesting in the end.

Revolutionary Road,Yawn...,10/5/2019,bryanhelder,13-三月-09,"Great acting, boring movie. This story is familiar to a lot of people cause it's about a couple and the things couples deal with. It's not really that interesting, especially 2 hours of it. The pace of this movie is so slow, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. These types of movies are overrated because of the big names in them, and if two no names gave the same performances, I doubt so many people would love it so much. Lots of people will say how great it was, but only because they wouldn't dare to say that Leo was in a bad movie. Obviously mostly everyone here would disagree with me, cause you apparently love movies where nothing happens. Revolutionary road is more like the highways in Saskatchewan, not a whole lot to see, and it's pretty straight forward.

Revolutionary Road,Eyes that cannot see...,10/1/2019,sitabanu,13-六月-11,"It would seem this couple lived in the backwoods of Appalachia rather than the Connecticut suburbs of New York City. New York City in the 1950's was hardly a period of dearth of intellectual, artistic, political and social change. The movie requires the audience to suspend time and actually believe April was so close-minded she could not get a driver's license or take the railroad into The City - The Big Apple ! Man. However, we are expected to believe she was itching to blaze trails and live the good life in beautiful Paris! Hey, there is a really apt expression that fits her situation : ""Where ever you go there you are."" She was infantile, narcissistic, and worse a coward. I would have had more respect for her had she simply gotten on the plane and sent him a letter with a picture of her standing in the Louvre Museum or sitting at an open air café drinking a glass of milk! It occurred to me that in ""Titanic"" - DiCaprio died and here Winslet does. Perhaps in their next movie together they can die together or couple in a modern version of ""Dead Again"" made by Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh - this might work out the bad karma at long last - breaking the energy of star-crossed lovers who happen to be Libra (Winslet) and Scorpio (DiCaprio). LOL.

It is safe to say I did not ""like"" the movie.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Book 10/10 movie 10/10,10/10/2019,stephp-3,1-一月-09,"This movie was so amazing in every way possible, i really cant think of anything that annoyed me with it. I read the book about a week before i saw it, and the book was amazing as well as this amazing movie. If you have never seen it yet don't read some of these bad comments, this is the best movie of 2008. If you read the book you enjoy it so much more and really know how good DiCaprio and winslet were in it. they were the Wheelers, Leo in particular was simple perfect. if he doesn't finally win this year i don't know what else he has to do to prove he deserves an Oscar.

so overall 10/10 best movie of 2008 amazingly directed and acted and everything else.

Revolutionary Road,Terrible,10/1/2019,john-brocato,18-七月-09,"This movie is terrible. It tries to make grand statements about the hopelessness of cookie- cutter suburbia and attempts to provide insightful character studies, but it fails miserably on both counts. The dialogue is particularly bad; as brilliant as Kate and Leo can be, they sound like cut-rate community theatre actors. The flashbacks and flashforwards are poorly handled and not only add nothing to the story but also detract from it. The pacing is way off, the score is a nuisance, and the subplot (such as it is) of the secretarial other woman almost seems poorly edited, as if the initial scenes were forgotten until the creators needed another bump in an overly flat narrative road. The only meritorious part of this movie is the character of John, the institutionalized neighbor son. His role is creepy and thankfully less monotone than the rest, but even this is not nearly reason enough to put up with the remaining mediocrity. Don't forfeit two hours of your life for this film.

Revolutionary Road,The road already traveled,10/6/2019,doctorsmoothlove,27-一月-09,"It's been a decade since Sam Mendes' debut picture American Beauty. That's a really long time for the movie-going public. People forget a film's uniqueness and directors repackage old material into a new movie, to the dismay of us film reviewers. Benjamin Button did that to Forest Gump, and Mendes has done it with his newest work. I'm not bold enough to make the claim that he simply re-released American Beauty as Revolutionary Road but the two are very similar. That's OK since American Beauty won several awards in various countries. It's still a worth a ticket price, but people will forget about this film in five years as American Beauty resurfaces in their minds.

The film is adapted from Richard Yates' extremely well-received novel, first published in 1961. It is an examination of American suburbia that blossomed in the '50s and the problems therein. Now, I think that such an observation would be especially meaningful when made in its own time but not as much now. Many other people, including Mendes himself, have already produced Revolutionary Road in both film and other media. This forces the movie to rely on something additional besides its tired premise. Revolutionary Road offers viewers a disturbingly lifelike representation of a failing marriage. Winslet and DiCaprio are so good that I found myself turning away frequently. After their characters marry and become parents, both actors are constantly uneasy. Neither portrayal is subdued. Even when they are not verbally abusing each other, both are under veils of artificial emotion. There are no feel-good elements to the picture. Revolutionary Road is as effective as any gruesome exploitative film in never allowing its audience a moment's respite. It's different from American Beauty in that distinct way. The film is pessimistic while its parent is inspiring.

Unlike American Beauty, the wife character is the one who envisions herself in a situation more grandiose. Winslet plays April, a former stage actress, who meets Frank Wheeler at a party and eventually marries him. They settle at ""Revolutionary Road"" suburb and raise a family. April suggests that Frank quit his office job and pursue his dream of moving to France. She even agrees to work while he determines his real interest. Things seem to be working until Frank receives a promotion which he accepts. Verbal violence ensues and April reveals that she is pregnant with the family's third child. Frank demands that she not abort the child, but secretly wishes that she would. She does it herself and dies of blood loss.

Mendes still has not analyzed the suburban problem in a sophisticated way. His newest film is stuffed with lazy and obvious symbolism that has no conclusion. April is unhappy, Frank is too comfortable to care if he's happy, and the audience wonders what these people would do if they actually went to France. It sounds like they would live the same boring life they had in America but in a foreign country. OK, I'll let Mendes slide on that one. Not on this one. April's death is tragic because it leaves the film unfinished. Death is the solution to obstacles we cannot overcome. We are condemned to live in a world over which we have no control and are resigned to suffer eternally. Revolutionary Road understands that statement but doesn't recognize human willpower. April says she doesn't love Frank, so why doesn't she just leave? There is no indication that she loves her children either so she has no excuse.

I'm going to do something unusual with this review. I'll give it three stars but not a recommendation. It's cool seeing Winslet and DiCaprio reunited in the antithesis of Titanic. Let's hope Mendes doesn't develop his sensei's (Tim Burton) knack for recycling characters and themes in his next project.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"More Hollywood liberal claptrap about women ""oppressed"" by family",10/1/2019,Der_Schnibbler,3-八月-09,"The movie, in a few words, goes like this: young couple meet, get married, move to a nice house in suburbia. Uh-oh, warning bells are going off already, for we all already know suburbia is the place where civilized people live, and civilized people don't like degenerate American mainstream society, so of course they are evil, mean, boring, ""racist,"" conservative, Republican! Dear God! But to continue... they move out, and things start, well...""falling apart."" Why? Well, you KNOW why. At least we're supposed to cynically anticipate the why. You probably haven't seen this movie though, so I'll tell you.

Life is ""empty"" and ""desperate."" So, the wife thinks up a ridiculously airheaded plan to skip off to another country. Soon, reality hits, the husband gets promoted, and there's the dilemma: throw it all away, or stay put and make the best of it.

For most sane people, the movie would've ended by there. But the liberal, leftist vermin who write stuff like this hate families, hate women who enjoy their natural role as mothers, hate everything that reminds of a normal, healthy, family-oriented society where men are men and women don't scream like spoiled children the second someone compliments their dress--that's if they ever wear dresses.

Anyway, the move idea flops and then wifey goes from bad to worse. They don't quite turn into the Manson family, but things get rather insane. And why? All because wifey can't play globetrotter.

Of course, this is not the way one is ""supposed"" to see the movie. Liberal lemmings and uneducated imbeciles will surely see the film's biting criticism of a 1950s America. This is yet another attempt by the ""chosen"" to subvert the true and natural values of the Europeans who built this country. Apparently, the mere memory of a better time, before the ""improvements"" of the deceptively titled ""civil rights"" era, affirmative action, when real women were mothers and real men were bread winners, is too much for these parasites to handle. And so the Hollywood propaganda machine keeps spewing its filthy poison into the minds of anyone dumb enough or anyone brainwashed enough to feel ""guilty"" who will listen.

The only positive I could give this film is that it was at least subtle. I mean, at least we didn't see the couple going to a restaurant where a bunch of ""poor, disadvantaged black folks"" were cruelly refused entry by a tight-lipped host because they were not worthy due to the ""color of their skin"" (as if race was skin deep, but that's another subject).

Skip this piece of fetid spew from the minds and hearts of hateful parasites bent on the complete destruction of all that once made white, European-descended society great and go watch something else instead, like ""Blue Lagoon,"" another movie about a couple who discover the natural and fulfilling way in life is the family unit, which this alien, cancerous element in our world is hellbent on tearing apart.",neg
Revolutionary Road,How honest can this movie be when the children are mere props?,10/2/2019,Irie212,6-六月-09,"Hey, Hollywood, here's a question: If life is dull in the suburbs, why doesn't it occur to you that movies set in the suburbs will be dull, too? Because they are. Revolutionary Road is yet another mildly decadent, inert melodrama exploring what writers seem to regard as soul-dead all-white suburbia (American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Little Children, Pleasantville, etc. etc.). In my experience, suburban people are not stereotypically dull.

But dullness isn't this flick's only, or primary, problem. Dishonesty is. In fact, it's hard to say what the most dishonest part is. It might be plot devices like the two Wheeler offspring, who are treated as nothing more than props, yet we're supposed to believe that the third child will matter? Or the other plot device, the mentally ill mathematician, who seems to exist purely to say inflammatory things (he gets to, he's crazy) that let director Sam Mendes give Winslet and DiCaprio chances for histrionics.

But I think the most dishonest thing is Winslet's character, April. A moody hypocrite with bleach-blonde hair and coal-black eyebrows, she baits her husband into drastically changing their lives by following an absurd pipe dream (she doesn't even research these ""secretarial jobs in Paris"" that she talks about), saying that moving to Europe is for his sake when obviously it's just as much, if not more, for her own.

Clearly, we're supposed to have sympathy for April. That's what's dishonest, because nothing about her actions merits sympathy. Both April and Frank are unhappy in the 'burbs (what movie protagonist isn't?), but when Frank chooses to stay and face their responsibilities-- as well as tacitly admit that they aren't artists or writers or actors who have a Bohemian future in Paris-- April becomes a shrew. Along the way, she also contemplates a self-administered abortion (never mind the risks, or Frank's opinion, he's only her husband and the father). April is as selfish, callow and emotionally constipated as it is possible to be. For instance, whenever Frank wants to talk about little matters, like, oh, say, the fact their dinner party just broke up into a near fist-fight, or that she's taken to sleeping on the couch(!!), she retorts, ""Why do you want to discuss EVERYTHING all the time?"" Coward that she is, she wants to run away from her problems, to Paris; short of that, she walks away from her husband when he wants to work things out. I'm all in favor of walking away-- but from this movie, not from life's problems.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Perfect hopelessness,10/10/2019,ande8162,31-十二月-08,"Having read and loved the novel, I can honestly say this is one of the best book to screen adaptations I've seen. It's extremely faithful to Richard Yates' 1961 brooding tale but also highly imaginative in its cinematic reconfiguration. In a way, the film had a stronger impact on me than the book. Going through that whole story in two hours is a devastating experience.

Everyone who worked on this did such a solid job. The entire cast was magnificent. I won't elaborate on any individual performance, because each actor played it to perfection. Director Sam Mendes finally lives up to the standard he set with his first picture, American BEAUTY. Exploring the dark side of American suburbia definitely works for him. Thomas Newman's score is haunting and, although less complex, reminiscent of American BEAUTY's heavily atmospheric soundtrack.

The entire movie is gorgeous to watch. It's full of powerful images that will burn into your memory. I loved the slight surreality to everything. The styles, colors, and strict conformity of 1950s Connecticut has an other-worldly quality. I think it was the right choice to, ever so slightly, heighten and exaggerate the emotions and relations of the characters. It added much needed humor at times and kept things from getting overly raw and dirty. Despite all the stylistic choices, I still felt it was very grounded in reality, and I found it to be almost embarrassingly relatable at times.

If anything negative can be said, I could see this getting criticized for being too perfect, too calculated, too Oscar oriented. It may be all those things, but it's also full of life and truth. The novel is a literary classic. The rights for the film were purchased not long after its original publication, but at that time, no one knew how to make it. Everything aligned just right for this movie to happen. I couldn't imagine this film existing any differently. It may take place in a bygone era, but it has everything needed to be a timeless classic, and as long as people keep getting married, it will always be relevant.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"For anyone who has ever had lost dreams, or love...",10/10/2019,SugarKaneJ,30-十二月-08,"Revolutionary Road is a brutally honest relationship drama, that just might hit a little too close to the bone for some. The unnerving honesty portrayed by the actors makes this film one of the best of the year. Sam Mendes is smart to allow this to be an actor's showcase more than anything else, and boy do they deliver! Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon, and every single actor called upon does a superb job in this movie no matter how tiny the part. But it is DiCaprio who truly shines and completely engulfs the screen with his hauntingly powerful performance. He is so brilliantly nuanced, whether it be in the small, beautifully poetic and tender moments of his performance, or the big, showy scenes for anger and desperation. It is DiCaprio's film.

All the technical aspects of the film are also top notch. Never trying to take attention away from what it most important.

The story is heartbreakingly honest.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Best acting couple for years,10/10/2019,lostinaction,4-二月-09,"During watching this movie I was thinking the performances of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are convincing and extremely good. In my opinion one of the best and most believable couple I've seen for years in cinema. Both knew each other well as if they played a hundred times together. Strange to know that it is only her second movie together. For me the acting is very important in a drama. It was good to see that in the supporting cast Michael Shannon has a remarkable performance as crazy neighbor and the always good Kathy Bates as his mother. Of course all the other actors are also showing solid performances.

This Drama from Director Sam Mendes shows the life of a young couple in the 50's of the last century. Sam Mendes directed also the famous ""American Beauty"" and again he let us see what happens behind the doors of the houses of American families. It's a satirical look which includes tragedy and love. Revolutionary Road is not a Comedy in the classical meaning so keep this in mind when you watching it else you could get an unpleasant kick.

What was keeping my attention? Firstly as mentioned the acting and then of course the realistic story about a couple in the 1950's. When I first saw Leonardo DiCaprio on screen I was thinking he is dressed in a Frank Sinatra Style. So please also watch at the settings and costumes. All were selected carefully. The cinematography is as usual beautiful in a Sam Mendes Movie.

If you like Drama and like to see good performances in a setting of the 1950's this Movie is definitely for you.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Sitting through torture would be less depressing than this film,10/3/2019,saarvardi,23-一月-09,"So you think life's tough? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet! If you really want to suffer, try living in 1950's suburban hell. In that period, women's freedom and choice of career was virtually non-existent, and whoever tried to shake this equation, often found themselves on the wrong side of society's ability to tolerant social turbulence.

In American Beauty director Sam Mendes's adaptation of the bestseller Revolutionary Road, Frank and April Wheeler (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together on screen for the first time since Titanic!), a young, suburban couple going through the motions of life. April, who doesn't want to play the role of the lonely housewife, makes life miserable for husband Frank, who can't seem to make her happy. When April comes up with a daring idea to relocate to Paris, France, the consequences of the decision manage to make the couple's life even glummer.

Personally speaking, I found Revolutionary Road to be a depressing experience, lacking the optimism or cynicism director Sam Mendes demonstrated in films like American Beauty or Jarhead. Instead, everything that happened to the characters of the film was so tragic and sad, that I was counting the minutes for the thing to be over. The acting was good, but nothing we haven't seen before in the department of suburban melodramas - even those starring the same actors (Winslet was much better in Little Children, which was more or less similar to RR, except that it took place in modern day and was much more tongue-in-cheek fun). DiCaprio was OK, but good thing he earned his Oscar recognition for bigger, better roles like The Aviator and Blood Diamond and not this train-wreck of a film.

Now, I don't know about you guys, but these sort of blunt, straight-out realistic dramas don't help me feel better about myself or get a better perspective of life (like I believe most films should do). Instead, this film just left me shattered, annoyed and disturbed - and truly unsatisfied.

I gave it 5 point out of 10 (and only because of the decent acting).",neg
Revolutionary Road,Hollywood did its usual twist on what was a good novel,10/1/2019,mikentami1116,23-二月-09,"The novel that this was based on was meant to be a learning lesson. It was intended to show how shallow and unfulfilled lives are when self is all we care about. Instead Hollywood did what Hollywood does best, attempted to make heroes out of selfish arrogant characters who care only for themselves. This movie was just plain awful. The only attracting feature this movie has is an on screen reunion of Kate & Leonardo. Which in could have been a good thing, but given the nature of this film they should have left off saying goodbye while floating on a door in the icy ocean after the Titanic sunk. Michael Shannon is a good actor who needs to find himself some good roles to really put his name on screen. He shouldn't be too upset about losing his academy award to Heath Ledge since this film was so bad to begin with.

Why would I care for a story in the 1950s? On top of that, nothing important to this story. A couple not satisfied with their life? What is new or exciting about this? They want to move to live a better life? So? Where is the stupid story? I couldn't also sympathize with any of the characters. Bof, a waste of time and a boring movie!!

Revolutionary Road,Leo and Kate riding the boat again,10/7/2019,dromasca,4-四月-09,"One decade after American Beauty Sam Mendes directs another strong melodrama located in the American suburbs, going back in time to the mid of the 50s at the time the powerful suburban myth and way of life was born. Mendes is cruelly X-raying the feelings and the conflicts of the generation that exited victorious from the war, enjoyed the post-war prosperity and fathered the baby bloom, a generation that made it materially but seemed to fail emotionally and culturally, falling into conventionalism and emptiness which only the late 60s flower generation will wipe away.

As principal actors Mendes brings back together Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the royal couple made famous by Titanic. This film seems to a certain extent a negation of the big love story in Cameron's blockbuster, and Leo and Kate's act make their relation in the film dramatic, credible and even memorable in its best moments. Actually the whole cast is wonderfully chosen and another performance to remember belongs to Michael Shannon who is playing the hospitalized son of the neighbors who under the cover of his mental problems plays the role of the Shakespearean fool, telling the truth in face of his guests.

Great acting and some memorable cinema scenes like the starting train ride and parade of hats from the suburbs to the city at the beginning cannot yet make from an interesting film a great one. The principal problem of 'Revolutionary Road' seemed to me to be the theatrical setting of many of the dialogs in the film. The evolution of the relationship between the two heroes, the emptiness of their lives, and the failure to fill them with content are being told in scenes that may looks better on a Broadway stage but less on a cinema screen. It's really a shame, as Mendes seems to be a creator really capable of strong visual impact. However, the two talents of Sam Mendes visual expressed and directing his actors cannot get together to make of 'Revolutionary Road' the great film it could be.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Amazing film with completely powerful performances,10/10/2019,Green_Acres,28-十二月-08,"Boy, it was a tremendous film. It was very gritty, too much at times, but it certainly tackled many aspects that many films have only mentioned. The screenplay and direction were fabulous. Kate Winslet really gave her best performance here. She gives a stunningly powerful performance. She deserves to win the Oscar. Dicaprio was just as powerful. The supporting cast was great, and Michael Shannon was just amazing. Besides Ledger, he gives the best male supporting performance of the year. An important film. Powerful acting and writing makes this film the best of 2008

10/10 Superb

Revolutionary Road,Awful all the more than Kate and Leo don't make a second Atlantic cruise (web),10/1/2019,leplatypus,6-十月-13,"Well, after a half hour, i was wondering what this movie was about: babbles, nothing happens. So if the goal was to depict a boring couple life, at least, it's accurate. I was just about to stop it as Kate has a terrific moment: it was about being free, doing what we would have decided and not lose our life in a dull monotony. It strikes me as reaching 40, I feel exactly the same than this Leo at 30: Funnily, we live in different country, fifty years apart and nothing has changed: taking train to job, surfing into a wave of grey suits clones, tied to a desk... So i was really excited to see this family come to Paris and i was already happy to see Kate and Leo embark on a Cunard ship this time and maybe it will the same deep emotions as ""Hideous Kinky"" ! But my joy was short-lived: they never make the trip! They are stuck in their suburb, babbling, ... I can't say more because if i haven't stop it, i just keep forwarding to the end! So the director has done the most successful James Bond after: hope he gives him more punch !

Revolutionary Road,Stupid Movie From Start to Finish,10/1/2019,mrvirgo,1-一月-09,"Wow! this movie has got to be the biggest stinker of 2008. My idea of entertainment is not to watch to totally manipulated characters go from alpha to omega in what they want out of life. People don't just work for years to achieve the American dream only to throw it away suddenly on some sill whim. The characters don't seem real to life, rather they exist to give expression to the author's point of view which is pretty stupid as far as I am concerned. If the writer(s) wanted to examine suburban living and come down on it as empty and shallow, they did a pretty crummy job. Two hours of fighting and screaming hardly made me think achieving the American dream is not worth it. Rather it bored me silly and I couldn't wait for the credits to start rolling. When will Hollywood make a movie about happily married people? I don't think I'll live long enough to see the day.

Revolutionary Road,The Wheelers aren't so special,10/3/2019,ferguson-6,4-一月-09,"Greetings again from the darkness. Evidently I am one of the few who didn't like the movie, and just to be clear, that doesn't bother me one iota. This is a depressing, non-message movie stuck in an unrealistic setting with characters who we don't care the least bit about. The fact that the American Beauty and Road to Perdition director assembled such a strong cast doesn't override the fact that it is just not a good film.

Basically we get a chance meeting at a party between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Love at first sight seems to happen because he is a longshoreman and she is an actress-wannabe who has never been anywhere or done anything. When she says he is the most interesting man she has ever met, we can only assume that he must also be the first. Besides that ... what does he see in her?

Flashforward a few years to a miserable life in early 60's suburbia and a couple of kids and we are then subjected to 90 minutes of screaming and bickering and crying and depression and anger. You know there is an entire segment of the law (and a Tammy Wynette song) just for these situations ... it is called D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Just do it folks. The whole thing is just ridiculous. And where are the KIDS?? They are only in a couple of scenes. Not sure how that happens. I know my kids were around the house most of their childhood.

The most interesting character in the movie is the white-jacket worthy son of Kathy Bates played by Michael Shannon (the mysterious marine seen in World Trade Center). His twisted and vile psychoanalysis of Leo and Kate is spot on, though ridiculous in itself.

Director Sam Mendes (Kate's real life husband) is blessed to have Winslet and DiCaprio cast or this film would die a quick death at the box office and most assuredly would not end up on any best of lists for this year. Based on Richard Yates' novel, the only explanation I have for the terrific reviews is that they are a product of the reputation of the novel and the high profile parties involved, and not for the finished project of this film.

Revolutionary Road,Grand Crap,10/1/2019,Moviespot,27-三月-09,"This film was terrible....i could'nt believe how badly constructed it was. the 'most ' unforgivable fault was to cast Leonardo di Caprio for his role. He was soooo unconvincing in depicting his character.the relationship between Blanchet en Leonardo looked like that of a schoolteacher (Blachet) putting in on with her favorite student somewhat later in the movie it looked like Mother/son.....di Caprio was totally miscast-ed. then the story...unbelievable weak in execution....I mean fi. here is an urban family with two daughters which are hardly ever to be seen..... the couple's verbal, loud fights are never interrupted by crying children who wanted to know what's going on... the Drama...it was not Drama enough and the director never convinces in telling us the 'tragedy'.... the clue was meager and predictable..... a film which will be forgotten quickly.... the hardest to swallow part: a mediocre role by a wrongly casted Di Caprio.(like boy scout captain?)who should only play roles fitting his age or search a better make-up artist.

Revolutionary Road,Awful movie about awful people,10/2/2019,gweller-3,5-一月-09,"I was disgusted by what I was watching in this hollow movie about self-absorbed people, one of which can't take the responsibility of the decisions they have made. I'm so sick of movies catering to irresponsible lifestyles. If you can't handle children then don't have unprotected sex ESPECIALLY when you are as old as the characters are in this movie. I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters nor was what little love they have for each other even believable. Titanic was a better movie than this and that's not saying much.

Leo's character is the typical selfish prick businessman who cheats on his wife with an office girl. Kate's character is self absorbed and unwilling to take responsibility for their decisions. Either Kate's acting was bad or the character is such a piece of crap that I couldn't for one second believe that she wanted to go to France so that her husband could find out what he wants to do.

******* SPOILER (to some extent) *******

The choice Kate's character made in the end was the most selfish decision anyone could make in that situation. It was disgusting to say the least, but you know what, it fit right in with her hollow selfish bitch of a character.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Don't Even Waste Your DVD Rental Dollars On This,10/1/2019,Katie28217,19-一月-09,"I am part of a group of avid movie-goers, seeing at least two films every week. There have been some really good ones lately....""The Wrestler"", ""The Reader"", ""Doubt"".... all movies that make you think. This movie was absolutely terrible. This movie is one of those that I cant believe anyone really enjoys but feels like they have to say how great it is because it seems like it should be considered great. I was really looking forward to seeing Winslet and DiCaprio together again. Their chemistry is terrific. Well, we see them meet and fall in love in the first three minutes or so of the film. Then flash forward 10 years to when they are miserable. Nothing in between other than a couple of short flashbacks. I don't care about either one of them. They are shallow uninteresting people who have delusions of how special they are or could be. There is a lot of staring, staring, staring while meaningful music plays in the background. It's like an afternoon soap opera. A whole lot of marginally interesting stuff is drawn waaaaayyyy out and even though we know they have kids, we never see them. I think they must have been in foster care.....don't waste your money on this drivel.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Why Did They Bother,10/2/2019,TonkaTom,31-十二月-08,"This film depressed and bored the pants off me, the only thing remotely interesting or entertaining was Kate Winslet's curious American accent.

With a prosaic storyline and stilted dialogue I was left wondering how on earth anyone could ever think this film was ever worth making, then I realised - DiCaprio & Winslet reunited; a marketing department's dream.

I predict this film will do exceptionally well..... at the Razzies.

Anyway, I made a note of the Director's name - Sam Mendes - won't be going to any more of his dross again!

P.S. I loved American Beauty, but that had a good storyline.

Revolutionary Road,Travel from South Pacific to the Cuckoo's Nest aboard the Ballad of Lucy Jordan,10/7/2019,nick suess,20-一月-09,"Well, to be taken on such a journey really must have something for everyone, but along the way, we don't find out very much about these characters. What exactly was it on some enchanted evening that caused these two to spot one another as strangers across a crowded room? It seemed to be an artistic party, and must have been, as there was even a token black man there, something which would have been socially very unusual in the late 40s, even in NYC. So what was Frank, who claimed to be a longshoreman, doing there? Clearly April had some measure of artistic pretensions, and we flash forward and there she is 'starring' in the local small town am-dram production. Pity it's a flop, but she is already sufficiently off her trolley to take this as a sign that her entire life is useless. And we do get the impression that she is already in the habit of turning her marital favours on and off like a tap. So Frank has had enough, and pretty soon it's wombat time for him.

We ask ourselves where can they go from here? To our great surprise, it is the inspiration of a pic of Frank as a young GI at the liberation of Paris that leads April to instantly decide the cure for their increasingly troubled marriage is to pack up everything and move to that romantic city she has never visited.

And so the fantasy drags on. To try and get the boss off his back, Frank spouts some piece of impromptu bullshit, and is instantly proclaimed a genius and offered promotion beyond his wildest dreams. That's conflict point 1 with the Paris plan, and simultaneous conflict point 2 is that April gets up the duff. I think this was about the conflict point at which I began to realise I was hungry, and wondered how much longer this would all go on.

But then it got better. Introduce the local loony to upstage the lot of them, and hey, we even had a bit of 'Beautiful Mind' in there, as he had a PhD in maths! His brain had been fried by electric shocks, which had destroyed the maths, but led him to have an uncanny perception about those around him. He, as the 'fool on the hill' saw through the entire thing, and nobody liked that.

Now, Lucy Jordan, the woman who ""realised she'd never drive through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair"" lived then and continues to live in so many of us who eke out our dull suburban lives, raising our children, and growing old. Lucy Jordan is not new. Telling her story over is valid for us to watch and learn, and for going into that zone, and asking those difficult questions, I am prepared to raise my vote to 7/10. But where was the attempt to answer the questions?

In many ways I found myself admiring April at that point, as despite her fairly unsympathetic character she did dare to dream. I can remember the 50s, and the stifling pressures of that era to conform, these being laid down by an older generation simply grateful to be alive and free after the horror of two global conflicts. I was strongly reminded of a wonderful aunt who likewise defied that society by undertaking Bohemian travel all over Europe. Single and childless, and based in London, she had far fewer issues than April to confront, but I still think she made her important decisions upon the basis of more than just an old snapshot of the Eiffel tower, which was all that seemed to get April started. Was that how her decision was made? I did sympathise more with Frank, the brief shot of him as one of the swarm of trilby hats emerging from Grand Central was very powerful, evocative of 'Koyaanisqatsi'. Despite the numbing boredom of his job, he was knuckling down and getting on with raising his kids. And here suddenly was this notion, a brief fleeting glimpse of a seductively different life. But how was his decision made? Why did he suddenly flip from 'no' to 'yes', especially with the already growing realisation that he was married to a fruit cake? You see, in a story such as this, I expect the movie maker to really take us into some depth on the genuine conflict we face when being confronted by difficult decisions. Maybe the book explored this, but I haven't read it. Mendes cops out of it completely. So we are left with just the loony to tell us the truth.

Maybe we should listen more carefully to lunatics!",pos
Revolutionary Road,A missed opportunity,10/6/2019,howard.schumann,18-一月-09,"In life, we either have the things that we want or the reasons why we do not have them. Based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road tackles the issue of what it would take to go beyond the reasons and create a life of authenticity. The film reunites the popular stars of Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, as a suburban couple, Frank and April Wheeler, who see themselves as special but whose mediocre lives do not reflect their ideals. Set in suburban Connecticut in the 1950s, the main protagonists mirror the growing intellectual malaise and search for meaning that lay beneath the outward superficiality of the ""affluent society"", an undercurrent that would give birth to the counterculture and the more open social environment of the 1960s.

As they move into their new house on Revolutionary Road with their two small children, Michael (Ty Simpkins) and Jennifer (Ryan Simpkins), Frank (DiCaprio) and Alice (Winslet) are determined not to be trapped by their surroundings but their self-deception and inertia ensures that they will get what they resist. They devise schemes to escape that seem plausible on the surface, but fail to confront the fact that they are comfortable in being the people that they used to mock. Ultimately, the gap between their aspirations and their ability to achieve them leads to growing frustration and an inevitable breakdown in their relationship that has sad consequences.

The film opens when Frank and Alice spot each other at a party and the closeness of their dancing indicates a strong chemistry between them. Flashing forward seven years, however, the promise of the opening scene has deteriorated to bickering conflict. Alice, who aspires to be an actress, is disappointed with her performance in the local theater and, on the drive home, becomes furious with Frank who berates her acting ability. Frank is now a thirty-year-old salesman for a business machines corporation in Manhattan, the same company his father worked for, and professes to hate his job.

Recognizing their untenable situation, Alice proposes that they sell their house and move to Paris where she can work in the NATO secretarial pool and Frank can ""find himself"" and begin to live the life he has dreamed of. Initially reluctant, Frank slowly warms to the idea, seeing it as a way to obtain a release from the suburban mentality personified by Frank's co-workers and neighbors Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) who view their proposed move as radical and silly. When Frank is praised at a job for a report he has written and offered a promotion and higher salary by Bart Pollack (Jay O. Sanders), however, doubts begin to surface about the Paris decision.

Soon the couple's arguments take on a more vicious tone, their confidence undermined by visits to their home by their realtor Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), her husband Howard (Richard Easton), and their mentally disturbed son John (Michael Shannon). Free from social restraints, John unleashes a searing indictment of Frank and Alice's values and his verbal thrusts are the film's power point. As a final straw, Alice reveals that she is pregnant and ideas about Paris must be re-evaluated. Fine performances by Winslet and DiCaprio support a solid, workmanlike effort by Mendes, but the film lacks the poetry that would raise it to another level and the dialogue is often self-conscious and overly theatrical. What could have been a work of power and beauty becomes instead a missed opportunity and, in Mendes' hand, Revolutionary Road is a dead end street.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Horrible overrated movie.,10/3/2019,mcdude-1,29-一月-09,"Was so so so bad. What a horrible movie. My girlfriend and I could not wait till it ended. After the movie was over half of the theater was laughing, and this by no means was a comedy. There were multiple parts in the movie that were not suppose to be funny but people were cracking up! Imagine a horror movie so bad you laugh at it - that's what this is like. What a piece of garbage. Kate Winslet best actress? What a joke.

The movie has no plot and proves nothing. It is slow and builds into...NOTHING. The acting is good at best, and over done at that, and cannot save this film. There is absolutely NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Speaking of which, there are characters that make no sense. Especially a ""mentally ill"" guy that is in here for no reason. It takes place in the 1950s, why? They could have saved money on customs and have had this take place in present time. The score for the film is absolutely atrocious. They kept playing the same thing over and over again. One of the worst parts in the movie is when Kate Winslet is dancing to MUSIC and then they cut into the score of the movie. Why? She is dancing and now you're playing slow music? It makes no sense.

not even rent worthy.

I'm reading other reviews on IMDb and I see not only the people in the theater I was at were laughing at it, but other people on IMDb as well.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Sam Mendes Hates American Suburbs,10/5/2019,J. Ryan,28-十二月-08,"The New York Times called this ""pessimism without redemption"" -- that's pretty accurate. Despite strong performances by DiCaprio and Winslet, the film never exceeds a relentless hammering of the banal American suburban existence by Sam Mendes. Within 5 minutes, we see an all-too-real-feeling argument between our lead couple over the realization that Winslet's character is just not a talented actress. From there, we are subjected to a near 2 hours of the worst moments of couples therapy. The problem with Revolutionary Road is shared by both the source material (Richard Yates' novel) as well as the direction. Mendes' earlier treatise on suburban existence - American Beauty - worked because of the self-deprecating humor of Kevin Spacey. Here, there's no humor, just multiple layers of misery. It doesn't help that a little careful scrutiny of that misery uncovers how trivial the couples problems really are (the couple wants to move to Paris because they are in a rut living in the NY metro area. Funny how no one asks, ""Why not get another job?""). In the end, R^2 is really a mediocre stage play filled with misplaced angst. Without any real drama (or perhaps too much of it), I really left the theater asking myself ""who cares?""",neg
Revolutionary Road,A good film but one which never quite escapes the confines it puts itself in,10/7/2019,bengood4000,15-十二月-08,"I saw Revolutionary Road this evening and to be honest before sitting down to watch it I was sceptical. Was this to be an American Beauty rip off? A blatant ploy for Oscar glory? In the end my fears were allayed, it's a very good piece. What makes this film are the lead performances, Winslet and Dicaprio are both outstanding. Their characters crack and crumble before your eyes. You believe completely in these wrecks of people, and as their lives go from one turmoil to the next you will them to make the right decisions and feel for them when things go wrong.

I felt that the main problem with the film was the plot. I have no quibbles with what does happen in the film it just to me felt that not enough happened in the 2 hour running time, it set its self as a look at a conflict between a married couple and that was its downfall. There is very little else other the arguments of a married couple and in the end that gets a little tiring.

I would though say that this film is well worth a watch, the performances are terrific and it is beautifully shot, I just don't think it is the seminal commentary on marriage it sets out to be.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road,10/1/2019,pyjamapaula,5-七月-09,"I would like to comment about this movie, 'Revolutionary Road' (2008. I've read the previous comments, and I respect everyone's comments, everyone has their own opinion. In fact, I really wish I could agree with them as Kate Winslet & Leo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors and I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. I finally rented it tonight, and I was so terribly disappointed with this movie that I can't sleep! I've been through a rough marriage dissolution and it was nothing like this. I thought the movie was too long, extremely boring, not to mention dark and disturbing. The parts with Kathy Bates' real estate character's son, the mentally disturbed man, were, in my opinion, confusing and did not fit into the movie at all. The relationship with the neighbors were not relevant, odd and plain creepy. I thought the film was horrible. Sorry, just my opinion!",neg
Revolutionary Road,Felt like a well-made episode of Desperate Housewives without the comedy...,10/6/2019,oscarfanatic,25-十二月-08,"Revolutionary Road, helmed by American Beauty Oscar winning director Sam Mendes, could be the biggest disappointment of 2008.

Now, don't get me wrong... the movie was good. It just... fell flat. Though pumped with emotional contact between the characters, it ultimately felt emotionless for me. Beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, though. Another fine cinematographic job from the master of his field.

What I wanted to be so much just couldn't be. Of course, Kate Winslet was great in the role, but I don't think this is anywhere near her best work, and it would be a shame to see an Oscar go to this performance when 2008 was such a wonderful year for the leading ladies. A nomination? Well, of course... but the win will not be deserved.

Now to DiCaprio. Though I fully acknowledge that the man can act, and in some cases very well, he just seems to me to be processing the same role. He isn't very versatile as an actor at all, and this role just held no challenges for him. Any number of actors could have pulled more from the role. The performance, though shouty, was really two-dimensional for me.

And now to the best part of the movie: the supporting actors. Michael Shannon brings his A-game to a very small but pivotal role in the story. He provides the climax so wonderfully, yet had to play off of an obvious screenplay. All that his character did was trumpet the whole message of the movie, and for me, the meaning of any great work is ultimately subversive and not blatant. Obviously the scene was required to provide a goal point, but still... this is the fault of the screenplay, which is very faithful to the book, which is probably where the REAL problem lies. This book was just not a book that adapted well to the screen, I think.

Kathy Bates clocks in a lovely little performance as Michael Shannon's mother, wishing to excuse her son's every fanaticism with a mental illness. A shame really, because Jon was such an interesting character, if completely unnecessary.

So, like I said, this was a good movie. Just one that was unnecessary to make. A rehashing of a story already told (by the same director), with several well-acted scenes, a wonderful performance throughout from Kate, a sub-par script based on a sub-par book, all shown beautifully by Roger Deakins.

A 6 out of 10 (but just barely)",neg
Revolutionary Road,They'll Never Have Paris,10/8/2019,WriterDave,3-一月-09,"In one of the classiest pieces of stunt casting in recent years, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes reunites his wife, Kate Winslet, with her ""Titanic"" shipmate Leonardo DiCaprio to play the Wheelers in his screen adaptation of Richard Yates' novel ""Revolutionary Road."" It adds an appealing accessibility to an otherwise depressing tale.

The film opens boldly enough, spending just a few fleeting moments showing us how the Wheelers met before throwing us head first into their disaster of a marriage. April (Winslet) always had dreams of being an actress and Frank (DiCaprio), well, Frank always had some vague idea of living in Paris. The film chronicles their sad story. The Wheelers are meant to represent the post WWII generation who during the prosperous 1950's created suffocating lives due to dreams deferred in exchange for chasing the so-called ""American Dream"" that they never really believed in. Everyone else in the film is in some sort of love with the Wheelers and their picture perfect lives, but the Wheelers hate themselves, each other, their neighbors, and what they have become. It's a damning little portrait that has been painted before in literature and film, but never quite so acutely.

I haven't read Richard Yates' novel, but I am currently reading his collection of short stories which address many of the same themes and bear his hallmarks present here: cutting dialog, keen insights into the psyche of his sometimes despicable or just plain sad characters, and obsessive attention to details of time and place. In terms of the tone of Yates' writing, Mendes is successful in his translation. However, that tone that worked so well on the page doesn't always work on screen. We're never sure if we're meant to sympathize with the Wheelers or if Mendes wants us to view it as a dark comedy where we watch in sick delight as the popular kids who always thought they were more interesting than everyone else grow up to be horribly dysfunctional and cripplingly normal. Much of the audience I saw the film with laughed to break the tension during some of Mendes' trademarked ""uncomfortable dinner table scenes"", but we all watched in horror as the film spun out of control into its downer of a climax.

Ultimately one sits through a film like this for the acting, and it doesn't disappoint on that level. Taking a line from the film, DiCaprio is a ""cracker jack"" playing for the first time a husband, a father, and a hopelessly average Joe. Winslet is on more familiar ground, but never has she been given so much range to roam, and her director husband lets her run wild and free. It's a neurotic, brave, and sometimes questionable performance that is a rare sight to behold. At times it seems as if Mendes is directing a stage-play rather than a film, and he lets the whole cast scream and holler against his finely detailed period backdrops, but it's still entertaining for those who enjoy watching polished professionals (including Michael Shannon portraying a man on leave from an insane asylum in a perfect pitch) stretch their acting muscles.

One watches the grim dissolution of this marriage wondering if there isn't some subtext to explore with regards to Winslet and Mendes' own seemingly perfect Hollywood marriage. And as unlikable as they are at times, and no matter how much we would rather laugh at then relate to another human being, one can't escape the sickening feeling that there might be a little bit of Frank and April Wheeler in all of us.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Amazing,10/8/2019,movieman8877445,27-十二月-08,"Revolutionary Road is the new powerful drama from Sam Mendes. It starts off with April and Frank first meeting, they meet at a party and they start to have a conversation. She wants to be actress, but it turns out that she isn't that great, and Frank finds that out while watching one of her plays. Many years pass and it shows Frank at work, he's not too happy with his job, and apparently he's not too happy with his marriage because he starts to have an affair with one of the girls at his work. But then he goes home to find his wife and kids were throwing him a little 30th birthday party. But Frank and April are both sick of their current life, so after talking with each other they decide they need a new life and plan to move to Paris. Frank then starts to fade away from the idea once he gets offered a better job at his current work place, and then they find out something else that ultimately makes them stay in their current life. April isn't happy with this life though and she really can't stand this life anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, David Harbour, Kathryn Hahn, and Michael Shannon all star in this incredible drama.

The acting from the entire cast is incredible; I don't think there was even one bad acting moment from anyone in the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio shines out of this cast the best by far, I wouldn't be surprised if he wins 'Best Actor' at this year's academy awards, and I'm going to be upset if he doesn't at least get nominated because he definitely deserves it. He really stood out in once scene alone when he's fighting and arguing with Kate Winslet's character. Kate Winslet was also amazing, not quite as amazing as DiCaprio though, I can definitely see her getting nominated for 'Best Actress' though, I'm not sure I see her winning though, I could be surprised though. Kathy Bates was great for the parts she was in, she constantly appears throughout the whole movie, and the scenes she was in were great though. David Harbour was also really good; I really liked his character in this though, just the stuff that happened with his character was great. Kathryn Hahn was good, her character seemed to really freak me out though, just the smile that she had on her face throughout the movie. Michael Shannon was the best out of the cast after DiCaprio and Winslet though, I've seen him in some small roles before but I never really noticed that he had great acting though. I mean his role in this was pretty small too, but the parts he was in were just amazing, I was completely blown away by his acting. His character was supposed to be messed up in the head though, and he did a great job showing it.

The story for this was great; it started off a little slow though IMO. Some of this really reminded me of American Beauty, I think if you liked American Beauty you should check this one out, because it wasn't like exactly the same thing or anything, but the concept was sort of like American Beauty. I was glued to the movie right up until the last 25 minutes or so, I mean I think this has one of the best and most emotional scenes that I've ever seen in the movie, and it was towards the end. But I feel after that scene, the ending just gets dry right up until the last 5 minutes or so, and then it really got me interested in it again. I didn't mind that the ending was dry much though, because the rest of the movie before that really made up for the dry ending. The acting sort of stole the show from the story though, but that doesn't mean the story was bad or anything, just that the acting was amazing.

Overall I absolutely loved it, I think this is probably tied with The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as my second favorite movie of the year, but I still have quite a few movies to see from this year first though, so that may be flip flopping around some. Also like Benjamin Button, I think this is probably going to make it somewhere between the 20 and 30 spot in my favorites list. I think in the end I may end up liking this more than Benjamin Button though because I'm pretty sure that this will have a better rewatchabilty standard than Benjamin Button. This has to be like my favorite movie from Sam Mendes, I'd have to re-watch American Beauty and Road To Perdition just make sure though, but I'm still pretty sure. This for me actually lived up to the hype, because I was hyping myself up to watch this a little because I thought the trailer looked amazing and it definitely deserved it. I can also definitely see this snagging 'Best Picture' at the academy awards this year though, but if you're one of the ones lucky enough to have this playing at a theater near you, I suggest you go and see it before it leaves because it's definitely worth the price of an admission price.

Revolutionary Road,Mannered dress up tale of a crumbling marriage didn't work for me,10/5/2019,dbborroughs,28-十二月-08,"Sam Mendes is back in crumbling family territory with this adaptation of a Richard Yates novel about the implosion of a family in early 1960's American suburbia. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the Wheelers. We see how they meet at a party and then we flash forward to Kate performing in a not very good local theater production which leads into a heated argument on the way home. From there we watch as the pair try to navigate their life together and in the suburban wasteland around them.

I'm not going to lie I found this a tough slog. I never really clicked with the material for a variety of reasons and so found myself squirming in my seat. The main problem for me is that the film seemed more like a dress up affair rather then real people. Everything is spotless in the way that suburbia is always pictured to be, but never really was except when some people were having guests. Everything in the entire film is picture perfect and artificial. It could be argued that this is the way the characters see the world, but when it extended to Leo's office where there was nary a sign of any work on anyones desk I had to throw up my hands. Mendes maybe making a point but at the same time I found it all terribly obvious.

The performances are good with the exception of Kathy Bates who is so loud and obnoxious as to unbalance the rest of the film. I know that in some way she is a form of Greek Chorus but at the same time one had wished that she was a little less noisy. (Though it makes the final image more understandable from both the context of the scene it self and the film as a whole.) Give it a shot if you like the stars or like dress up tragedy.",neg
Revolutionary Road,more than just suburban angst,10/8/2019,jonathan-trapp,7-六月-09,"Most people hailed it as a masterpiece; the minority insisted it was pretentious and meaningless. Neither is the truth. That's part of what makes it interesting-- its ambiguity. Even though nut-case mathematician Michael Shannon bluntly shouts out many of the ostensible themes of the picture in an over-the-top scene, the thinking, open-minded viewer is left to guess, or decide whether the hellish marriage between thirty-something Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is the result of our stifling, conformity driven capitalist culture (I think I already used that line, but it applies) and/OR the result of a neurotic, narcissistic housewife whose unfulfilled, grandiose dreams destroy the lives of those around her. There's no question about the overall quality of the production. I'd say its the story of two people just smart enough to see through the empty, soul-sucking aspects of modern life but lacking the imagination to transcend it. Which is, in itself, a very sad, sad story.",pos
Revolutionary Road,How revolutionary can you be?,10/9/2019,tiago-c-lemos,18-三月-09,"I still have the anguish and distress in my stomach. The same I had when the movie was over and the same I had when I went to bed that night.

Leonardo Di Caprio still looks like the same kid as in Titanic, always good-looking and elegant, but now making the biggest effort to convince us that he is a great actor. The truth is that he is. There is nothing much to prove...

I didn't know much about the movie and never read the book before. My choice was purely based in the quality of the actors and director and maybe a trailer I had seen previously. Fortunately 100 minutes later I was seating with the impression of having seen one of the best movies of the year.

A movie that can describe the suffocation of living a life full of conventionalisms and the frustration from dealing with the impossibility of getting rid of them. Any argument from the Wheeler's in the 50's can be the exact same argument from the Johnson's in the 00's in a suburb anywhere. But ""Revolutionary Road"" is not only the typical story of a couple who buys a house, has kids, goes out with the friendly neighbor's and one day starts asking ""what are we doing around here?""...

Seems like no one knows the answer except a magnificent character, a neighbor's son who has a psychiatric problem. Maybe sometimes you just need to be a little insane to see things as they really are.

No need to tell you anymore. Please go and watch it for yourselves. Devastating but necessary.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Buy the DVD for someone you hate.,10/2/2019,coolaspants,5-二月-09,"Wow. What a depressing, worthless film. Marc and I went to see this last night - I only hope that he can forgive me for suggesting it. What people say is partly true: Kate Winslet's performance allows her to show her range as the trapped, middle class suburban housewife - she is convincing and at times bold. Michael Shannon is Oscar nominated for his role as a mentally ill neighbour who is the only one willing to speak what everybody else is thinking - his key scene is hilarious and horrific.

The cinematography and period detail are beautiful and James Newton's score is affecting - particularly in a scene where Winslet grasps the last moments of light against the back garden tree, while, after their biggest bust up yet, Leo DiCaprio wanders around in the darkness of the house on Revolutionary Road - the house that typified everything 'perfect' about their life.

As just about every critic ever has noted, the concept is not original; David Lynch blew it apart in 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks' and surely after 3 seasons of Desperate Housewives, it's no longer an alien concept. As Kermode notes Todd Haynes' 'Far From Heaven' takes this initial premise in a far more interesting and brave direction, a beautiful film that I would watch 20 times before I ever set eyes on Revolutionary Road again. Bearing in mind that RR comes from Sam Mendes, who delved with insight and originally into this same white-picket lie with American Beauty ten years ago, it's even more disappointing to watch this film that adds nothing to our understanding.

I haven't even got to what's bad about it yet; the sheer hopelessness of the script, the clichéd dialogue, its torturous length, the bizarre sidelining of the kids or the moral corruption unbalanced without any sense of regret, repentance or redemption. Most of all, we both came out of the cinema with the same key observation: none of the characters were likable. Nothing about them was endearing, upright, selfless, loving, hopeful or genuine. Summed up, RR was over 2 hours of hateful, self-deceived people wrapped up in their purposeless, spiralling lives. Maybe that was the point?

On a personal note, it confirmed to me that I really do dislike DiCaprio as an actor - only his performance in The Departed approached bearable. The only thing revolutionary about this film is what a tragic waste of time and talent it is, bringing absolutely nothing of worth into the world. I'd rather lose a limb than watch this again. Not only the most bitter, unfathomable film I've seen in the past 12 months but probably ever. Buy the DVD for someone you really hate.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Never thinking beyond the (white) self,10/6/2019,cthusky850,4-八月-09,"OK, I agree with most of the glowing comments about performance and filming. However, this is a film that never thinks beyond the most precious needs and desires of the white middle-class (self-fulfillment, anti-consumerism, etc.). The Wheelers are utterly self-absorbed, narcissistic people--whom the film wants us to sympathize with. The film's themes are commonplace: youth's lost dreams, women didn't have it great, conformity is not good, the Fifties were stultifying, consumerism kills the soul, etc. BUT ... this was an extremely exciting decade from another perspective. This decade saw the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement! (As I remember, there was not one minority featured in the film, not one.) Very interesting things were happening in the labor unions during this period as well. The Wheelers (and the film itself) really had an alternative to its narrow critique: looking beyond the confines of white suburbia, the woes of mid-level corporate management, and feminist critiques. The film should have included the social and political context of the 1950s--African Americans and the working class fighting for their rights. That would have been a more devastating critique of the Wheeler's life-style, and would have made it a much more powerful movie.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Grim put-down of 50s Suburbia,10/4/2019,Turfseer,3-八月-09,"Instead of blaming Hollywood for their self-congratulatory tales of suburban angst, why not blame a gullible public? For it's the public that laps up these specious and false tales. Why was 'The Graduate' such a success? Because it gave the average person the right to feel that 'I'm better than you'. It's easy to sneer at a Mrs. Robinson, an adult woman who manipulates the emotions of Dustin Hoffman's 'innocent' college student, Benjamin. She's willing to not only ruin his life but also that of her daughters. Her narcissism knows no bounds. In a nutshell, she's a character who's easy to hate. Hollywood has the formula down pat: give us an innocent rebel who 'doesn't fit in' and have him or her pitted against the 'monster'—the hissing mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama has evolved into the 'conformist' post-war suburbanite.

In Revolutionary Road there is nary a laugh to be heard throughout the entire 118 minutes of the film. No one seems to like themselves at all. At the film's beginning, the suburbanites' community theater production is a complete failure. And the worst performance in the play is given by our protagonist, Kate Winslett's April Wheeler. Heaven forbid people can have fun performing in a community theater production or even laugh at themselves if the production is a little off. No, the point is made from the outset that our community of post-war suburbanites is one of 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness'. This is the profound 'epiphany' that the makers of Revolutionary Road want us to experience and they are going to reveal these 'profound insights' to us. But the truth is, there is no such thing as suburban 'angst'—back then and now the vast majority of people have egos—in short, they like themselves!

Those who have written negative things about Revolutionary Road seem to agree that there is little character development when it comes to April Wheeler. When Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) tells April that she always felt she was someone 'special', the camera comes in close and we see the blank expression on her face. April is not to be blamed for her depression—society has made her into what she is. It's a trite idea that people are not responsible for their own lives but that's what Revolutionary Road serves up here. April is a Bohemian, a free spirit whose main goal is to move to Paris. For half the movie, her plan of liberation is about the only thing we find out about her. Certainly we find out nothing about her personality vis-à-vis her children—they are barely seen in this film and can be best thought of as a set of props in this overblown passion play.

Additional 'props' can be found in the characters of the Wheelers' neighbors, Shep and Millie Campbell. When April and Frank tell them of their plans to move to Paris, they later castigate them in the comfort of their own bedroom as ""immature"". The film's scenarists wish us to identify the Campbells as being arrogant and part of the overall suburban 'emptiness'. Shep loses further points when he beds April just before her final breakdown.

One wonders why Frank is so easily convinced by April to chuck his house and job and run off to Paris with her and the kids. After all, he screams at her for her illusions of becoming a great actress in the opening scene. But somehow she appeals to his earlier idealistic desires to be free and independent before the kids came along. In the blink of an eye, the empty and uncaring suburbanite who has no compunctions about bedding the new pretty office worker suddenly is transformed into a caring, self-actualized mensch who will go along with his wife's bold plan to go where no other suburban couple has gone before.

Don't despair, Frank returns to his vile ways quite soon enough. With a job promotion hanging over his head and the news that April is pregnant, he decides to 'sell out'. Aha, we've finally found out who the antagonist is in this film! Fortunately there is one bright note in Revolutionary Road and that is Michael Shannon's electroshock victim, John Givings. John is basically an ally of April since they both don't fit into society and are labeled as deviant (note that at one point, Frank recommends that April see a shrink!). Before Frank 'sells out', he and April have a nice 'heart-to-heart' talk in the woods with John who echoes the film's theme: people in suburbia might 'get' emptiness but April and (pre-sell-out) Frank 'feel' hopelessness. The non-conformist blesses the free-spirit couple for their 'bravery'. But once Frank takes the new job and decides not to go to Paris, he is the recipient of John's full wrath. A real person would have parried John's blows with perhaps a sense of humor, but since Frank is merely a stand-in for all the ills of suburbia (and hence American society), he comes off as arrogant, defensive and with a severe anger management problem.

The only truly enjoyable moment in Revolutionary Road is when John turns on April for a millisecond. After berating Frank, he whispers in HER ear and tells her in effect that maybe she's no great shakes either! The suggestion that maybe April is not an angel is short-lived. Before you know it, April has done herself in by means of a self-induced abortion. Our beloved bohemian is now enshrined as sacrificial lamb.

Ironically, Revolutionary Road is well-acted and directed. What's more the art design of the film, with its attention to period detail, is a work to behold. The score, while repetitious, is also haunting. But somehow the histrionics of the principal characters do not impress since people are not like that in real life. Stories about people living 'lives of quiet desperation' is not only a myth but 'old hat'. The 'Road' is more empty than the mythic society it creates and attempts to tear down.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Very good and teaches us a little something,10/10/2019,yeah_baby_5,8-二月-09,"I enjoy films that have a hidden lesson. American Beauty had one and so does Sam Mendes' new film Revolutionary Road. This is a very different type of film starring the two main cast members of Titanic. However, this is not a film about Jack and Rose from Titanic and if anything is the complete opposite type of storyline compared to Titanic. The film has a similar type of storyline to American Beauty, only this time it occurs in the 1950s. Based on history classes I have taken in the past, Revolutionary Road's portrayal of life in the 1950s is almost a dead-on match from what I learned. There is the stay at home mother with the working father, where the father is in charge of the household and everyone in it. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Wheeler was interesting and most certainly takes a different approach compared to other films he has done. Kate Winslet's portrayal of April was excellent was definitely worthy of the Golden Globe she received. Michael Shannon's acting was terrific and there is definitely some competition for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. As a male this is not normally the type of movie I would see since I generally watch action films and comedies, however any male can learn a lesson from Revolutionary Road when the film is over. Also if you enjoy films by Sam Mendes you will not be disappointed.

Revolutionary Road,"moving, deeply felt and genuine",10/8/2019,antoniotierno,8-二月-09,"Marital conflict is not a fashionable subject for movies nowadays - maybe it's because the old-fashioned subject of marriage is not that fashionable itself - but this story touches in every respect, there are really original ideas about intimacy, about how many things are to be abandoned in the service of a marriage, about whether the abandonment is tragic or not. Frank's rage, frustration and aggressiveness are interestingly countered by April's stillness and coldness, so that every single argue/fight hits the mark, emotionally speaking. Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio are both really outstanding, they deliver confident performances dominating the film and creating at the same time a huge emotional impact (there's everything, impassivity, fear, anger, cries). This flick must intentionally impress the audience, it's certainly a sad story with a sad ending but perfectly written and acted.

Revolutionary Road,good,10/9/2019,alalistaa,7-二月-09,"I saw this movie and thought it was really very good. Im surprised at the lack of Oscar hype, it is after all exactly the sort of film that gets that kind of attention and it doesn't have the usual excuse of not coming out in Oscar month (do we all really have the memory of a goldfish?).

I'm a firm believer in the human aspect of cinema and ""keeping it real"" and this really matches that criteria with people kept in a rut unable or unwilling to fulfill their dreams, hurting each other and themselves and left hating each other or coldly indifferent. This left an engaging thought provoking watch, which from the Oscar nominations I have seen for best picture, the Oscars this year have been lacking in.

Apparently the novel, by Yates, is near word for word the same as the film. The rest of his novels are along the same lines and i hope that some of these may be developed as well into film. At school i am studying The Great Gatsby and a Streetcar named desire which are written and based around the sameish time and these are a similar sort of domestic tragedies that are also fascinating.

Highly recommended.",pos
Revolutionary Road,An Excuse For 'Acting',10/2/2019,warren-1976,3-二月-09,"I have to admit, I went into this with a little trepidation. The trailers implied a film with little-to-no plot, and two people shouting and arguing a lot. Unfortunately, I wasn't proved wrong.

There's nothing wrong with the idea of an interesting drama documenting the break down of a marriage and/or abortion issues, but Revolutionary Road has no subtlety or progression in dealing with these. Essentially, the marriage is already broken at the start of the film. They start to dream of a new life that will give them a fresh start and fail. The marriage then descends into collapse and the unintentional death of a character.

Of course there's all sorts of 'meaningful' messages here. The real question, is whether they're told in an interesting and effective manner. With the exception of the 'slight' hopefulness of the two leads moving to Paris, the film is utterly one-tone. The characters are never really established with back-story or through any other narrative method. In essence, all we ever learn about them, is: ""This is a suburban couple in the 50s. They shout at each other a lot and are apparently unsatisfied with their lives"" They even have a couple of children that appear briefly in one or two scenes as plot devices, but otherwise seem not to exist. It's as though they have been shoe-horned in after 90% of the film has been completed, to be causes for more of the 'dramatic' scenes between the leads. Obviously this is not the case, but the way it is filmed and told, it may as well have been.

Any messages this film may have had, are lost in the contrived plot and barely even two-dimensional characters. Yes, the basic 'facts' of the story are as realistic or unrealistic as you want them to be, but they are all bound up in a false and extremely forced package. A sign of good characterisation is the ability to think ""If (random event) happened to the character, how would they react?"" and being able to formulate some idea of your own, based on what you have seen and heard. The two leads in Revolutionary Road had no consistency of character at any point. They were just hollow shells for DeCaprio and Winslet to 'act' with.

The whole film comes over as a contrived mess. One of those movies that make the old mistake of thinking ""Lots of dramatic shouting, crying, and vacant long looks, equals good acting and drama."" Yet perhaps that was their main point. To give Winslet and DeCaprio a vehicle in which to indulge in melodramatic over-the-top acting, without lumbering any of the 'acting' scenes with the problems that can be encountered when you establish characters, or give them real reason to behave the way they do. The 'plot' was simply a device by which to have 'emotional acting' scenes for the actors to enjoy getting their teeth into.

The highlights of the film, and some of the few moments it comes alive, are when the somewhat disturbed character of 'John Givings' (Played by Michael Shannon) pops up to deliver some 'home truths' so-to-speak. Sure, he's a blatant device used to hammer home the film's plot points/messages in case we missed them while watching, but nevertheless, he easily becomes the most interesting character in the whole mess. Inadvertently (Especially in his final scene) his character truly sums up the utter banality and pointlessness of the whole story, and how shallow and empty the characters are. Another highlight, is the very final moment of the film when the character's father turns off his hearing-aid in order to blank out the inane ramblings of his shallow wife. Which again, sum up the entire film perfectly.

Perhaps Revolutionary Road is best summed up as the acting equivalent of a bland, plot less summer blockbuster with lots of special effects. Except in this case the 'effects' are Winslet and DeCaprio's 'acting' for the sake of acting, and once you get past that, there's not a lot left that's Revolutionary.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Two of the best actors of their generation,10/9/2019,lpt1021,29-十二月-08,"What an amazing film. First, I have to day that Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are probably the best actors of their generation. Their performances are deep, emotional and outstanding as they're able to portray this troubled couple and make you feel sorry for them. The way the different emotions cross their faces in a matter of seconds is truly award-winning. What takes you to that level of anger and boredom? What makes you think that moving from the place that is making your life miserable is going to change it? I don't know, but this is what Frank and April thought. They thought that by leaving to another country their problems and worries would fade away, but the truth is, they would just follow them. They never dare face the truth. As much as dysfunctional they were, there were other ways, easy and harmless, to deal with this situation. What started out well turned into a fantasy and a routine that drove each other crazy. And it seemed that April had an idea to make things right again, and it even touched Frank's heart, but their stubbornness and the great idea of leaving only made things worse. The sad thing about it is that someone whose mind what as troubled as their marriage was, was more intelligent to see the real thing. Once they were confronted, things got out of control. I don't know what drives a marriage to end up hurting each other the way they did. How they never thought of any word before saying it. I think that April married Frank as an escape of her failed career. Too bad it was too late for forgiveness. I haven't read the book, but the movie was fantastic. The score might be a little repetitive but it fits the story perfectly and you just can't forget the great supporting cast.",pos
Revolutionary Road,The worst movie,10/2/2019,s2423027,1-二月-09,"We are not able to understand contents of this movie.We were very boring and sleepy.We thought that only a name of Leo and Kate seemed to be the charm of this movie.We were not able to see the development of the story of this movie till the last. I did not think that I wanted to watch it once anymore. I watched Titanic on a previous day.And I expected it very much, and I watched this movie on the next day. I was disappointed.I feel very sorry when I watch this movie after having watched Titanic or while thinking of Titanic. I went to look with a boyfriend, but he said that the choice of this movie was a mistake. I do not want to become the couple of the position whom 2 played even if I marry.

Revolutionary Road,No MMMovieMMMagic here!,10/3/2019,MMMovieMMMagic,26-一月-09,"As far as entertainment goes, this isn't it. Michael Shannon does a great job of playing the mentally disturbed friend and Kate Winslet is great as the psychotic house wife but the entire story is boring and virtually unwatchable. I would rate this as slightly above ""The Hours"" as one of the least entertaining Oscar nominated movies I've ever watched. As I try to see more of the Oscar nominated movies prior to the event, I hope to watch many who are more deserving of the recognition.

I can not believe that IMDb users actually rate this movie as a 7/8 out of 10, only reasoning I can use to justify such a rating would be that people are using an Oscar nod as justification to have to like this film. Either that or those who didn't like it didn't want to waste the time writing a review.

Revolutionary Road,Less Than Meets The Eye,10/5/2019,bob_gilmore1,2-一月-09,"While the film has all of the trappings of Oscar gold including a large marketing campaign, a top shelf cast and Golden Globe nominations it fails the biggest test: Watchability. After an intriguing first half hour the film seems to slip into a predictable pattern and by the end that pattern has worn out its welcome.

Director Sam Mendes is no stranger to marital drama. He swept the Oscars with ""American Beauty"" a film that made Kevin Spacey a star and was extremely accurate at mining the contradictions of upper middle class domestic bliss. The wild success of ""Desperate Housewives"" owes more than a small debt to that film. His follow-up ""Road To Perdition"" broadened the scope but at its heart was a study of the family. Turning his focus to a popular and critically acclaimed novel I must say that he falls flat this time despite the efforts of DeCaprio and Winslett, the pair that hold the record for the most successful box office champion of all time.

""Road"" is set in about the same time period as AMC's critically acclaimed ""Mad Men"" and is about a couple approaching their 10th anniversary. They live in a nice house and have two darling kids and are friends with other couples. The film suggests that according to the standards of the current zeitgeist they should be happy and content. But the script suggests that the pair once believed that they were ""special"" above the milieu of everyday life. Unforetunately there seems to be very little that is ""special"" about them unless you consider the husband's extramarital affairs at work or what would appear to be the increasing erratic behavior of his wife to fall into any ex halted category.

At first the aggressive banter between the pair seems jarring and somewhat unique if not totally captivating. But precious little happens in the story and we are left to chew on basically two performers showing us all of their chops and if we can draw anything from the finished product it may be that either Mendes is not that great of a director or maybe that these movie stars are not great movie artists at least not good enough to carry an entire film without any real support. DeCaprio seemed to blow away his detractors with his stunning work in ""The Departed"" but in retrospect the kudos may actually belong with Scorsese who helmed that project. I guess that everyone will draw their own conclusion but my guess is that simple deduction would place the blame on the performers.

The glowing reviews, award nominations and the cast will most likely bring the public in to see the film but my guess is that this Road will end up being less traveled than others.",neg
Revolutionary Road,A Second Exceptional Family Drama from Mendes,10/9/2019,scrabbarista,30-十二月-08,"Sam Mendes should be pre-emptively awarded a Best Director nomination in any year he releases a film. Through four movies, he's the only director working today who has yet to make a movie that's less than a minor classic, though his dark sensibility admittedly makes his films difficult to watch repeatedly.

In Revolutionary Road, Di Caprio and Winslet give believable, fully human performances in the challenging roles of Frank and April Wheeler, a young couple struggling with their own lack of belief in the life they've chosen. The film shows beautifully, and often painfully, how every moment in life offers a crucial choice, and how the results of these choices can surprise and even devastate. The most impressive thing about RR is the weight and consequence imbued in the life of an ""average, suburban American family"" - the same weight each of us feels in our own lives. Di Caprio and Winslet deserve at least as much credit as Mendes for this, and all three are worthy of Oscar nominations.

From an artistic perspective, I would rank this as Mendes' ""worst"" movie, but the faults in the editing and script are so minor that were this any other director, they might not even be noticeable. All told, Revolutionary Road is a unique addition to the oeuvre of a young and already canonical director.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A Modern Streetcar Named Desire,10/9/2019,chicagopoetry,27-十二月-08,"Revolutionary Road is about as good as family drama gets. Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have wonderful chemistry, although in this case their chemistry is the formula to nitro glycerin. Seven Pounds attempted to bring us to tears with multiple manipulative tricks, but Revolutionary Road actually does it with a simple story, well acted, about a troubled marriage. The theme is the paths we take, why we choose them, and the chances we are given, whether we recognize them or not. This is a pure emotional roller coaster ride, as classic as A Streetcar Named Desire or Goodbye Columbus. Too bad it's not released yet, because DiCaprio certainly would be among Sean Penn and Frank Langella in the running for Best Actor Oscar, and Winslet would have taken Best Actress. The part of the lunatic neighbor was a bit overacted, which is the one and only reason I knocked a point off the perfect ten this movie otherwise deserves.

Revolutionary Road,A wonderful achievement.,10/10/2019,Jennifer-Coen,26-十二月-08,"I was completely blown away at how brilliant the film turned out to be. It's my kind of film and I knew that I'd enjoy it, but it was more than just an enjoyment. It was a special cinematic experience that only a handful of films have provided for me. The very beginning started off the brilliance. The music, how April and Frank's first meeting at the party blended into Frank watching April in the play, the haunting argument during the ride home. The direction was fantastic. I love the fact that Mendes chose to shoot the film in sequence because I could just feel the characters' frustration growing and growing, everything getting worse and worse. The way Frank and April literally transformed in front of my eyes was perfect.

Speaking of Frank and April, DiCaprio and Winslet nailed the characters without any faltering or faults. Both of them were phenomenal. The facial expressions, the gestures and the line delivery were all spot on. DiCaprio was excellent - the amount of range that he showed, even just with his face, throughout the entire film was wonderful. He grasped the character perfectly and nailed every scene. One of his best scenes was when he finds the syringe in the bathroom and the entire argument that follows is perfect. He shines as Frank Wheeler - I saw expressions on his face that I've never seen before. He balanced the subtle moments, the frustration, the powerful yelling, and at times he didn't even have to speak. His eyes are so expressive. Leo truly unleashed Frank, layer by layer. It was so amazing to watch him bring this character to life perfectly.

Kate Winslet is just breathtaking. I thought she was naturally subtle and haunting from beginning to end - when April proposes the idea of going to Paris for the first time, I could just feel her nearly bursting with excitement. This was a possibility of a lifetime for her, she actually was certain that she and Frank would start living again and then the whole chance smashes to pieces. I thought Kate was consistent throughout the film, and she shines even more in the second half which really just haunted me. Winslet shows layers of herself that I've never seen before, expressions on her face that I haven't seen before. She gave me the chills at times, for instance when April runs into the forest after the argument with Frank and we just see her lurking around in the dark from Frank's perspective. The transition into the next morning when she fights to hold her emotions back when she's making breakfast for Frank before he heads off to work was perfect. The scene that probably got to me the most was April's phone call to Milly just before the abortion, when she doesn't want her kids to come to the phone. She wants them to stay outside and continue playing happily, and then struggling to say 'I love them'. Winslet grasps the difficulty of trying so hard to mutter those words and I could feel her frustration. Extraordinary performance.

The two of them together was even more powerful. Their chemistry was so smooth and perfect. Their interactions during the arguments were quite bone chilling and haunting.

Michael Shannon also wowed the hell out of me. It's such an intriguing performance and when he's on screen, you can't take your eyes of him. He commands your attention and he was haunting. All of this just in, what, 2 scenes? His line delivery gave me the chills. Kathy Bates didn't have that much to do, but she was great and she fit the cheery yet worried as hell Mrs. Givings. David Harbour was pretty good as Shep and Kathryn Hann was solid.

The screenplay was wonderful but a few of the lines were kind of forced in a way. The actors handled those lines well though. Technically the film is beautiful. Thomas Newman never disappoints and he sure as hell didn't here. What a stunning score. The best track I think was during the whole forest scene, and when Frank is frantically waiting inside for April at night. Gorgeous cinematography as well, and Deakins also never disappoints.

I recommend this film to everyone. It's such an astonishing cinematic experience.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Watch it to believe the real revolution of life... such a intriguing movie!,10/7/2019,rushatiu,12-五月-12,"It's very unfortunate of me that I actually did not get the opportunity to watch it on its first day's first release at any multiplex. But no regret cause I own a DVD of the movie. Initially, I wanted to watch the movie for the Caprio-Winslet pair. Later, as the movie proceeded further, I found myself totally engrossed by the movie. Brilliant convincing performance from both,Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio,actually took away the fact that am not watching anything of drama genre but a reality.It was expected.The background score also perfectly mingled with the flow of the movie. Overall, the movie made me cry. It's a very thought provoking movie and somewhere anyone would connect with himself/herself that sometimes boredom and drudgery of life make one person irrational, he/she wants to break free from the usual cycle. But maximum time it doesn't happen. In a way, it takes a toll not only on body but also mind. In the end, all I can say Go Watch it and see the reflection of your life.The road of our lives is truly 'revolutionary'.

Revolutionary Road,Don't bother,10/3/2019,keith-618,16-九月-10,"Sorry, I don't get it. This is not a great movie. It is not even a good movie. Sure it's well acted; both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio give well crafted performances. And it's shot well; there are some great visual moments in the movie. But as a piece of narrative it's dull and pointless. Who cares? The Wheelers are merely an ordinary, if attractive, dysfunctional couple. She's selfish and unfulfilled, he's less selfish and unfulfilled. They love. They fight. So what! But then, an interesting character, John Givings, the supposedly retarded son of the neighbours appears - ah! this could lead us somewhere - but sadly not. And, the music by Thomas Newman (whose work I normally admire) was so simple and repetitive as to become irritating.

Revolutionary Road,Thin Line b/w Love & Hate,10/10/2019,Anabll310,15-十二月-08,"This movie is amazing! It is intense but it touches on a universal topic, relationships. If you expect to watch a beautiful love story this is the opposite of that. I agree Kate's and Leo's performance is beyond great. There are scenes that are silent and you can still feel the intensity of their acting. But there are a couple of arguments/fights that Kate and Leo have that are breath taking. Sam Mendes also did an excellent job directing, there is one scene where their having dinner with Kathy Bates and her son, I won't ruin it for you, but all I have to say is that Sam has an amazing eye b/c that scene has to be by far one of the best, the directing and acting was phenomenal.Overall the entire cast was good and the movie is excellent, I just cant stop thinking about it, but the only problem now is that I'm scared as hell of marriage. =)

Revolutionary Road,"Abused, psichologically",10/7/2019,lovaszi-peter,23-六月-18,"An outstanding drama demonstrating an awfully common problem of our society, which often isn't being recognised by the suffering party. The drama has 3 main characters - April (Kate Winslet) the housewife, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), the main character and will talk about the third one later.

If you experience anything what you've seen in the movie, you are psychologically abused and should see someone specialised immediately. Frank personalises the perfect abusive husband who knows all the trick how he can terrorise April without ever hurting her physically. But she doesn't give up, tries to change their life entirely, Frank gives the hope, agrees with April, but when he has to do action, he finds excuses every time. And again and again so he can let April down. Well, this is not the first one of its subject. The third main character is John (Michael Shannon), who says out loudly the truth and is intelligent enough to analyse the main characters psychologically - ironically he is considered psychopath for doing it so in this 1950's society.

Overall it is a good movie representing important values, but not an easy watch. You might get confused about April's personality and behaviour, which demonstrates how much she suffers due to the abuse she has to take.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Is it over yet?,10/2/2019,joneskeller07,8-五月-18,"I can't count how many times I stopped this film to check Facebook. That's how unnecessary a film it was to me.

Revolutionary Road,I Rarely Review Films...,10/10/2019,debrahnava-52496,13-三月-18,"But felt compelled on this 1. What a beautifully made story of the pressures of marriage, children and family. Making what seems to be an easy decision to live the life of a suburban family isn't always so easy. Society seems to idealize family life to the point of ad of naseum. Some people are just more bohemian and flighty by nature. When these people try to mold themselves into what they think society wants them to be - it can result in disaster for all involved. Never have I seen a movie portray this more accuratelty than Revolutionary Road. I've seen it several times and each time it moves me to tears. Every actor, especially Kate & Leo, are simple magnificent. Albeit a bit sad & depressing, don't miss this film because of this. Reveal in the beauty and understatement of this perfect film.

Revolutionary Road,"Not revolutionary, but very powerful and moving",10/9/2019,TheLittleSongbird,25-一月-17,"That 'Revolutionary Road' was directed by Sam Mendes (who directed the brilliant 'American Beauty' nine years earlier) and that it reunited two immensely talented actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet after 1997's 'Titanic' were reasons enough to see it.

'Revolutionary Road' may not be ""revolutionary"" and it is not perhaps a film that will be re-watched over and over by me. This said, there is so much to appreciate, there is no denying that it's incredibly well made and superbly acted. And to me and many others (though it is an understandably polarising film, the dark and unpleasant subject matter is not for everybody) it is a powerful and moving film, and one of the most realistic and truthful depictions of a struggling marriage on film.

Visually, 'Revolutionary Road' is wonderfully shot, bleak but also sumptuous, while the scenery and 50s production values are evocatively and handsomely rendered. Thomas Newman's music score is hauntingly hypnotic, achingly melancholic and at times ominous.

While at times stagy, the dialogue is insightful, making one really think about what it's saying (it has much to say and knows how to say it without preaching) and for many will wrench the gut and induce floods of tears. There is a little levity provided by Kathy Bates, that could have been ill-fitting but is pitched well. The story is deliberate, but the atmosphere is brilliantly evoked and there are many parts that have huge power and are emotionally devastating, especially in the latter parts.

Sam Mendes keeps things at an assured pace, keeps the atmosphere alive and doesn't undermine the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet in any way. DiCaprio and Winslet embody their roles, which are intentionally not the most likable, are very complex and very much compellingly real, and their chemistry is both tense and affecting. Winslet has the more complex one of the two and her performance is a heart-wrenching emotional roller-coaster, while DiCaprio gives an explosive turn especially in the fever pitch latter parts.

Michael Shannon proves himself to be a scene stealer as the brutally honest crazy nut, and Kathy Bates brings well-timed levity.

Overall, a powerful and moving film that is highly appreciated in many ways. 9/10 Bethany Cox",pos
Revolutionary Road,Terrible - Avoid this bomb!,10/2/2019,jb_campo,23-一月-16,"Revolutionary Road stinks. The story was stupid. The acting was so-so. The dialog was asinine. The music was terrible too -this little jingle going on in the background to what, ramp up the drama? Please.

My wife loves Leonardo and these types of movies usually, but even she was begging me to Fast Forward thru this mess.

I can't even begin to tell you in detail how terrible this movie is. It seems that the Producers wanted to capitalize on a Titanic reunion of Dicaprio and Winslet, mixing in the odd storyline of this bomb, thinking that Sam Mendes could work his American Beauty masterpiece.

Do Not Be Deceived. This movie just sucked. This couple is unhappy. Oh boo hoo, he has to commute to work each day. He didn't want to do what his father did, and that is where he is. Kate Winslet does nothing, and complains about it, so hey, let's move somewhere different. Then the idiotic sex scenes, awkward pauses, strange blow ups by various people, odd neighbors, all done with the 1950s look, and hey, you have a winner - give me a break. How Winslet was able to keep herself from laughing at her stupid lines is a miracle. Dicaprio had to really blow up a few times, but it just seemed forced, and like I said, stupid.

I would give this a 0 rating except for the fact that the costumes/background effectively evoked the era, and that they convinced two fine actors to waste their time with this mess.

Do not go down Revolutionary Road. It is a disaster.",neg
Revolutionary Road,It Takes Real Guts to See the Hopelessness,10/7/2019,ThomasDrufke,23-六月-15,"We all know the pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic proved to be one of the most beloved romances in all of cinema, but if you are expecting more of the same, I would advise against watching Revolutionary Road. But the reality is, the film is very well made, and very telling of how the suburban 50's life might have been back in the day. But much like some other Oscar bait movies, Revolutionary Road is a film you definitely have to be in the right mood to enjoy, and is likely a film you wont ever want to watch again.

The film begins with the two meeting in a clichéd bar setting, but we really didn't even need that. Their relationship and history with each other is easily bought into. The two have simply some of the best chemistry between love interests we have ever had in cinema, whether it be a pleasant scene, or an overly dramatic one. The film does a good job of making you feel for the couple and their struggle to continue their marriage and raise their kids while also going through difficulties with DiCaprio's job. Both characters flaws are represented and in a way that doesn't necessarily make either more likable than the other. I think it's a tribute to both of these brilliant actors that they can make each and every one of the dramatic scenes (there's a ton) feel real and natural. The film flows in a way that you know where the characters are probably heading, you just don't want to believe it just yet.

The film centers on Frank's (Dicaprio) inability to want to try something new and his fear of failing. Failure never ruins someone, it's being afraid to fail that leads to their downfall. I thought that was well represented throughout the film. It's worth mentioning Michael Shannon's brief but important role in the film, and the impact that his character has on the rest of the film. To me, he served as the speaker of the audience's thoughts and opinions on these shells of human beings, for the most part. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the film enough to be noticeable, but there is an overwhelming amount of darkness and sadness that is pulled from the film. Like I said, it's a very good film, but it's just extremely difficult to watch.

+Both actors chemistry

+Beautiful to look at

+Look inside the 50's

-Sooooo dark and depressing

Revolutionary Road,"Certainly Something Missing,",10/7/2019,lesleyharris30,6-二月-15,"Revolutionary Road is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is certainly a well acted movie,though it is certainly not their finest performances,Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both shine in the lead roles,and their acting has certainly improved over the eleven year gap of Titanic,both movies contain great chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet,but this time around it felt more real and sincere.I felt like there were certainly several things missing than could have made this movie better,one thing is that it certainly would have benefited with making us feel for these characters more,I found them quite unlikable for the most part,and at times that certainly made it difficult for me to care about the decisions they make or the things that happen to them.I also think it needed more scenes containing intense dialogue between the Wheeler's,these parts were the highlight of the movie as Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver their dialogue beautifully.Its certainly not outstanding and could have benefited more from its two leads,but Revolutionary Road is still a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or romantic film.

A seemingly successful couple in 1950s Connecticut struggle to fight off the boredom and resentment their marriage is facing.

Revolutionary Road,Surreal,10/10/2019,gemini_dremz,31-一月-14,"Revolutionary Road depicts the story of a 1950's married couple who, by all appearances are the ideal couple. However there are underlying problems in the relationship. Intriguing are the routine lives they all lived, in a Stepford Wives sort of way; like when Frank Wheeler's waiting for the train with what looks like 100's of his clones. His wife April is the typical 50's housewife. She reminisces of the time she and Frank met and how much she loved him and how she wanted that back. At this point things are so routine she desires a change or to feel alive again. Frank sleeps with a secretary in an attempt to also feel alive. April tries to liven things up by suggesting that they move to France; Frank once told her how people are more lively there. She talks about working and while Frank studies. They tell their friends about their plans, but they don't understand why they would want to move. Oddly enough the only one who is supportive, is John Givings (son of Helen, the Realtor who sold the Wheeler's their home), who was released from a mental hospital. While packing, April tells Frank she's ten weeks pregnant and that she has two more weeks to take care of it. Shortly thereafter he sees an apparatus used for abortions in their bathroom closet and confronts her about it. She advises him it's the best thing they could do with the trip nearing and for saving money, but he's against it. Frank is then offered a promotion but turns it down then later accepts it causing things to unravel. April realizes she is stuck in this fast track to nowhere and ends up sleeping with the neighbor Shep Campbell. Her and Frank fight and she tells him she hates him, he confesses about the other woman, but April is numb she doesn't care; she doesn't confess about Shep. Frank cannot believe his wife isn't happy with all they have and say the whole France thing was a childish idea to begin with. The argument escalates and he tells her he wishes she had gotten an abortion. She's devastated and runs into the woods with Frank following, but she wants to be alone to think. He drinks himself to sleep and when he awakens, she's cooking breakfast, looking as lovely as ever and being very pleasant, Frank is taken back by this, but is very pleased. She asks about his work and he smiles. You can see by his expression that he's so happy that she's interested in his work and illustrates, on a napkin, how a this particular piece of equipment works. When she says she's not sure she sees what he means, he looks disappointed, but perks back up when she says she does in fact see. She boosts his ego even more by telling him he should keep doing what he's doing because he's ""obviously good at it"". Before he leaves, he tells her how pleasant their breakfast was and asks if she hates him; she tells him no and assures him she still loves him. As he walks toward his car, she stands, loyally, on the doorstep watching him; he turns, smiles and waves. She waves back and watches him leave. Upon returning to clean the dishes, she bursts into tears. It's as if she knows she can no longer pretend to be someone she is not and continue this charade. She calls a friend and asks if they could bring the children back in the evening. Then April goes upstairs and pulls the abortion apparatus out of her vanity drawer. She removes her shoes and skit and closes the bathroom door. We then see her descend the stairs, barefooted, take each step carefully. She walks to the living room window and stares out at the sunny day as if things seem clearer to her; then you see the blood dripping on the carpet. The camera widens and you see her blood stained skirt and then hear her on the phone asking for help. The next scene we see Shep show up at the hospital and Frank is already there; he is crying and distressed. He tells Shep what the Dr.'s have told him and then says ""she did this to herself""; meaning she hurt herself. Shep goes to get coffee but just cries to himself before returning with the coffee, but when he does, Frank is coming out of the OR with a look of shock; April died. Of course everyone on Revolutionary Road goes on with life as usual. The Wheeler's are mentioned from time to time, but no one really wants to talk about them. Ironically, Frank moved to the city with his children and found another job. When April was alive he wasn't going to leave and tried to convince her that their life was wonderful, but after the tragedy, that all changed and he ended up leaving anyway. This made me think of all the couples who were and probably still live this way. As dismal as this film is, it really makes you think about one's own life and whether it's truly fulfilling or just an emotionless routine. I highly recommend it as it flows nicely without boredom and the setting really takes you back in time. I especially loved the clothing; it was a time when men and women took pride in their appearance and always looked their best. There's just a few cuss words, but that's it, even the sex scenes are done tastefully. The acting was phenomenal; particularly Kate Winslet's. I loved Michael Shannon's role as John, Leonardo DiCaprio's role wasn't as intriguing, but that doesn't take away from his performance; he's great in all he does.",pos
Revolutionary Road,The heart wrenching saga of the Wheelers..,10/8/2019,eastwood-azad,16-三月-12,"Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road"" is the story of a dysfunctional, imperfect married couple who are frustrated with the way things have turned out for them. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) are in an unhappy mess of a marriage that seems to be going nowhere, with frequent quarrels and whimsically made decisions.

""Revolutionary Road"" raises a bunch of questions that will completely change the way we look at relationships. Are people really made for each other? If yes, then do they always find the right person for themselves? And what about those who wrongly end up being with each other?

Frank and April are a couple who've tread past a path they cannot retrace, they have had two children, but they still don't seem to connect with each other and they don't really understand what they want.

Leonardo and Kate prove that two characters who don't love each other or relate to each other can still have a strong, ironic and cold chemistry between them.

The film is a two hour condensation of a 1961 novel which aimed at portraying the dark, harsh reality of a suburban marriage in the Fifties. A tragedy, undoubtedly, ""Revolutionary Road"" hits you very hard as a brutal depiction of a sorrowful American relationship.

The final few moments of the film makes us think back and analyze the life these two people had together. Were they supposed to be together? No. Why did they have to be together, then? The answer to that, like in all tragedies, will never be known.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Cracking Performance from Winslet.,10/9/2019,gashmanflirty,9-七月-11,"I will be to the point in this review. Firstly i would admit approaching this film that i had hesitation in watching it because of the storyline. It came across as not having the ingredients to wow me. I felt that it might become slow and fade out.

However the result couldn't be further away. The performance from Kate Winslet i can without hesitation say was Oscar winning. It was immaculate. The way she portrayed the different emotions of the character was done fabulously well. Credit has to be given to the director, writer and screen play individual(s). I have seen Kate on a couple of times ( The Reader) leading to me resolve that she is a powerful female actor especially in the genre's of drama's & romantic/ sexually orientated deep movies.

Leonardo did OK/ good. The reason i rate him in this movie at a moderate level is because his character someone what infuriated me on occasions. There are times in the movie when situations escalate into unnecessary outburst & situations. This happened on a frequent occasions here if he had held back his tongue the result would of been better.

The soundtrack & its undertones i was really impressed by. It allowed the movie to flow and give continuity. This worked really well with the picture. The picture was of a really high quality. Looking at the budget of $35 for a drama such as this which would lead me to think that was a lot of money spent, it was obviously put to good use as nearly all the scenes were pretty much perfect.

The addition of the character of the character's Michael Shannnan definitely added that extra broadened input that elevated the movie. Moreover for him to feature in so little of the film (2 scenes ), and receive an Oscar nomination shows that his input was effective. In my opinion what he did for the film was to allow the character to become even more deeper about there emotions and expressing. FINALLY- the one bad thing about this movie was the ending. It should of ended with Di caprio running down the road (roll in the credits). The small extension i have to enthasise was absolutely unnecessary.

On the whole the story line and its fantasying points really created and excellent film to watch. It was definitely on about Di Caprio and Winselt. The storyline mentions the kids but don't really impact on the viewing. Its the relationship between the two main characters. Additionally in that respect the characters on the side like the house woman - 'Kathy Bates ' aide in the movies success but more over the whole theme and flowing of it. So yeh watch, give it a chance and you'll say yeh Oscar performance from Winslet and it was a good watch. Although not a fantastic it movie- it does not slow down in it's pace. And this avoided what i feared at the start.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Thought provoking,10/9/2019,fionainns,29-四月-11,"Having only just got round to watching this on DVD I am impressed. It's funny, thought provoking, emotional, intelligent and touching in all the right amounts and will ring true to many people who have been married for several years and are 'searching' for something else. Sam Mendes does a fantastic job of directing and the film is beautifully shot with amazing lighting in many of the scenes. In fact it's the setting itself that gives the intensity to much of the film with the house and Frank's job been oppressive to the point where the viewer is desperate for them both to escape. DiCaprio and Winslet are sublime and their chemistry sizzles on screen. The supporting cast are fabulous with Michael Shannon stealing his scenes as the son of Mrs Givings. All through this film you feel the quiet desperation of a couple who love and loathe each other at the same time and who don't know how to resolve either one of those things. The ending is as the rest of the film is, a look at life and how it has to continue under any circumstances and the final scene is a fitting tribute to marriages who make it and a nod to how they do that - in fact it made me smile.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road is like a psychoanalysis of our mundane lives.,10/8/2019,Eternality,11-四月-11,"Sam Mendes' journey as a film director comes full circle with his latest feature - Revolutionary Road, a motion picture that paints a bleak portrait of the American suburban life; a theme he has explored in his debut Oscar-winning film, American Beauty (1999) before embarking on a creative curve with acclaimed films such as the crime drama Road To Perdition (2002), and the biographical war picture Jarhead (2005). The British filmmaker returns to what he does best, weaving a story around drama-centric performances that open the window to human nature.

Since James Cameron's Titanic (1997), Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, Gangs Of New York) and Kate Winslet (Little Children, The Reader) have embarked on envious, ambitious acting careers, establishing themselves as A-list actors whom are not afraid of tackling demanding dramatic roles. In Revolutionary Road, they are reunited as the Wheelers, lovers in a marriage which from a blissful start becomes increasingly strained along the way.

Their performances are a standout. Individually, they give commanding displays that are unfortunately not recognized by the Academy. But it is their performances collectively that is more impressive; their screen- friendly chemistry still remains after more than a decade. The star of the supporting cast is Michael Shannon, whose character John is a recently-discharged-mental-patient-who-obviously-has-not-recovered neighbor whose occasional awkward visits to the Wheelers together with his parents bring more grief and anger than jubilation.

There is a spectacular dramatic set-piece in the second half of the film that pits John against the Wheelers in a furious war of words. Although viewers are able to see it coming, the build-up to the film is extraordinary. Prior to John's visit, the Wheelers have a massively intense quarrel over marital issues which are interrupted by the visitors. Thus, the mood is set brilliantly for an inevitable bitter exchange of words of volcanic proportions.

For almost a decade, Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (Wall.E, Finding Nemo) has had a strong contribution towards the aural look of Mendes' pictures. In this film, the score is less distinct, but it is no less Mendes-resque. The last sequence casts a shadow of gloom and offers no glimmer of optimism, which means the film has the potential to end powerfully. However, it is not executed well enough to bring a satisfactory sense of closure to the lives of these people.

Revolutionary Road is like a psychoanalysis of our mundane lives. Well for most of us. While it may not showcase Mendes in top form, the film's intention is clear and it leaves us with a sour aftertaste: Are we too good for anybody?

Revolutionary Road,"Uneven performances and dialogue, but solid overall",10/7/2019,matrioshka,16-一月-11,"The story is complex, emotional, multi-layered, and quite smart. Unfortunately it does not always translate in the acting, dialogue, or even the setting of the shot. I like all the actors in this movie, but sometimes Leo and Kate deliver their lines as two actors on the stage in a local production - just not convincing enough. The dialogue sometimes is too predictable, with flatness both in words and delivery. However, neither of these are so often as to ruin the movie. So overall the effect is still impressive. Michael Shannon is the only one deserving real praise - and rightly getting nominated for Oscar. A solid performer, but won't be remembered several years down the road, and is NOT the best of the decade.

Revolutionary Road,Great Movie: Beats going to a marriage counselor.,10/8/2019,erniep5,15-一月-10,"The agony of being trapped in a situation with neither party unable to make the adult decision.

I bet couples who were married in the 50's had to do a lot of soul searching after seeing this movie. It was a different time (1955) so choices were limited and society was strict on what you can and cannot do.

Makes you wonder if people actually stay together out of love or out of necessity.

Also, it makes you wonder if the same is true even in the 21st century.

Relationships are TOUGH.

Revolutionary Road,A film that becomes Reality after a while....,10/9/2019,namashi_1,7-一月-10,"Based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, Filmmaker Sam Mendes brings us 'Revolutionary Road', a film that becomes Reality after a while. Astounding!

'Revolutionary Road' is different, very different. At a running time of 113-minutes, this film grows on you & the intense moments look as if they are going on near you. I have never let a film grow on me, but Sam Mendes, this son of a gun... did that! When the end-credits rolled, I then realized that I am indeed watching a movie, I was left awe-struck.

As this is a film, apart from the high-class direction, every other department is flawless. Coming to the acting department, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver bravura performances. Kate is astounding. She's so real. Leo is fantastic from start to end. Michael Shannon is outstanding. An Icredible Actor! Kathy Bates, Richard Easton & Zoe Kazan are good. David Harbour is excellent. Kathryn Hahn is passable.

A 9/10 rating, because this ended up being a movie, not something going-on near my eyes.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Brilliant Film - Anyone in a long term relationship can relate to,10/10/2019,dfrbrowne,6-一月-10,"All I can say is that anyone giving this film a bad review, may be to young to understand the relationship on screen or fails to understand that the film portrays a very real insight into a lot of marriages. Anyone who has been married for a few years with kids or been through a divorce will relate to the Wheelers. Its a painful watch and an insight. I am sure that an awful lot of married couples came away from this film thinking ""its not just us"" fights and arguments are a consequence of any long term commitment, its how we deal with them that matters. A superb film and I found the two hours to be over too soon. What do we get at the very end when we see the old couple - a perfect conclusion! If you've been married that long its just easier to cope if you switch off.

Revolutionary Road,"Absorbing, But Depressing",10/8/2019,crossbow0106,30-十二月-09,"There is no denying the chemistry that exists between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. As a suburban married couple in Long Island in the 40's, you are immediately a voyeur in their life. The emotions in this film run the gamut. You have to give Winslet & DiCaprio credit for not going the total commercial route. The film is bathed in soft colors and the direction is top notch. That being said, this is not necessarily a happy story. Anyone who watched ""Titanic"" and feels they are going to replay that film will be disappointed. Ms. Winslet deserves the accolades she received for her portrayal, she is wonderful. Watch this film to see two A list actors work magic. Although it is depressing, it is worthwhile.

Revolutionary Road,Start this Revolution Without Me **1/2,10/6/2019,edwagreen,28-十二月-09,"Despite the incredibly fine acting by Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, this picture is nothing more than ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? of this century.

Frank and April are anything but love-birds. They're just great at tormenting each other as we see in two major screaming scenes.

The name April to me represents spring and the coming of flowers. April Wheeler as depicted by Kate Winslet is anything but that. She is a frustrated woman who thinks that by moving to Paris with Frank (DiCaprio) and their two children, they can start life anew. She defies the conventional times of the 1950s by saying that she will work in Paris while Frank gets the time to find himself. He loathes his job.

Complications derail their plan when Frank is offered a promotion and April becomes pregnant.

Something is terribly wrong when an emotionally disturbed man, the son of real estate person Kathy Bates, has the situation terribly correct. Is this a one flew over the cuckoo's nest syndrome? Bates looks like a typical elementary school principal of that period. She pretends to be friendly but inwardly harbors resentment towards the Wheelers.

The film is basically devoid of the true meaning of life. In fact, it seems to attack that very idea.

The fact remains that April Wheeler wouldn't attain happiness if she were in Paris, Shangri La or on the beach in Honolulu.

Remember when Bogie said to Bergman in Casablanca, ""We always had Paris?"" That great city is not the answer here.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Convincing. A very nice work From Sam Mendes,10/9/2019,barrys82,2-三月-09,"Revolutionary Road a movie about A young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during the mid-1950s struggle to come to terms with their personal problems while trying to raise their two children. Directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), this is an all drama movie that reflects the emptiness that some people have for not fulfilling their dreams in life and the desperate measures that it may provoke. The story is interesting, the plot is very well developed, it is very good set on the 50's era. It has a slow paced rhythm, you have to focus and have patience or you'll get bored. The cast is very good. In the leading roles we have Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler respectively, both deliver very good performances specially Winslet, DiCaprio was a little overacted for my taste. Kathy Bates as Helen Givings gives us an excellent work and Michael Shannon as John Givings was so convincing that he earned himself an Academy award nomination.

Revolutionary Road,"intense, raw, painful and brutally honest",10/9/2019,jemps918,2-三月-09,"Frank: I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! April: It takes backbone to lead the life you want!

Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) works for the first time with his wife Kate Winslet in Revolutionary Road, a heavy drama based on Richard Yates' novel. It also reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Winslet since 1997's Titanic.

Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) seem to live the perfect life with their two kids in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Frank has a job he doesn't like but is good at, while April put her acting dreams on hold to become a full-time housewife. But they feel trapped and unhappy and feel like there is a better life than what they have. Then April hatches the perfect plan: the Wheelers will start over in Paris, the only place she remembers her husband saying was worth returning to, where people felt most alive. No job awaits Frank there, in fact, he has no idea what he will do, but he will finally have the time to find out. April volunteers to support the family by applying for a good-paying secretarial job. They announce their plan to the world, but when they begin execution, complications ensue, values are tested, and the couple discovers so much more about each other that will forever change their future.

Revolutionary Road is intense, raw, painful and brutally honest. It has been called a humorless American Beauty, but it's so much more. It may be set in the '50s, but its message continues to speak to anyone in a relationship today. Technically, while the performances were terrific, it sometimes felt like the characters were mouthpieces on a tableau, as if in a play. But that itch aside, Revolutionary Road resonated with me, being in a relationship and having had the same thoughts as the characters. When April says, ""I saw a whole other future. I can't stop seeing it,"" you feel her desire and grief. You will also feel Frank's helplessness even in his volatile explosions. Even in their many conversations and yelling sprees, one might think that at least the couple communicates and are honest with each other. But in the end, there is a scene that at first confused me, but later on I realized its importance: how a couple lasts by showing how the other copes. It was a simple but powerful scene, perhaps depressing but real nonetheless.",pos
Revolutionary Road,An Honest and Intelligent Movie.,10/10/2019,jinmo2007-1,28-二月-09,"This is an honest, intelligent, and thought-provoking movie, well-directed and edited even though perhaps a little overacted. This movie is about a middle-class couple whose high aspirations and dreams are not backed by commensurate real talent. The story is repeated in every suburb, every generation, all over the world..... People who are smart and ambitious sometimes attempt to compensate their lack of real talent with peculiarity. April is such a case. The misfortune of April is that an even nuttier stranger (the realty agent's son)came into the picture and pushed her nuttiness over the edge...

I commend the production for not succumbing to the all too obvious temptation to turn the movie into let's-make-money ""suburban Titanic II.""

Revolutionary Road,Where is the love ...,10/9/2019,MOscarbradley,18-二月-09,"Based on the novel by Richard Yates, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a bleak dissection of a marriage, circa 1955. It is also one of the best movies of the year, a tour-de-force for all concerned. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are April and Frank Wheeler who meet cute, marry and then regret it. They are an idealistic young couple with big ideas, (she aspires to be an actress), who settle for suburbia, the good life and a kind of genteel respectability. They dream of relocating to Paris but it's a pipe-dream from the start and it's April's idea. It is April who seems to be the volatile one, the unhappy one, though it is Frank who plays away. And, of course, they row; the row spectacularly to the point where blood could be drawn.

By now you may have guessed that Frank and April could be the younger versions of Albee's George and Martha, or going back further still, of Strinberg's Edgar and Alice, the only difference being that that they are still young enough to be still in love or, at least, in a form of love, romantic and unrealistic where every wound they inflict on each other is somehow made better by sex. How typical are April and Frank? I mean, how typical are they of their time and place? No-one seems to be happy; not their friends or neighbours, not the guys Frank works with in their dull, successful jobs in this decade of post-war prosperity. ""Revolutionary Road"" is, then, as much a critique of 1950's America, stunningly recreated in Kristi Zea's production design and Albert Wolsky's costumes, as it is a study of a disintegrating relationship.

Doubts, too, as to the suitability of DiCaprio and Winslet to handle such heavy-duty material are dispelled almost immediately. This is acting of the very highest order. Winslet's performance has already been showered with praise and prizes, (between this and ""The Reader"", this has definitely been her year), all thoroughly deserved. She must now rank among the finest actresses of her generation and among the best actresses currently working in international cinema. However, to my mind, Leonardo DiCaprio is even better and his failure to be nominated for the Oscar either speaks volumes as to the superiority of those who have been nominated, (and frankly, I think it is a better performance than Mickey Rourke's in ""The Wrestler"" and it looks like Rourke who will take home the prize), or the complete lack of insight on the part of the Academy who still look on DiCaprio as the boy pretender. He may have started his career as a young Turk, dipped a little in the middle with some dubious career choices, but now seems to have rediscovered his mettle. He just seems to get better with every movie and this is a career-best performance.

The supporting cast, without exception, are all terrific. Invidious, then, to single anyone out but mention must be made of Kathy Bates' real-estate agent, part pre-war dyed-in-the-wool, part post-war forward thinker. For too long Bates has been mired in caricature 'fat' parts so it is nice to see her finally get a role that requires some internal thought. Even better is Michael Shannon as her 'insane' son, let out for the odd afternoon from the institution where he has been receiving electric shock treatment. Like Randall P McMurphy his only crime seems to be that he disagrees with the status quo, (his mother describes him as 'an intellectual'), although his behavior, when invited around for dinner, does seem to contravene the rules of polite society when he attacks his hosts, (and is attacked in return). Shannon is an actor I am not familiar with but on the strength of this performance he is someone I shall be looking out for in the future.

If this, for the most part, extraordinary film does have a fault it lies not in the execution, which is superb, but in the content. No character endears themselves to us and at the heart of the film there is a coldness. What is conspicuously absent is any real feeling, other than a feeling of negativity and disdain. These are not people we would choose as friends or neigbours; to know them certainly isn't to love them and while their fate may be terrible, you tend to think that anything that happens to them is their own sorry fault.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Another Mendes Gem...,10/9/2019,avirup-it,17-二月-09,"Again Sam Mendes .After watched American Beauty I was eagerly waiting for the Revolutionary road.The film is about Wheeler couple who's life not in the track to say least.Firstly I need to confess that I hav'nt read the novel , but still I liked the movie as Dicaprio and Kate Winslet acted superbly.The film is about the life ,rather say the real life with full of dreams ,full of misunderstanding and full of strong incidents.April Wheelers facial expression was out of question , nicely developed and more nicely acted char, who had a dream .... opps I Am not going to discuss any story here.Other side Frank Wheelers (Dicaprio) char was selfish and always fear to loose the love.The char of the mentally retarded person was extraordinary ... who's unknowingly hit some rude but real,bad but truth in the movie.The another thing I must mention is the background music..is so nice and it's haunting music make u feel the gem of the movie.

In fact this is the best drama I have watched of the 2008 movies.Nicely directed ,less words ,more feeling and much more magic expression.A must watch for sure.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Powerfully and compellingly depressing film about the emptiness of Suburbia...,10/8/2019,varundelpiero,17-二月-09,"Sam Mendes, in an effective follow-up of sorts to American BEAUTY (I say follow-up because both films touch on the same subject matter), has created a film that is amazingly realistic and compelling, and examines life in Suburbia to the extent that most directors are afraid to go.

The acting by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is astounding and is reason enough to watch the film. It amazes me how neither of these performances was nominated for Lead Acting Oscars. DiCaprio portrays Frank Wheeler in a powerful yet laid-back manner, while Winslet as April Wheeler is simply stunning. By themselves, they are fantastic, but together they forge a combative and forceful on-screen relationship that is in no way comparable to the overly romantic one seen in 1997's TITANIC. The excellent acting is not only confined within the lead roles, as Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon do more than adequate jobs in their supporting roles. The latter was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

Not much has been said by critics in terms of story/character development, but in my opinion, this is one of the most engrossing films I have seen for the Awards season. Likewise, not enough has been said about the score, which is effectively low-key with a hint of deep-set and ominous gloom; perfect for setting the overall mood of the film as it creates an uneasy atmosphere. The cinematography, camera-work, set design, and costume design were all remarkable, and the viewer would have felt engrossed in the 1960s atmosphere presented.

Overall, a truly captivating Motion Picture; one that should not be missed. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 166. Highly recommended.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Feminist Propaganda.,10/1/2019,peteperl,20-一月-09,"This is one of the worst movies i ever watched. Starting off nice, it soon deconstructs the golden era of the 50ies in which a man was still a man and a woman knew her role until it becomes emancipation propaganda. Kate Winslet playing a badly educated witch in a world full of liars and with a husband without honor and strength. This was the exception back then, 99% of the people lived happily. Who wants to see movies that show life as it should not be, in which you do not feel strong, feel better, look up to. I watch movies to feel better after i watched them, to let them strengthen my values and in the end myself; or to just entertain me. This movie cannot satisfy any of these desires, actually it makes me feel sad, depressed. I can imagine some lesbian feminists or maybe suppressed women may enjoy this movie due to the parallels to their lifes, but that's about it. A waste of Winslets and DiCaprio's acting skills.

Revolutionary Road,The Road to Disappointment,10/7/2019,235SCOPE,30-十一月-08,"How are you going to keep the viewers down in the theaters now that they've seen Mad Men? With pedigree maybe, but maybe not.

Revolutionary Road would have had something new to say two years ago, just before the AMC television series hit the cablewaves. Today, it just feels like we've seen it all before, and much better. Only this time it's said by stars, big stars, three of them reuniting from the one of the biggest movies of all time, throwing their acting around like they're auditioning for Oscar himself. But does that a good film make?

The story of the proverbial ""folks who live on the hill"", whose lives turn out to be much darker than any of their friends and neighbors would imagine, offered many opportunities for departure from past films and television shows. But this new Sam Mendes film does not take advantage of those opportunities and plunges instead down a path of self-destructive discontent that's too much of a predictable standard to feel revolutionary at all.

To make matters worse, this road is loaded with clichés about suburbia, the emptiness of middle-class existence, and the loss of dreams and individuality, all wrapped in the same smoke-booze-and-infidelity excesses as its more sophisticated television sibling.

Leonardo Di Caprio replays the same character we've come accustomed to seeing in his hands, all lava-like intensity and pain behind his child-like face. For my money, he gives an adequate but mostly unmodulated performance that is all tears ready to burst out of his eyes with every marital twist of fate. Weren't those mad men in the 1950's the ultimate experts at keeping it all in? Kate Winslet doesn't fare much better or much worse. But Michael Shannon, in a well-written part, gives the one performance that should be remembered at Oscar time.

Not the best from the director of the impeccable American Beauty. A 6.5 out of 10.",pos
Revolutionary Road,My Personal Problems With Revolutionary Road (Spoilers),10/1/2019,MovieFanGuyy,9-十二月-08,"It seemed to me that April and Frank Wheeler got married just to ""achieve"" the American dream. Then April becomes unhappy with the marriage, and becomes a rather annoying wife, a nagger. Somehow, I just wanted the film to end, I got sick and tired of their bickering, their arguments, and I have seen this setting on AMC's Mad Men dozens of times. Michael Shannon as the neighbor does give an Oscar worthy performance, but I felt it wasn't nearly as good as Mende's earlier film, American Beauty, released nearly a decade ago!

Leonardo DiCaprio does excellent work here, but Kate Winslet, completely overreacts, and I really didn't sympathasize with her selfish decisions in the film. I just wanted these two people to divorce and move on. I really thought this was like two hours of pure torture to watch.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Runaway Road,10/5/2019,thesar-2,29-十二月-08,"Leo and Kate's (and don't forget the wonderful Kathy Bates as well) reunion here in 'Revolutionary Road' from 'Titanic' reminded me so much of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts's 'Pretty Woman' follow-up/reunion 'Runaway Bride.' In both cases, the originals they starred in were incredibly better and the latter films weren't complete disappointments, just not as great. Here we have Leo acting like Leo, but much better is Kate who shows so much depth to the lost housewife of the fifties who realized what little anyone else that lived in the area/time either saw or talked about: the 'Stepford Wives' effect. Of course, I'm not talking about robots, but they might as well just be. Men: grow, find a great, but boring job, marry, have 1 kid, get promoted, have another kid, repeat. Women: just do whatever the man says. I liked Kate in this movie because I truly believed her anguish, the lost feeling she had, the 'no-escape' clause she thought there was. If anyone gets nominated, it should be her. Everyone else, including Leo, might have just walked off the 'Mad Men' extras back lot. Overall, I liked the film and the study of the two seemingly (but really not) cardboard cuts of the neighborhood (or times); however it seemed to stretch a 20-page-novelette into 2 hours of film. And boy, did it really make me want to have a cigarette, and not because of any steamy scenes.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A Waste of Talent,10/3/2019,Nick J,23-二月-09,"Perhaps 3 out of 10 is a little bit generous for this monstrous waste of time, but I feel I had to at least give the actors some credit, because they made the best out of an insufferably dull and pointless story. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this film. I went to see it and walked out after an hour. I want that time back! The premise of the film as a suburban couple who are unhappy with their lives. I guess the idea is that people might relate to it. It's the sort of film where people can see a bit of themselves in the characters. Maybe that's why it is so popular.

But if that's the case, why not just look in the mirror?

Revolutionary Road,Wow...that's all I can say,10/10/2019,pinknole05,24-十二月-08,"Fantastic Picture! Several times throughout it I just could not believe the performances from Kate and Leo. Do not look at this movie merely as negative and depressing. To dismiss it as such would be to oversimplify to the Nth degree. What it is a brilliant work of art sculpted to perfection by everyone involved and I can not wait to watch it again. The raw emotions displayed in this movie just grip you from start to finish and you are engulfed by these people and their lives. When I heard about another pairing of Winslet and DiCaprio, I was wary to say the least. While I am a fan of both actors, I had grown up with the I Love Leo generation and did not think I could see past Titanic. Some might say that this is just Jack and Rose further down the line, but I respectfully disagree. You can tell that both of them have come so far in their careers and though I felt a little funny watching them together again, it quickly faded (even though Kathy Bates was in it too which I thought was funny). Please watch this movie with an open mind and heart and you will not be disappointed!

Revolutionary Road,Jerry Springer for the Intelligentsia,10/1/2019,GrumpsterFire,19-九月-18,"There are enough other reviews that tell you what the movie is about. This is mostly a warning.

I believe watching this stuff is more damaging to your psyche than watching porn - or Jerry Springer. The theme of this movie could be stated as, ""Life sucks and then you die."" It's two hours of people at their worst - fighting, yelling and fornicating with virtual strangers. The best you take away from this mess is that, ""Hey, at least I'm better than *them*.""

But as you can tell from the majority of the reviews and ratings, it's very popular. But then, so is Jerry Springer.

Revolutionary Road,An awful couple shout at each other over and over again,10/1/2019,DavidYZ,22-四月-17,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. None of the characters are likable. A boring man and a horrible woman don't achieve their pipe dreams, so they have loads of blazing rows. This unlikeable couple shout at each other at the top of their voices over and over and over again.

There was so much hype and praise heaped on this film and The Reader in 2008 - yet both films are dreadful. They're a waste of Kate Winslet's acting talent - she's great in Heavenly Creatures.

Revolutionary Road,Disturbing,10/5/2019,ryancm,2-六月-09,"I liked REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, not love it. Much to dark with not much character development. Why was this couple the way they were? The saving grace of the film is the terrific acting by all....KATE WINSLET could have won the award for this and not THE READER. SPOILER ALERT: Ironic that she should die in both films. Suicide in one and an apparent suicide in the other. Strange. A couple of minor nit-pics. Through the film, the kids were only seen briefly a couple of times. Where were they during all the home scenes? Once they we are told they are a birthday party, but what about all the other scenes. The one big fight scene at the end, where were the kids? It was late at early evening that stretched to the late evening? No kids? Also, didn't this young couple have any parents or siblings or aunts or uncles. No mention is made of family. Didn't they ever visit? They were not even talked about. Very strange indeed and NOT realistic.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Another fantastic and amazing movie of DiCaprio and Winslet.,10/8/2019,MrsRachel,15-二月-09,"Revolutionary Road, it's an amazing movie, because of some facts: First we need to analyze the title ('Revolutionary Road'), I think there's no doubt that the title is perfect for the movie, because Frank and April's life is like a revolution, the ideas they've got aren't from 1950's people: dreaming about a different life, April wants to work and Frank doesn't, the abortion...things that aren't in line with the time.It's good to show that people had dreams and wanted to get them in these times.So it's positive. Next one of the best things in the movie is the different personalities of the characters, how they try to coexist with each other. Like April and Frank's personalities, they are opposites, this is why their lives end badly (remember April's death) and they cannot be happy (remember the way they treat their children), so they try to live in another reality, in a fictitious reality, which is not the real life, and they try to get their own dreams doing everything they can (like the abortion, to travel to Paris) but they can't, then is just all wrong, then the differences between them and the discussions appear. To combine and focus these types of personalities is a very difficult job, so I want to congratulate Sam Mendes who's an excellent director.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Very depressing,10/8/2019,dedoc1,8-二月-09,"The most depressing movie I've ever seen. Represents a fusion of existentialism and Buddhism i.e. each of us is essentially alone, life is pain and suffering and life is meaningless and without purpose. Watching this film should be a requirement for anyone about to marry. I've also been told this movie will greatly benefit anyone going through the break-up of a relationship. No matter how much you are hurting, this movie will remind you that there's always someone in more pain than you are (hence makes you feel a little better) and that being single is a blessing - marriage is a curse which produces and maintains suffering.

This movie makes Kate Winslet's other movie ""The Reader"" seem like a light-hearted comedy in comparison. Thank goodness that everyone eventually dies as it appears to be the only way not to miserable.

Having said that, the acting is incredible and the movie portrays misery better than most.",pos
Revolutionary Road,do not retire yourself to the ordinary,10/8/2019,jtdavisson,3-二月-09,"EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! It is a strong reminder or wake up call! A reminder to those few people who are in relationships that they work hard to keep fresh and exciting and ALIVE to KEEP DOING IT! A WAKE UP CALL to the rest of us who resign ourselves to the monotony of suburban family living once we have children- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY!!! CHILLING at times!!! DEPRESSING at times!! HUMOROUS at times!!!! Exhilarating at times!!! It runs you through the gamut of emotions!!! Don't MISS THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE!!!!

Revolutionary Road,"Sorry, but this one misses, big time!",10/2/2019,Aldrone71,2-二月-09,"Okay, maybe the novel wasn't that great, but this one has basic, fundamental screenplay flaws. Performances were decent, but the setups just didn't exist. I know what it was ""about,"" but what was the specific theme? Where was it stated? What about her play in the beginning, we don't hear any more about her desire to act? Where did she get this disdain for life from? Where were the freaking kids the whole time? Where were the neighbors, other humans, etc...? I'm sorry to say that it felt like an attempt to keep the stars in the mix as far as awards go (which they did great) but so much of it was hard to believe. At less than 30 DiCaprio is already unhappy enough to have a quickie affair, but then all of a sudden HE is the model father?? things just didn't match up...

Revolutionary Road,This could be the sequence of Titanic?,10/8/2019,pizza_sky,22-一月-09,"Imagine if Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet character has survived ""Titanic"" and really made it alive to the newfoundland, America. Their loving passionate never ending love in their 20's might just end up like this in their 30's, a angry couple living in suburban city, can't fell satisfied with their ""boring hopeless empty"" life. Oh, and the car love scene, also have one in ""Titanic"" but with a whole different atmosphere which increase the irony.

Di Caprio play a husband who have a boring yet well paid salesman job which he hate. Winslet play a housewife and a failed actress wannabe. Is this a trend lately in Hollywood? Same as ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" that life in US is a ""hopeless emptiness"" and people should move to the romantic Europe, Paris in this case to finally can ""live life"". And if you are forced to stay their big house, a small wood to have an afternoon walk, then what you can do is do a little extra to ""spice thing up"".

And hey, the director, Sam Mendes, who's work ""American Beauty"" is totally amazing, is Kate Winslet husband. And Winslet won another best actress from Golden Globe from this movie. Oh boy, Di Caprio must hate her a lot now, cause he miss winning any award both in the ""Titanic"" and this. But the truth is Winslet is amazing, her acting, expression and the sadness, agony in her eye really make us understand her character perfectly. And Di Caprio look like a boy not yet grown up, his acting is dull sometimes, and great in some scene. He's not that consistent, and I can't figure out in the dinner with boss scene, is his expression is mocking someone in his head, or thinking things over? In the 1950 Connecticut, apparently speaking out the truth although the horrible truth might distress the society, chasing dreams, running away from responsibility is consider insane, ands should be put in the asylum, for God shake. The property agent family with their ""crazy"" Math PHD son, and their next door couple is a nice touch, without them the movie won't be complete.

Adapted from a book by Richard Yates, and this is a story that will keep you pondering after the end. And wondering what is right or wrong? Maybe nothing is right or wrong, it's just the choices we made in life.",pos
Revolutionary Road,missed the point,10/3/2019,harryandsally,19-一月-09,"This movie has missed the point. It has no faith in humanity or love. I wonder how Mendes feels about his marriage to Kate?? April Wheeler is a shallow character. Revolutionary Road has no more depth than a too-long play. The story has no meat and is not consistent. The only redeeming factor is Leonardo DiCaprio's outstanding performance--keep at it Leo--you are above and beyond the rest. The scene at the end with Leo and his kids really breaks your heart. At then end the plot ties back to the beginning with Kathy Bates' character talking about the new couple who has moved in to the Revolutionary Road house. But there is more to it than that, than just a replacement couple. So much could have been done with this story--more insight into the neighborhood, the house, the people. The lack of character development was a real problem with understanding and caring about April and Frank. There is more to life than this film shows.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Worse than one star,10/1/2019,darrelldklein,10-八月-11,"Picked it up from the library, for free, and was still disappointed. Horribly uneven writing, horribly uneven acting. When both are good, the suspension of disbelief is in effect and it is about a five star movie. When either is down, it is like watching takes that should have been cut. When both are down it is embarrassing. Good stars attract, but the end product is simply not worth your time. My best guess is that the stars are simply too nice to relate to the characters and so cannot pull off believable performances. My wife and I were rooting for it to end. Do yourself a favor, go to the library and pick up and watch Madmen instead!

Revolutionary Road,A reluctant Stepford wife,10/7/2019,Michael Fargo,2-一月-09,"There is something missing in Sam Mendes' adaptation of the Yates' novel, ""Revolutionary Road."" I fault specifically the screenplay which is heavy on explanatory dialog. The characters are trying to explain to one another what's wrong, while the audience is way ahead. We see the problem, and then a secondary character comes in later and spells it out even more clearly..

The over enunciation of every word by both the leads is also peculiar. This sounds like a stage play that the two actors have over-rehearsed. And we're given all the ""high points"" of their arguments with little understanding of why they are drawn to one another or why one or the other just doesn't leave.

If we're supposed to condemn the ""system"" that has put them on Revolutionary Road, that has been left out. Their personal problems seem much deeper than whatever rat race a capitalistic society has trapped them in. I felt like any place they were headed, they'd be just as unhappy. Their lack of fulfillment doesn't much matter since we don't see that there's much potential anywhere. Particularly in Mr. DiCaprio's character who is a liar, hates and uses just about everyone around him, and then bullies his wife into being whatever he'd like. It's a particularly unpleasant performance by a usually gifted and affecting actor.

Ms. Winslet comes off somewhat more sympathetic, but the constant baiting of her husband in most of the fighting grows tiresome. My favorite moment (and it's a nicely held one by the director) occurs at a roadhouse when Ms. Winslet cuts lose on the dance floor and becomes reckless and seductive. It's a terrific moment for the actress and for the audience.

I won't go into the plot since it would spoil what little there is, but the subject matter hinges on a lighting rod in today's political climate, and it's treated without much sensitivity.

Even the composer, Thomas Newman, who did so much for Mr. Mendes in ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" (two of my favorite films) seems repetitious and glib. Kathy Bates, however, really perks things up in her scenes showing even playing a one dimensional character can still be both artful and entertaining.",neg
Revolutionary Road,An Acting Masterpiece,10/10/2019,screenwriter-14,31-十二月-08,"I have waited for weeks for this film to open in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, and finally today I saw the film. Dicaprio and Winslet take REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and from the first scenes I think I am back with WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? with Martha and George bickering and arguing with biting dialog. Then REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, because of its time frame, reminds me of the fabulous MADMEN, with that intensity and drama of its leading characters, until I look into the eyes of April, Winslet, and realize that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a story and journey of two characters with their own enemies to face. Every frame of the film and the scenes between Kate and Leo remind me of what that it must have been like in the 1950's, attempting to live that perfect American life, but in the end, you realize that the ""Donna Reed perfect wife and mother"" American character, is a falsehood, and that April is only hoping to find something better. The supporting cast of Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour is superb with characters that only add to the history which is building between the Wheelers.

Sam Mendes does give us hints of American BEAUTY, but in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, he directs a story of brilliant drama and intensity. With the final scene, you can understand how April must have felt in a suburban world of perfection, and lies.",pos
Revolutionary Road,The Best Family Film of 2008!!!,10/9/2019,jordathan,31-十二月-08,"wow, this movie was great!!! this movie about a young, idealistic couple living in a 50s suburban community is sure to grab hold of you! Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing (as always) playing the husband, Frank Wheeler, a man who is disgruntled with his job, but trudges on to provide for his family. sure, he's not perfect and makes mistakes along the way, but who doesn't? i truly felt for this guy as he reaches out to connect with his wife at their hardest moments.

And Kate Winslet, oh, Kate Winslet. she radiates in this movie as April Wheeler, the young wife who wants her husband to be happy while coping with her own personal issues. like her husband, she is also not perfect, but they enjoy great chemistry together on the screen! her dialog delivery is perfect, and it is hard to tear your eyes from hers, as a thousand different emotions fly through them at any given time.

Michael Shannon is also worthy of noting, playing John, a poor, disturbed man who visits the Wheelers with his realtor mother (played wonderfully by Kathy Bates), as he copes with his mental breakdown that has landed him in an asylum. his scenes are at once amusing and heartbreaking.

alright, to be serious now. Sam Mendes has yet to make a bad movie, and this one is no exception. dark? yes. depressing? yes. Revolutionary Road is paved with harsh truths and difficult moments, but it is a beautiful film. Thomas Newman's score may be the best of the year, and Kate Winslet delivers what may be the best female performance of the year. go see it with an open mind, and let it haunt you afterwards.",pos
Revolutionary Road,This ain't no titanic folks,10/7/2019,Jax0524,26-十二月-08,"After finally seeing revolutionary road I have to say I was immediately blown away, Leo and Kate definitely delivered the goods I was mostly surprised at Leo's performance to be quite honest especially with him playing the role of a father and husband for the first time. He was phenomenal he brought out emotions that I've never seen him do before especially towards the end and his final confrontation with April, calling her a ""cold heartless shell of a woman"" and at the same time you can tell that he is absolutely hurt and crushed as he starts to break down in tears, it was both frightening and heart wrenching.

Kate Winslet was absolutely fantastic, I found myself in the end really sympathizing with April throughout the film a little bit more so than frank. April is a woman who wants something different out of life and refuses to give into conformity and is willing to escape it at any cost. She comes up with the impulsive decision to move to Paris and convinces frank that they should go, Frank agrees but due to unforeseen circumstances(April getting pregnant)Frank changes his mind and decides to take the raise that is given to him at his job at Knox. Of course April is extremely disappointed to the point of which (I think) she becomes a little bit of a sociopath. It becomes even more apparent when Frank openly tells her the truth about his affair with his secretary and she simply responds ""why did you? no, I don't mean why did you have the girl I mean why did you tell me about it?, is that supposed to make me jealous, or back into bed with you?"" There are times in this movie when you just want to call April a b***h but at the same time you feel sorry for her. the same can also be said for frank, he's sleeping with his secretary and yet you understand that he only wants to do whats right by his family and make his wife happy.

Michael Shannon who I think represents the truth of this film was excellent as well he plays the role of Mrs. Givings ill son who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. His character as ""crazy"" as he might seem to be he is the only character that bluntly puts the truth out for everyone to hear even if they don't want to hear it, especially when it came to his confrontation with frank as he tells him he may have knocked up his wife on purpose as an excuse not to go to Paris.

There are a few questions that did pop in my head afterward like, "" did frank really want to go to Paris?, did he purposely get his wife pregnant to avoid moving to Paris?, would the wheelers truly had been happy in Paris?"". My only complaint about the movie is the ending, it could've been much better, it also bothered me that Frank and April's children rarely were present in the film.

Overall I give the film a 9/10 and I recommend this to anyone",pos
Revolutionary Road,Incredibly depressing film about disillusionment and betrayal,10/4/2019,robert-temple-1,11-五月-10,"Sam Mendes, who in 2002 made the rather depressing and darkly-lit ROAD TO PERDITION, has now made a really deeply depressing film about people screaming and shouting at each other. Leonardo DiCaprio is so good at all of this vicious behaviour that one hopes it really is acting. The only characters in the entire film who are in any way admirable are the long-suffering wife of DiCaprio, played nobly by Kate Winslet (who is not afraid to do without makeup and look increasingly haggard), and a character who is temporarily on release from an insane asylum (excellently portrayed by Michael Shannon), so that it is no accident of the script that the only truths spoken in this film are those declaimed by a madman. This film is set in the leafy Connecticut suburbs near Long Island Sound (a beach of which we actually see in one scene), where DiCaprio and Winslet are 'the Wheelers', an attractive young couple whom everyone admires. Winslet is admirable, but her oafish and totally vacuous husband is not. For years she does not see this, which makes her very dim indeed! Perhaps I should point out that the title of this film does not refer in any way to any revolution, and this is not a film about Lenin or Castro. Revolutionary Road is merely the ironical name of the deeply boring and non-revolutionary suburban street in which the Wheelers live. Kathy Bates is magnificent in her supporting role as a neighbour, but then when was Kathy Bates not magnificent? There is one sensationally brilliant scene in the film where the disillusioned Winslet sits quietly smoking her cigarette while chaos reigns around her, with other people screaming and shouting like the maniacs they all are, a true eye-of-the-storm moment, carried out impeccably by the imperturbable Winslet and, let's face it, brilliantly directed by Mendes. I hate to say that because I don't like the film, but one must be fair. As so often in reviews of violent films, when I ask 'why did they make this?', I have to pose the question as to why Mendes wasted his time on this subject. OK, so he gets credit for no one getting murdered, and he did not have to wipe blood and gore off his lens. Also, there are no exploding cars, no chases, and the only violence is psychological, though that is as intense as it gets. But there are pointless and seedy sex scenes. The Germans have two words which mean 'to eat'. They are 'essen', which applies to humans, and 'fressen', which describes the eating habits of animals. I would describe the copulating habits of animals as imitated by humans by a new word, also adding an 'r', and call it 'serx'. In this film the supposedly devoted wife Winslet has 'serx' in the car with a neighbour. This scene is either inserted to show her state of despair or just because Mendes likes serx scenes. (There is an earlier serx scene between Winslet and her oaf husband which takes place against a wall of the kitchen, where fortunately no pots or pans were hanging, but although nobody banged against any of those, another type of banging did occur.) I think we might also invent a new verb for having sex, by inserting an 'r' into the one which everyone shouts (as in this film) but which, due to the hypocrisy of human society, no one is permitted to write down, and certainly not in a review like this, which might be read by an underage person of, say, 45, and cause offence. So there is serx and there is oafishness and there is shouting and screaming, and that's about it, really. Certainly something to cheer us all up! Thanks, Sam! What's next? DIARY OF A MADMAN?",neg
Revolutionary Road,Not all that revolutionary in 2009,10/5/2019,Joe X.,21-一月-10,"When this novel came out in 1961, with JFK in office and America at the zenith of empire, perhaps this story about the dark rumblings beneath the veneer of suburban normalcy was bold and original. But now? Almost 50 years later? It's been done to death, don't you think?

We get it, Mendes. The suburbs suck, and the American Dream isn't all it's cracked up to be. You already covered that territory once-- more deftly. Add to that: the 50s were a conformist prison. Congratulations, you've hit the cliché trifecta.

The timing on this one is especially bad given our current economic woes. The family lives in a beautiful neighborhood. Husband has a secure, not-too-difficult job and is about to be promoted. Children are healthy and happy. Looks pretty good from the edge of the abyss here in 2010. What's the problem?

The wife never became an artist!--not that she showed any evidence of possessing a speck of talent. Her neighbors are boring!--although they seem to be perfectly nice folks. Their trip to Paris where they were somehow to achieve self-actualization was scrubbed! Her husband turned out to be a rather ordinary fellow and not Cary Grant! Boo freaking hoo!

Take some of hubby's raise, hire a nanny, and then perfect your ""art."" Hell, Grace Metalious wrote Peyton Place under the same set of constraints without the raise and the nanny (during the exact same time period). No, not with this precious broad. It's Paris or nothing for her.

Is this movie trying to say that the wife's inability to grow up --i.e., deal with the responsibilities of life and diminished expectations-- was her tragic flaw? Or is it proposing that ""society"" and ""the times"" caused a non-conformist to destroy herself? It's hard to say, but given the emphasis on setting and period details, it seems to be the latter. Through the telescope of 50 years, it just looks naive and childish. A better theme would be: how do we find dignity and meaning in life once we realize we're not that ""special?"" But that's a little deeper than this shallow examination cared to delve. Much easier to blame the ""phoniness"" of ""society.""

The crazy son of the real estate agent was a clumsy contrivance to catalyze the conflict and hammer the audience over the head with the movie's theme.

The acting was good, given the material. The sets and cinematography were top-notch. It's a great movie to look at with the sound off. Beautiful really, which pushes the rating into respectable territory. Points, too, for at least addressing the most common of adult themes in a straightforward, un-ironic fashion. But in the end, it's rather ""fake-deep"" and superfluous with an unsatisfying ending.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"Gloom, doom and no redemption",10/4/2019,vilnii,18-七月-09,"This movie was probably intended to make a statement, but leaves the viewer with a rather sour after taste.

I did not gain anything from watching, It is not certain what new insights about life the audience is expected to draw at the end, for me however it was a concentrated dose of melancholy down my gullet period.

Dicaprio and Winslet shine in their craft, but are overwhelmed by the irretrievably gloomy script...

Sam Mendes knows best why he made a slow paced, grinding excursion like this. People typically do not go to movies to get reminded how miserable things can get. I suggest folks look elsewhere for entertainment.

Revolutionary Road,A haunting spectre of the American dream...,10/9/2019,galileo3,3-二月-09,"Revolutionary Road (2008)

Top 5 - 2008

Sam Mendes revisits American suburbia after his Oscar laden masterpiece 'American Beauty' which beautifully examined the painful imperfections of suburban life of a middle aged couple in the late 1990s. This time Mendes takes us almost half a century back in 1950s America to examine the life of April and Frank Wheeler who move to a beautiful suburb away from the buzzing city. This is Revolutionary Road, an adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel of the same name.

With elegant camera-work by Mendes, powerful acting from Di Caprio and Winslet (and a host of other solid performances), sharp editing and cinematography, we get a haunting look at the standard premise of the post WWII American Dream. Except this time the dream goes all wrong.

April and Frank Wheeler have a very nice house in a comfortable suburb in middle class America. Frank has a stable income, April is a stay at home mother to their two children. All good? No. The film explores how the life of this couple is empty inside, with no hope - it is an 'elegantly devastating' motion picture as one reviewer put it, Mendes really masters the art of beautiful film-making.

Th story involves a number of character that expand the films dimensions and evolve with the storyline. This is an excellent film and in my opinion one of the top 5 of the year and should have been nominated for Best Picture and Director at this year's Oscars.

Revolutionary Road,Trudging down Revolutionary Road,10/4/2019,gyges03,29-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road can hardly be called a film in any serious sense of the word. It seems more like a series of screen tests, some more successful than others. Both Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet emote vigorously until they appear to get severe hemorrhoids (fatal in the case of the Winslet character). Sometimes the only interest in this film is the exquisite 50s design. I think Sam Mendes is basically a theater director and seems to have taken no interest in the cinematography -the lighting is wildly inconsistent, sometimes sensitive and moody, other times like a mediocre British studio film. On the positive side and unlike the stultifying Benjamin Button movie it was only 2 hours long.

Revolutionary Road,Good Adaptation of Richard Yates's Classic Novel,10/8/2019,J_Trex,28-一月-09,"When watching the trailers for this movie, I wondered why anyone would want to subject themselves to two hours of Leo & Kate yelling at each other. It seemed like the ultimate downer of a film, an uninterrupted stretch of ""The Bickersons"" on the silver screen. Why would an acclaimed Film Director like Sam Mendes and Hollywood luminaries Kate Winslett & Leonardo DiCaprio get behind this project?

""Revolutionary Road"" by Richard Yates is one of the great American novels of the 20th century. Published in 1961, it was hailed critically but it didn't do well commercially. It was a bit too grim in its outlook for the time. This is the first time it's been adapted to film. While the movie is faithful to the book, the novel is much more than just another story of suburban malaise. The movie doesn't go beneath the surface of the characters as the novel does. From watching the movie, we really don't know much about Frank & April Wheeler, other than that they are unhappy with their lives. The book goes into much greater depth. This is the film's major flaw. Like ""The Great Gatsby"", to which it's often compared, the plot and its characters are secondary to the lyricism of the prose. It's very hard to capture this type of literary masterpiece to the big screen. Case in point: Coppola's ""The Great Gatsby"" was a critical failure, despite a massive film budget, big name movie star talent, not to mention Coppola himself directing.

That being said, I thought DiCaprio was great as Frank Wheeler. He really nailed the role perfectly. While Kate good as April, she tended to overact a bit too much. I thought her crying scene toward the dramatic ending was a bit artificial (after she made breakfast for Frank and he left for work) and could have been more genuine. I'm not sure why Mendes didn't do a re-take. It must be tough directing your wife (Mendes is married to Winslett).

All in all, an excellent movie and by all means go see it. My advice would also be to read the book before seeing it. That's not to say one needs to read the book to appreciate the film, but it does help gain a better understanding of the characters and the story.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Art imitates life...I think I'm gonna be sick...,10/10/2019,dinoman22-1,23-一月-09,"The setting indeed takes place in the 50's but this story relates to me in a modern setting.I Agreed, much of this movie is hard to watch, it encompasses the ugly side of human spirit, and emotions that just wrench your heart. I did not realize the Director was Sam Mendes of American Beauty, another timeless classic. His ability to exploit the dark under belly of people is present throughout . At the time of viewing I kept asking myself why is this feel so emotionally charged in a sadistic way?. (It was clearer in hindsight.) The story commanded your attention. I could not look away. I was obligated and compelled to watch the story unfold. The movie is superbly presented,and the acting is top-notched. The feelings of love and hate and disgust I had for Kate and Leo. I don't think this was their best work but they make a fabulous duo,I never felt this movie was trying to hard to be real. This movie reminds me of a past relationship I had. A very real fiasco with two children ,mental illness, abuse, sad times, happy times vs bad times, and the bad times mainly won. The movie is so dark and emotion so raw and in your face. My stomach turns just watching this film. During the film I felt I was stuck back in this painful relationship. I was a bit relieved when the movie finally ended and I could walk away. This movie left me emotionally spent. The supporting cast are the diamonds in the rough,especially Michael Shannon ,who in my opinion stole the show.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"""You were just some boy that made me laugh at a party once.""",10/8/2019,outpix,19-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road (RR) opens as a dreary 'American Dream' landscape that we are not only a part of, but forced to share. RR is intent on making us feel....that is, to which we are undoubtedly numb. Director Sam Mendes (of American Beauty fame) does not make the case that happiness is an illusion but the implication is obvious. The story takes a welcome turn when an antagonist, a former psychiatric patient played by Michael Shannon, ironically reminds the Wheelers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) that it's not enough to satiate life like an empty stomach; It has to be throttled and shuck like a tree until its fruits are given.

DiCaprio's character is afraid to risk the unknown while Winslet's sees no alternatives in 1950's social Connecticut. DiCaprio is compelling and Winslet is magnificent. RR is like listening to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album, you love it but you don't want to go back there too often.",pos
Revolutionary Road,happiness is a choice,10/7/2019,mahalkosimaf,13-一月-09,"Director Sam Mendes, revisits the tedium of adult life in a way reminiscent of his other movie ""American Beauty.""

Set in the 1950's suburbia, Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) meet at a bar and instantly hit it off, they marry and acquire a modest house along revolutionary road. They seem to be a happy couple to the outside world but the lack of fulfillment from the ennui of adult life and their shattered personal dreams and aspirations slowly push their marriage into destruction. Forced to stick with a job he loathes and having difficulty comforting his wife after an unsuccessful stint as a stage actress, Frank starts an extra-marital affair with a co-worker. Kate for her part, starts to become irritable just looking after the house and their 2 children, and not being able to pursue her acting.

In an effort to get out of the stifling conformity of their austere married life, April asks Frank to leave everything behind and start a life in Paris (the only place worth living in, according to Frank) and finally ""LIVE"" the way they dreamed of before, not a care in the world, just enjoying a bit of their their individuality, their togetherness and their 2 children.

Everything is going according to plan and their trip is only a few weeks away, until an unexpected 3rd pregnancy stalls them, and to mess things further, Frank is now being offered a job promotion and a raise, with the 3rd baby on the way, the offer is a hundred times more attractive.

Frank thinks it's better to stay, Kate is devastated..

and down they go to the demise of their marriage...

***

This movie is not only tragic, it's almost depressing, the movie's no-holds-barred way of delivering its punches is so brutally honest it's scary. It's like a violent and repugnant defilement of something you have faith in-- married life.

Yet, it rings true, a conservative and by-the-mold married life is what most couples dream of. To marry, buy a house, have kids and have a job that pays well-- nevermind if the work sucks, so long as it supports the family it's OK. This has been ingrained far too long in society and an open challenge to stray from what is usual and common will be bereft of success, and will be met with skepticism---- at least that is what the movie is saying..

This movie therefore is too frank, and by definition almost always unappealing.. but there is wisdom in it, the wisdom that there is always an OPTION, that things can be done according to one's own standards and not society's.

It is hard, it could even be ""fatal"", but the most salient point of this movie is that--

""TRUE HAPPINESS"" is always just one choice away,,..

***

I wouldn't really recommend this movie, because it's so devastating, but the leads are superb. DiCaprio's emotionally charged portrayal should have won him a golden globe, I can only assume that Mickey Rourke was UNBELIEVABLE in The Wrestler for him to get the golden globe instead of DiCaprio, and kudos to Winslet for winning 2 golden globes, one for her acting in this movie.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Mid-century marriage meltdown,10/8/2019,Chris Knipp,11-一月-09,"The talented English stage director Sam Mendes has made another movie that focuses, like his earlier 'American Beauty,' on Stateside suburban discontent. This time his source is Richard Yates' acclaimed 1961 novel of the same name, whose action takes place in 1955. The movie reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (now Mendes' wife) for the first time since 'Titanic,' which turned both of them into big stars. All of which makes this a movie well worth seeing, and DiCaprio and Winslet, seasoned and proved now, give intense, balls-out performances, as do several in the supporting cast, especially the edgy character actor Michael Shannon. It doesn't all quite work as a movie. Despite performances that are a knockout, the movie feels perfect, yet empty. But the novel is a stunner and even delivered in this skeletal, overly theatrical form leaves you with plenty to think about.

'Revolutionary Road' is a passionate indictment of the roles of men and women in mid-century America and the conformism and lack of imagination imposed by the prevailing institutions. Familiar topics perhaps, but Yates' treatment of them is a seminal one. This will show you where Women's Lib came from. A memorable if artificial shot of an army of men marching down into Grand Central to work in Manhattan, all of them in hats, underlines the prevalent sense that middle class white men were as imprisoned as their spouses in their gray flannel suits, their air-conditioned nightmare, their other-directed conformity from which the only escapes were the liquid lunch of tee many martoonies, the quick rolls in the hay with sad little secretaries. The movie is good at capturing the outward shell; not so successful at penetrating within. The Fifties are dangerous ground for younger filmmakers, who have trouble seeing beyond the shiny cars and jaunty jazz.

Another, perhaps more insidious, defense was irony and detachment. Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) seeks refuge there, while dabbling in martinis and secretaries too. He pretends to disdain his copy-writing job with a business machine company. For this same company his father worked for decades, unnoticed by executives, as a New Jersey sales representative. Frank, despite his disdain, which implies he envisions still better for himself, is on the way to a materially better life than his Willy Loman father. At thirty he drives a Buick, has this decent job, and lives with his pretty blond wife and their two young kids in a pretty house in Connecticut with lots of lawn. Their neighbor, Mrs. Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), the real estate agent who sold them the house, thinks them a lovely couple. When April (Winslet) was dating Frank, she thought him the most interesting, different, adventurous man she'd ever met. They think of themselves as detached from their surroundings: intelligent, creative. He has spoken of living in Paris. She fancies herself as an actress.

But nothing works, because April and Frank are only pretending to be better than their surroundings and are both quite ordinary. The couple comes on scene with a major row after April has starred in an amateur play production that is a flop. In the novel, the performance of the play, and April's evident pain as it disintegrates around her, are described in excruciating detail, but the movie skips all that and cuts to the drive home. What is surprising is how mean and accusatory Frank is. He originally thought of nice and comforting things to say to April about the play, but that's all in the book, not the movie.

April cooks up the plan of moving to Paris. They will sell the house and the car. She has heard secretaries for international organizations get high salaries in Paris. She'll work to support them (presumably with a nanny for the kids) while Frank discovers himself. Frank very reluctantly gives in, and they go ahead with plans to move. April reassures the children they'll survive with fewer toys and new friends. The Givings bring their son John (Shannon), who's been in a mental institution, and while the Paris idea shocks his parents, he congratulates Frank and April on their decision to escape from the boredom of middle-class America. Then something happens, and it all falls apart. For one thing, a memo Frank writes as a lark gets him recognition from the top management and the offer of a promotion that's too exciting to resist. The verbal fights between April and Frank, fueled by endless drinks and cigarettes, get more and more bitter, until finally there is silence, in a chilling nice breakfast when April sees Frank off to work before tragedy strikes.

Frank is not an attractive person. He has neither talent nor character, and takes unconvincing refuge in being a smart-ass. He's a rotter, condescending toward his wife, a liar, a man too full of himself to possess self-awareness. DiCaprio embraces and embodies all that. The role of April is harder because she's repressed, hiding. Her earlier enthusiasm for Frank as the most interesting person she's met becomes pathetic when it's revealed to have been so mistaken. Ultimately the movie has trouble working as a movie because both its main characters are hollow shells. It would take a lot of prose (which is found in Yates' novel) to fill in substance around these shells.

The screenplay captures the main movements of the novel. But the exquisite cinematic detail, the precisely correct-to-period drapes, rugs, couches, suits, hats, and so forth, down to the overly-interesting artworks on the Wheeler walls, distract from the intense interactions. Must quite so many cigarettes be lit, cocktail glasses of gin quaffed? The movie's devastating scenes from a marriage would work better as a play with simple sets, without sprinklers and lawns and Buicks and Grand Central. Sam Mendes, as a stage director, may have miscalculated in seeing the screenplay as a series of intense scenes of dialogue and not perceiving how the movie-work surrounding these scenes of dialogue would undermine them.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Must see, this could change your life!",10/10/2019,donorth,11-一月-09,"This is a difficult movie to watch because I think that the many messages will resonate with any and everyone. It's important to live our lives for ourselves, not for our parents, not for our spouses and not to let life pass us by. Once we stop we stop dreaming, we stop living. I know that sounds extreme, but this movie has made me reflect on all of the time I've wasted, who I've lived my life for and whether I've left things too long to change. It's far too easy to accept our lot in life and just run out the string in our mediocre and less than satisfying existence until we die. The Wheeler family, April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) are a couple that has moved to an ""idyllic"" small town to live out the ""dream"" but in reality, no one seems to be able to be true to themselves or to communicate and the dream is shown for what it really is, a nightmare.",neg
Revolutionary Road,It makes me love and hate so much at the same time,10/8/2019,haliem_bali,10-一月-09,"This is what I felt when I completely watched this movie. I hate the characters in this movie, because it's so real and remind me the same things that I and my partner did in the past, just like Frank and April did. You will feel embarrass because we thought we could make revolutionary road in our relationship but we can't, just like in this movie. It's like a ceremony of tragedy in our life, so empty, painful, and regretful.

The movie is especially for the people who have already made a long relationship with someone who they loved. The movie teaches us about how weak and vulnerable the relation is and you still cannot solve it until something bad happen and you just cry. I was definitely angry after I watched this movie.

On the other hand, we should give a deep appreciation to this movie. The characters are so real, like we watch our long relationship, so boring, full of angry and misery. This movie uses straight dialog and I salute the mimic of the actors and actress. The plot of the story and the melodrama of this movie are amazing and perfect. Watch it then you can feel how you love and hate at the same time. It is just the only movie.",pos
Revolutionary Road,masterful adaptation,10/9/2019,mukava991,31-十二月-08,"Kate Winslet again proves she can play suburban American housewives. LITTLE CHILDREN would have been enough, but granted, she reaches impressive heights as an intelligent but emotionally insecure young woman with bohemian tendencies who sees herself trapped in a stifling suburbia in this exploration of the dark side of the American dream. Almost as effective is Leonardo DiCaprio as her similarly dissatisfied office worker husband. Supporting player Michael Shannon is electrifying as John Givings, an eerily perceptive mental patient who upsets their fragile sense of equilibrium at a tense point in the drama. Kathy Bates plays Shannon's mother, a real estate agent/neighbor but seems to be retreading the character she played in ABOUT SCHMIDT several years back: friendly, loquacious, somewhat overbearing and very strange.

As he did in the highly overrated American BEAUTY and the flawed but under-appreciated ROAD TO PERDITION, British director Sam Mendes handles American material with style and steadiness. He has a well thought out sense of shot composition; the climactic scene (the details of which I will not divulge) with Winslet standing in front of her picture window is a case in point. Justin Haythe's screenplay persuasively retains the essence of the Richard Yates novel about people who don't know who they are, hook up in what they think or hope is true love and come to hate each other. The actors tear into their roles vigorously. There are many powerful moments and very few dull ones. Winslet and DeCaprio give it all they've got.

Among the layers excised from the novel is the emotional suffering of the Winslet-DiCaprio couple's children. In olden days most movies conveniently sent the children off to play, off to bed, off with a nanny after giving us an idyllic glimpse of them in order to establish the parenthood of the central adult dramatic personae. Few films ever convincingly integrated the messy realities of raising real children into their plots or dramatic situations. The same thing happens here. Just one nugget from the novel illustrating the harm done to the children would have strengthened the overall presentation.

By and large, however, this is a masterful adaptation.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Eh,10/3/2019,michaeltrivedi,2-十月-19,"Leo DiCaprio in a romantic film. You hope it works like Titanic, but there's something missing. It's just a boring movie, mixed with some interesting parts.

It basically tells the story of the trials and tribulations of being married. It's sort of a bore fest. I couldn't finish it. Still, there's something there. I would suggest a watch on a really boring day.

Revolutionary Road,the movie savours like a fresh Merlot!,10/10/2019,kim_singh,6-九月-19,"You cannot help comparing it to ""Titanic"". Very different movies, totally different genres. But the very same leading cast. And besides Leonardo and Kate there is the magnificent and indomitable Kathy Bates. It has been eleven years, both Leonardo and Kate have matured as actors. This film is a very mature film and the drama, the character development is so beautifully choreographed. Today is my second viewing, several years apart. But the movie savours like a fresh Merlot. Cheers to amazing direction and superb acting. The marvelous music and script make this masterpiece gel.

I say fairly because I had a feeling April would die after she said goodbye to Frank, at the climax of the film but, I thought she was going to commit suicide so the ending did take me by surprise to a certain extent.

This may seem a bit ridiculous but I found it a bit annoying when April and Frank's children ""disappeared"". I feel like viewers were left without much context as to where the children were.

This young couple moves to the suburbs and with it a certain style of life is expected. A conflict then arises as to whether to follow the norm or actually break-free and live a life on ones own terms.

Revolutionary Road,"Beautiful, Sad, Realistic",10/10/2019,camnju,30-七月-19,"First off, let me start by saying, the acting and overall performances given by both DiCaprio and Winslet are undoubtedly phenomenal, as to be expected with such veterans as themselves. However the plot and dialogue itself deserve a standing ovation. The story is about Frank and April Wheeler, a suburban couple with two kids who live the stereotypical suburban family life. However neither Frank or April are content with the lives they lead, and they both know this, and it shows displayed through a very toxic relationship shared between the two. Although one day, April goes to Frank chanting of the impossible... LIVING THE LIFE THEY WANT TO, discarding the norms society has set in place for them. This movie is beautifully tragic, and to avoid any spoilers, I'll leave it at that, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It is hard to make something that is so simple yet so realistic and do it in such a way that is as entertaining as this film.

Revolutionary Road,As Meaningful As Plots Get,10/10/2019,bobbydeekhakeh-98441,18-七月-19,"There aren't too many films that have a meaning behind them more powerful than Revolutionary Road.

It was of course a novel by Richard Yates, who deserves all the credit as far as story goes. But this is the movie based on that book.

I call this contemporary fiction. And the meaning of the story is that toxic relationships do not work.

I didn't necessarily love watching the film. It wasn't necessary all that captivating. At times it also wasn't exactly clear what happens. If you're willing to do a bit of searching around the internet for clarification after watching, you cannot leave this experience a changed person. You will now know why toxic relationships are doomed.

I put this film right up there with Mystic River as far as meaning goes.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Incredible acting but...,10/5/2019,ksolfacebook,8-七月-19,"If this film was supposed to convince me that running away from responsibilities to fulfill a desire for what a life might have been is preferable to facing challenges head on like a decent human being, specifically when it comes to unexpected pregnancies, the filmmakers are sorely mistaken. Ironically, the consequences of attempting to live a life you want but should not have are masterfully displayed in the end.

Revolutionary Road,Reality that has my stomach hurting.,10/10/2019,Cilica,3-七月-19,"Raw reality of a couple stuck in the cycle that has become the norm for too many people. You cannot afford to dream because the mortgage is due, the children have needs and you just on with it. The interesting challenge here is listening to the 'insane' friend who speaks the true of the stale, boredom the premeditates everyday life. And he is the insane one.

Incredible acting, worth every minute and why my stomach hurt - I feel the turmoil, I feel the choices to sacrifice happiness and dreams families make to pay for a life that they are formed to want from childhood by society. A happy life put on a pedestal that one can never reach in the 1950's and often today.

Then very ending is priceless at conveying who really lives in their own dreams.",pos

Revolutionary Road,Successful movie reflecting post-war existential crisis,10/7/2019,canperincekster,7-一月-19,"Revolutionary Road is a successful movie in terms of conveying its message with an acceptable level of cinematography and narrative form. The movie, mainly revolves around the post-war people and their existential crisis. However, more specifically, it deals with the woman that is trapped into the domestic space. This crisis is reflected as lacking the ability to realize his dreams for the man (Leonardo di Capri) and lacking the opportunity to realize itself as a free woman and promising actress for the woman character (Kate Winslet). Of course, as the ""backbone"" of the household economy, the man's inability, in turn, impedes the woman from pursuing her own path. Domestic duties and especially the ""child-making"" duty of the woman are seen as the main symbols of the woman's trappedness. Having a house, car and a child is seen as the sufficient causes to be happy and satisfied...

On the other hand, the movie also represents the middle-class families' banality as whole. Although they seemingly have all the ""conditions"" and properties to attain happiness and they are seen as the ideal couple and family by the way, everything eventually becomes meaningless and aimless. At this point, the movie juxtaposes the projected life in Paris and the too ordinary life in the place where they currently live in the US. The name of the road and, thus, the movie attracts attention in this respect: Revolutionary Road. It is very ironical and creates a contrasting effect between the dreams and realities of the family.

The masterful performances of di Caprio and Winslet fit very well to this post-war crisis scene. The plot flows very well and presents these ideas in a tidy form. Most impressively, hints of the suicidal tendencies of the woman (Kate Winslet) from the dance scene on were very well placed into the plot.

As a result, Revolutionary Road, as a typical Hollywood movie, does not contain anything special cinematographically. If so, it could have been a very good and assertive movie both for the popular and intellectual audiences.",pos

It's about young married American couple with two kids who all of a sudden decide to move to Paris for a chance of a fresh start.

Revolutionary Road,Glass Half Empty,10/7/2019,dansview,20-七月-18,"Unless we are terminally ill, prisoners of war or unemployed in the Third World, we usually have at least two ways to look at our situation in life. The couple in this film, who were apparently created by a book author, not a screenwriter or director, chose the ""glass half empty"" way. They had a beautiful home, healthy children, friends, and youth, but they were miserable because they thought life was supposed to be more romantic. I don't think their dream of that way of life is illegitimate or stupid. There are people who live in bohemian cities, toil in the arts and don't have children, and that may be a satisfying way to go. I believe that these people could have made other choices besides marriage, kids, and suburban life. But that's what they chose. Having said that we don't see any depiction of activities in the suburbs beyond the basics. Yet suburban people often do volunteer work, have multiple hobbies, go to church, and get into the city for the arts when they can. All of those things alleviate whatever inherent boredom comes with the territory. All these people do is dwell on their misery. These dark commentaries on suburban life often focus on Godless sorts. People who believe that their own daily existence is the center of the universe often get disappointed when they realize that it's not. But they have nothing to fill the void. It's true what the other reviewers said that we didn't get much in the way of initial character development, but we did get a few basics and we heard more later. I thought the acting was good, but the scenes with the disturbed son of their realtor were too frequent and too heavy handed. They should have had one good scene of dialogue with him and left it at that. He was excruciating to watch. Don't be so sure that the film makers or author are mocking the 50s or suburbia. Through their characters they explain the pointlessness of thinking that some other romantic life is out there. For most of us this is all there is and that's o.k. The 50s or any time are what we make of them. None of the immoral decisions that people make in this film are considered cool. We see the guilt and anguish in those who commit them. There's actually some great dialog including statements about immaturity, the annoying nature of over-talking and over-analyzing, and the fact that the grass is not always greener somewhere else. Seven Stars. It was way too depressing to enjoy and lacked any balance in the form of say at least one couple that was genuinely happy and functional.",pos
Revolutionary Road,My Favorite Kate Winslet Movie.,10/10/2019,cinephile-27690,9-七月-18,"""Titanic"" stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio(and even Kathy Bates) reunite for for this movie, which many people call ""Titanic"" if Jack had lived. However, Jack and Rose are now Frank and April, and they want to live a new life, in Paris to be particular. However, they have affairs which makes the marriage complicated. ' Frank commits adultery, and confesses it to April, and she has no reaction due to an event early in the movie. Frank, in better terms says ""So you don't care who I have sex with?"" After the movie I told Grandma that April took that really well. Grandma said ""I wouldn't take it well!"" I personally like this better than ""Titanic"". The main reason for that is there isn't a subplot like the ""necklace"" in RR. I can't say much else, but you should know I gave this my highest rating and so did Roger Ebert. That should show how good it is!

Revolutionary Road,What Happened to the Revolution?,10/6/2019,daoldiges,31-五月-18,"Revolutionary Road really is a road, and it's where the two main characters, a married Leonardo DeCaprio and Kate Winslet, have purchased their first home from realtor Kathy Bates to raise their two children. It's in CT and Leonardo's character commutes into the city every day to a job he doesn't like and comes homes each night to Kate Winslet who is an unfulfilled actress. They're unhappy with their lives and devise a plan to suddenly move to Paris, thinking that is what they need to feel happy. Things don't go quite as planned though. I liked all of the performances and this film looked good too. Unfortunately the characters were somewhat flat and one dimensional. There is a lot of emotion put forth by the characters but as a viewer it's not really felt, only on display. I think there was a lot og good elements here but for me they don;t really add up to a satisfying experience.

Revolutionary Road,Another sparkle lit by DiCaprio-Winslet,10/10/2019,alma_halliwell,4-五月-18,"Such a realistic portrayal of marriage and relationships in general that it literally hurts to watch. No other couple expect Winslet-DiCaprio would manage to breathe life in these two characters. It is magnificent how slow and how painful life can be when we realise we didn't fulfill something we wanted. I usually pick a side when I watch a movie sometimes consciously sometimes without being aware of it but this time I couldn't blame neither of them. In real life this happens so often, we don't have bad guy- good guy but it just doesn't work due to a variety of intrinsic or outer reasons.

Revolutionary Road,An achingly beautiful drama of the highest class,10/10/2019,chetanchopra012,29-四月-18,"It's been over an hour since I finished watching 'Revolutionary Road' as I begin writing this review. Such is the effect of this film that I can't really stop thinking about it. I am not sure how to describe this one for I feel I will not be able to do justice with it. So I would just say a couple of things. First, it is by far among THE BEST drama movies ever made. Almost all the performances flabbergasting but Katherine Winslet's stands out. She has carried the whole weight of the film on her shoulders and never fails to impress us in any scene she is a part of. The altercations between her and Leonardo are captivating and give us the essences of the life of an ambitious couple and the thick and thin they have to go through. Second is the screenplay and dialogues which are simply superb. You will not want to miss even a single scene. I watched a couple of scenes twice or thrice also. It would be a cardinal sin if you miss this one. I hope I'm clear.

Revolutionary Road,Sad & Hopeless Film...Yet Well done & Great Acting,10/6/2019,mosuna51,25-三月-18,"Winslet & DiCaprio do a fine job expressing the hopeless place that human beings can go when the big Questions of life are not dealt with outside of ones self. And truly, they display this despair, frustration, depression, confusion and hopelessness if any 2 people could in their performances. My husband & I watched this together, having been in unhealthy relationships in our younger lives (now in a wonderful marriage in our late 60's 70's). We both were saddened as we watched the well done development of their characters...the momentary hope...then despair & division. We both looked at each other, knowing that it wasn't so much about traditional marriage in the 50's ""burbs"" being the issue, as it was that they lacked tools in their tool chest. The tragedy was their inability to communicate effectively, love one another in a healthy way, and in our opinion...being happily married so many yrs...to have a spiritual foundation that helps people be close & forgiving. In this respect we felt sad watching because as some have shared-it is a dark & tragic film. Yet, we must say that they did a great job portraying the kind of road couples ""can"" go down in any scenario, not just traditional marriages. The supporting actors as well as the historical settings are very well done. There is a strong political statement in the film that watchers will either agree with or not...& this bugged us both, but - so be it - this is Hollywood. Either way, fine performances.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Too many words, please stop talking now!",10/8/2019,ratcat0,17-二月-18,"This movie is strangely reminicsent of American beauty. You have the odd one person who seems to be at odds with societies norms, the office workaday non-person who is at odds with his wife, and a really very odd almost crazy person in the mix who really makes the most sense. Its a one time viewing sort of movie that works on many levels but doesnt quite seem to hit the mark, Di-Caprio, Winslet and Kathy Bates all do an extraordinary job to make this believable.When DiCaprio's character does all he can to be the doting husband suddenly does an about face in what would have been the 'Out' that his wife had been hoping for everything seems to fall apart. The deep complicated relationship between Kate and Leonard just quickly gets bogged down in a verbose frustrating quagmire of hurt and to top it off an unwanted pregnancy seals the deal. Hence we get too the point when Kate simply says ""stop talking"" A point made clear at the end when the husband of Kathy Bates turns down his hearing aid to deaden the sound of her voice. A sad and bitter end an almost nonredeemable situation. Worth a look.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Beautiful story telling of a failing marriage,10/9/2019,davidbuimd-38604,10-二月-18,"Superb performance by the leads draw the viewers into a not-so-unfamiliar suburban family drama. What makes the film so appealing is that it speaks directly to so many married couples. If we don't see resemblances of our lives in the film, we would see it in our friends' and relatives'.

Through all the fights and drama, we alternatively sympathize with the husband and the wife. The great cast of neighbors enliven the story. The film leads the viewers on an emotional ride as April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) hit a rough patch, reconcile, then descend into further chaos. We are inclined to ""take side"" in the couple conflict, but as the story unfolds, who is responsible for the crumbling relationship and who is the strong one becomes less clear cut.

The film beautifully explores the emotion and characters of a loving couple in crisis when both realized that they had fallen into domesticity and might be missing out on life (or maybe not). It leaves us pondering about the choices we've made and the life we've resigned to.",pos

And the second thing is that you don't get all your plot holes filled but why would they? I think it would be totally boring if every movie answered all your questions. I really enjoyed the acting, it felt so real and pure, this two were made for this art, and the movie it also has the relatable factor, because we all in one point of our lifes get as crazy as this characters, it makes you feel like you are not the only one, and that is spectacular.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Definitely a ROMDRAM! Not what I was expecting though!,10/7/2019,huggibear,25-七月-17,"It was very well acted and it certainly pertained to real lifestyles way back in those days, when times were tough, money was minimal, birth control was limited (I know, I'm a child from a parent that grew up with 12 other children-the baby booming era), but yet choices were plentiful. The settings were phenomenal, exactly to that decade. I even remember the plexi-glass partitions that separated each office cubicle. But the great cinematography had all the old cars in the driveways and in drive-bye's as well. The types of suits and clothes they wore and the aprons all reminded me of that era. This movie has all the emotions covered, most of them. It's worth watching! It's a solid 7 Star movie because even though it was not predictable, it was really good.

Revolutionary Road,The Dark Side of The 'Burbs,10/8/2019,berno-08610,11-五月-17,"The dream is set: wife and husband with two kids will leave everything behind in suburban America and live in Paris where life and personal ambition can be achieved and, more so, felt. It's a dream. It barely rings logically now in the 21st century. So, how can it hold water during the 1950s?

It should first be mentioned that this is no Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet reunion with foggy window love on a sinking ship. Winslet's character, April Wheeler, is the one who brings up Paris, and it's up to her neighbors, her husband's coworkers, and her husband, Frank (DiCaprio), to accept the venture as reality. Whiskey, chain-smoking, and superficial conversation among plastic covered couches go against whimsical idealism with an Eiffel Tower on the side. This is an easy win for the 'burbs.

I loved this movie, but I also think it encompasses its own specific audience. If you enjoyed American Beauty, you are in for an enjoyably intense experience. Sam Mendes directed both, and, as a side note, Kate Winslet is his real-life wife. Mendes seems to be obsessed with what really happens behind the walls of so-called happily married families with white picket fences. It's not that he sees the suburban life as sinister; it's just too ordinary. We root for April and Frank, but we also know that a job promotion, a third child, and skeptic friends will pull them away from the dream.

Watching DiCaprio and Winslet, it is difficult to remember these were the two lovebirds in Titanic. Here, their on-screen relationship is more real and fragile. They are flawed, and it is useless to assign blame as each one is genuinely trying to keep the marriage together in a low divorce rate era. Along with their first-rate chemistry, Michael Shannon gives a humorous performance as John Givings, a neighbor just released from a mental asylum with more sense than anyone in the movie.

All in all, Revolutionary Road is a meticulous study of a marriage in crisis. It works best if the viewer is prepared for a tragedy to question, learn from, or simply embrace.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Emotionally stimulating performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet make this a rewarding domestic drama,10/8/2019,Screen_Blitz,17-四月-17,"Revolutionary Road is an emotionally blistering drama that tackles on mature subjects such as infidelity, abortion, and the struggle of following life-long dreams. It is honest, it is poignant, and it offers somewhat uncomfortable message about the difficulties of marriage when desires are not reached. Director Sam Mendes is the leader of bringing about this potent domestic drama and reuniting 'Titanic' stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet as lovers. The romance between the two stars however, is slightly different story here. While the blockbuster film showcases the blossoming romance between Dicaprio and Winslet, this film goes the opposite route, and does so by tackling the sad, but significant issues that can leave marriage, or perhaps a whole family clinging on the edge of divorcement. With an intelligent direction by Mendes and profound performances by the two leads, this movie makes for a solid work of art. Set in the 1950s, the film revolves around Frank (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (played by Kate Winslet), a Connecticut couple who's marriage is in turmoil and are struggling to deal with personal issues. April is struggling as a theater actress and is stuck as housewife, and Frank is working a white- collar job that he desperately can't stand and is having an affair with his co-worker. When they make plans to move to Paris where both can fulfill their life-long dreams, they see what they believe to be the light at the end of the tunnel for their marriage. But can they overcome their personal obstacles including April's unexpected pregnancy to succeed their goals?

This film does not aim to tug at your heart springs, but it does offer a heart-wrenching truth about the fragility of the family when a couple's marriage reaches a dark period, especially when considering how high America's divorce rate has skyrocket in the past six decades. The story explores the dynamics of our lead couple as they struggle to come to terms with the obstacles bar from achieving their desires. One of the major aspects the story tackles is the idea of feeling trapped in a world where life is barred with seemingly endless limitations. The problem between the Wheelers is not each other, but their struggle to find a satisfying life in the suburbs. When they make a plan to move the family to Paris, that is when they become touched with hope for their domestic dilemma. But as the story advances, it becomes more and more evident that achieving you dreams is not always as easy as it seems. This accounts to some emotionally jarring revelations. Although the film occasionally slips into the pitfalls of utter melodrama, it is brutally honest is portraying the atmosphere of a broken family. And the helping hands behind the emotional resonance is Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet who both showcase true grit and powerful sentimentality in their roles, not perhaps not on the line with the chemistry they showcased when they were lovers on a sinking ship. The lead couple is greatly supported by Kathy Bates who makes for a tremendous role as their mutual friend who provides comfort in the dark days of their marriage.

Revolutionary Road is a powerful domestic drama sparkling with riveting performances and an solid direction by Sam Mendes who embraces the material with strong intellect. This is certainly not a happy ride nor does it opens doors to much humor beyond the arresting melodrama, but that is a rewarding piece of work.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Devastating movie with amazing performances,10/8/2019,Veteransson,15-一月-17,"Sam Mendes returns with another picture following the lives of suburban families in America. In this one, the story is set in the 50's and takes place in Connecticut. No Kevin Spacey this time to steal the show, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make up for that. They respectively portray Frank and April Wheeler who form a couple after meeting in a bar and move to suburbs after April gets knocked up. The movie opens with this bar scene, where they both meet and April tells Frank that she wants to pursue a career as an actress. Next, we cut to a play April is in and from the look on Frank's face it wasn't a good one. The two of them get into a fight on their way home and it becomes clear that they aren't the same people that met in a bar.

The main themes of the movie, as it is mentioned in the movie, are emptiness and hopelessness. More precisely, the fight against it. We first saw Frank with some kind of confidence and excitement about the future on his face, but now he's not the man that would be noticed in a bar. As he goes to work he blends in with all the other men going to work, wearing their hats and gray jackets, just like him. He has lost his distinctiveness. April wanted to act but now has to settle for a life as a housewife. They are both unhappy, lost in the emptiness and hopelessness. The American dream grants everyone the right to the pursuit of happiness, but happiness is what the Wheelers struggle with, which leads to tensions and bad decisions within their household.

This particular struggle is depicted perfectly by Sam Mendes. You can feel and see the emptiness in their lives, also thanks to some brilliant performances. DiCaprio is perfect and gives one of his best performances, which says a lot. The way he expresses his frustrations was amazing, the way he desperately tries to hold back his anger reminded me of a cover trying to stay on the cooking pot while the damp of the coiling water pushes it away. Kate Winslet is as brilliant as DiCaprio is, she gives a devastating, but brilliant performance. She won that year an Oscar for her performance in 'The Reader', but she deserved it for this one as well. DiCaprio wasn't even nominated. Why, I do not know.

The movie is devastating, because it is so relatable. There are so many people living in their seemingly perfect lives, but desperately hoping for something more. Every year they grow older as their regrets start to accumulate. The Wheelers want to escape from this rut and decide to move to Paris, but deep down they know they're stuck, and will never become what they wanted to become back when they were young, back in that bar. Besides this devastating look on the suburban life, there are a few lighter moments. Sam Mendes luckily lightens the mood from time to time by pointing out the silliness of this suburban life in a subtle comedic way. Only, we could have used more of this.

Another strength of this movie, that simply has to be mentioned, is Michael Shannon. He plays this character, who's unfortunately only in the movie for a couple of scenes, that suffers from mental issues. If telling the truth is a mental illness, then this guy is a complete lunatic. With his character, the movie cleverly makes fun of the suburban families for being afraid of the truth to an extent that they send people who actually tell the truth for once to a mental institution. All right, there was something off with this character, perfectly portrayed by Michael Shannon by the way. It is however a shame that his character wasn't more present in the movie. The movie could have benefited from his refreshing presence.

The themes in this movie are intriguing and relatable, the screenplay did an excellent job in making us understand the inner desires and motivations of the characters. The cinematography was terrific as well, and so was the entire ensemble cast. Yet, somehow this depressing tone of the movie became a drag at times. Some lighter moments could have made this movie easier to watch. '12 Years a Slave' had also this continuous depressing tone, without any lighter moments, but still managed to be absolutely perfect. 'Revolutionary Road fails at this, because even though the overall message is devastating and conveyed perfectly, the story is unfortunately not interesting enough to make your care for 2 hours.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Unbelievably fabulous performances!,10/9/2019,davispittman,23-十一月-16,"Revolutionary Road (2008) is a movie that contains wonderful performances by Winslet and DiCaprio. I can't remember the last time I saw such wonderful acting! The intense fighting between the wheelers is so raw and real, absolutely nothing is held back in those scenes, which is the way it should be. Winslet and DiCaprio are the wheelers, who are a married couple with two children. Their marriage is on the brink of absolute disaster. Director Sam Mendes, who incidentally is Winslet's former spouse, directs beautifully here, he really captures the essence of this unhappy married couple, and the many problems they experience throughout the film. Many mature issues are tackled here, including infidelity and abortion. Kathy Bates is in the movie as well, she plays her role well, I mean what else could you expect from the great Kathy Bates. The script and dialogue is so wonderfully written, especially the dialogue between the two leads. Revolutionary Road is a very serious mature movie that is not meant for simple escapist entertainment. So if you are just looking to pass a couple hours by and be mindlessly entertained, then this definitely is not the movie for that. It is a great film that I 100% recommend, that is if you want a very serious, perfectly acted, well written movie. 9/10.",pos
Revolutionary Road,unhappily ever after,10/7/2019,SnoopyStyle,20-十一月-16,"It's early 60's in the suburbs of New York City. April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) are unhappily married with two kids. Her amateur acting career is a flop. He's bored going into NYC for office work and has an afternoon fling with younger worker Maureen Grube (Zoe Kazan) on his 30th birthday. Their neighbor friends Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) are just as unhappy. Their realtor friend Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) has son John (Michael Shannon) who recently got out of psychiatric hospital and April agrees to befriend him. April tells Frank about her wild idea to sell everything and move to Paris. He agrees and grows excited. Then his boss offers him a promotion and April gets pregnant.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite with her then-husband Sam Mendes as the director. It would be impossible and maybe ill-advised to repeat the characters in Titanic. That's not to say that it's not strange for Jack and Rose to keep yelling at each other. It is beautifully made. It is an unhappy watch done in the most expert way. It is seriously good work but it does make me sad. The other problem is that the kids are almost extras in this film. They are bound to be compelling characters but this film does not exploit them. There is a self-pitying self-indulgence about these people that ignoring the kids does fit.",neg

Revolutionary Road,You were swell.,10/6/2019,sharky_55,28-九月-16,"In speaking of his classic novel Revolutionary Road, Richary Yates sees it as an indictment of 50s America clinging onto the modest living that would see so many families safely through the middle class years, not lavishly but comfortably enough. He is on the Wheelers' side of things, and even as he punishes them he sympathises and looks harshly on the neighbours who would immediately be trash-talking the moment their back is turned. When I first read the novel I was much younger and as such very taken by the Wheelers' attempted flight into the sun. Conformity is the mortal enemy of youth, and naturally I too was cheering alongside the pair as they tried desperately to escape the suburban prison that stifled them. But now, years on, I recognise that the story is more complex than that. In showing how glum the middle-class existence is Yates (however intentionally or not) also reveals how very broken and flawed Frank and April are. The couple have internalised a quarter-life of misery, regret and missed opportunities so thoroughly that they clutch blindly at the first chance of a change, no matter how little they have thought of the risks and responsibilities they are leaving behind. Like that first sexual encounter they revel in the brief fervour of the decision, and when that breaks down, foolishly and falsely in empty affairs.

At least some of this has survived the tricky process of adaptation in Sam Mendes' film. Unlike the similar American Beauty, which had the camera caress and lavish the open spaces and spotless canvases of the more prosperous 90s, in Revolutionary Road the walls should compress and close in on the Wheelers. The compositions are sharp all the same, but not inspired. Mendes can't recreate the subtext of the novel in any other way except through flashy and shouty dialogue, which merely simplifies the entire struggle of the family. He has cut the suffocating hum-drum of the Shep and Millie dinners, and missed a vital opportunity to showcase how the environment reinforces the behaviour of the inhabitants of Revolutionary Road and any other street, lane, drive or alley of Connecticut. Mendes has no patience. Instead of allocating time for this to build up to almost agonising levels, he takes the lazy and novel route: flashbacks.

This is the fatal flaw of the film, to assign different versions of Frank and April Wheeler and try to rope us in with false visions of regret. The opening is warm and cosy, the two glamorous leads meet cute and are instantly blubbering on about their various dreams and aspirations (and later whistle and frolic on the lawn after their big decision). And then throughout the film we pull back to when they were younger and feistier and had ambition they can barely recall today. This of course goes against everything that Yates stood for - he wanted the Wheelers to break free from the monotonous conformity of their surroundings, not be designated as special, shiny snowflakes that are held back by those around them. What this results in is the film going down entirely the wrong path, wherein the fault is not within themselves but rather a vague aspect of luck and destiny dealing them a less than completely satisfactory card that eradicates their potential. Mendes can't even delivery fully on that front; the film strains to convince us that Frank is really the 'fine mind' that has been wasted in corporate, although this may just be a delusion of April's.

Winslet is more than capable of playing such a frightened and boxed- in mother and wife; her body is in an ever-bowed position, fretting and rising just enough to put on a weak smile, all the while hiding her quiet desperation and intentions behind it. It is unfortunate that the editing lays her out to dry by needlessly forcing comparison with the past version of April, the graceful and straight-postured aspiring actress. DiCaprio explodes externally as necessary, although the writing betrays his character by portraying his affair as something borne of his natural charm and debonair (we've seen this before, in Catch Me If You Can, Wolf of Wall Street, and so on) rather than an inevitability of the setting. And Michael Shannon is a fine actor wasted in a hokey role (or dramatic device) that bears the ridiculous implication that only the disabled could see through the farce of the suburban American dream, although Yates must bear some of this blame for this.

If there is an inspired moment of change it is something that does not happen until we are well acquainted with Frank and April Wheeler. After a big fight they run off to their respective corners; April the home and Frank the hotel room. It is only after Frank stumbles into that kitchen that I remembered they had two little girls also living with them; so magnified is their desperation and their insecurities within their egos that it effectively pushes their daughters out of the picture. The moment is such a damning reveal of their selfishness, and the lengths of their blind devotion to the Paris dream that all other responsibilities, most importantly parental, are completely forgotten.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Real and beautiful,10/9/2019,maria-u-e-larsson,12-五月-16,"This movie is a must see for anyone who ever had ambition to do something with their life, but got stuck with a job they didn't like, didn't have enough money to realize their dreams or who got bogged down by societal norms on what responsible adults should do once you settle down and have kids. If that's something you can relate to, this movie is for you.

It is a beautiful depiction of human expectations, ambition, compromise, identity and disappointment. I bet everyone at some point has felt as lost as Frank about what their purpose in life is or as disillusioned as April about the meaninglessness of a nice house and shiny furniture. This is all of that, and it will hit you in the stomach.

Leo and Kate put out some really good performances, and even though at times April might seem a bit loopy or Frank comes off as a bit of a jerk, it is all very believable and the audience still empathize with both characters. That's great writing, when you can see the choices a characters makes and disagree with them, yet understand fully how they ended up at that bottomless pit.

This is not a movie for the ones who prefer light entertainment, romance that conquers all or who are uncomfortable with the darker aspects of human behavior and psychology.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolution.,10/8/2019,anaconda-40658,19-三月-16,"Revolutionary Road (2008): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon: Another grand achievement by director Sam Mendes who recruits a number of key players from Titanic. Title hints at the false dream often followed that rarely prevails. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank whose job pays well yet leaves him unfulfilled. Kate Winslet plays April, a failed actress who desires a move to Paris yet her latest pregnancy and his promotion damper those plans. Well written yet conclusion is not overly satisfying. Directed by Mendes with many disturbing elements that render discussion. His previous films include such provocative pleasures as American Beauty and Road to Perdition. Much better solid acting by DiCaprio and Winslet on their second film, but like their characters in Titanic, they both end up in different places, only here it is a case of mental stability. Strong supporting work by Michael Shannon as the troubled son of the realtor who is blunt and unforgiving. Kathy Bates plays the cheerful realtor who attempts to welcome them despite her son's behavior. In many ways her disposition opens and closes the film. Michael Shannon steals his scenes as the high strung son of neighbors, and his behavior dictates a low level of comfort. Set in 1950's suburbia where the seemingly perfect lifestyle is a lonely road. Score: 8 / 10",pos
Revolutionary Road,Kate Winslet can do nothing wrong,10/10/2019,steffirahardjo17,3-九月-15,"Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actress of all time.

OK, Revolutionary Road is not a romantic movie, it is a tragic movie from the beginning to the end. I feel uncomfortable watching it alone, definitely not a couple's rom-com movie.

It is a disturbingly realistic imagery of marriage.

Great casting. Kate can do nothing wrong in terms of acting in this movie. Do not mix your emotion to her acting, because some people do.

Be a good critic and see her as an actress doing extremely great acting that you can HATE her and it applies to Leonardo DiCaprio as well.

Revolutionary Road,Things that can go wrong in a marriage...,10/10/2019,gheremond,19-八月-15,"Based on a theatrical play, Revolutionary Road tells the story of the Wheelers, who start out as the loving, dreaming couple only to become a pair of disillusioned, lying and selfish people engaging in acts of unbelievable cruelty to each-other in this train-wreck of a wedding. There is no gore to be seen, but the emotional effect is the equivalent of watching mutilated bodies in some war drama. Truly disturbing stuff. Avoid if recently engaged/married.

DiCaprio and Winslet are the two best actors of their generation and their combination here is electrifying. Mendes' best since American Beauty. Perhaps the best screen couple of the decade.

Revolutionary Road,A movie worth watching!,10/10/2019,nanda_tapias,28-二月-15,"The best feat about the movie is the acting, an excellent casting! Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in this movie is outstanding. The viewer can see the joy, pain, stress,anger that Leo's character i supposed to feel.. he conveys all these feelings through his acting. On the scenes where April says she does not love him anymore, all the mixed feelings that the character feels are conveyed through his acting. How he cried and yelled... I am amazed by this level of strong acting. Kate Winslet was made for this role, I can't picture another actress pulling off the role for this movie. I have not read the book, but from reliable sources i hear this movie is pretty close to the book. No characters added or not present. The movie itself is great. It is an interesting and intriguing story. I loved Kate Winslet's representation of April's character. The confusion and disappointment her character felt could be seen only through her facial expressions. It is one of those movies that simply feel real.",pos
Revolutionary Road,American Beauty: The 1950's Version,10/6/2019,brchthethird,12-一月-15,"Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD would like to be a scathing indictment of 1950s America and suburbia but unfortunately fails to say anything fresh, and its satirical edge is remarkably dull. Still, there were some fine performances and individual moments that stand out, not to mention the excellent filmmaking on display. The story is about the Wheelers, a couple who live in the Revolutionary Hill Estates, a Connecticut suburban community. On the outside their life looks idyllic, but underneath it all there is a deep dissatisfaction and resentment that begins to manifest itself. The banality of suburban life is not a new topic in literature or film, and this film does a good job getting the surface details right in order to make its point rather clear. However, I didn't feel like it did anything I haven't seen before in other films, like THE ICE STORM and Sam Mendes' own ""American Beauty."" In fact, this felt a lot like ""American Beauty,"" with the exception that it was set in the 1950s. Even the score was reminiscent of the one for that previous film. However, that one had a more arty feel that this film didn't have. Still, despite the (ironically) banal subject matter, this film was well put together on every front, both technical and performance-wise. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job playing their roles, although there isn't too much depth to their characters at all. There were a few smaller roles that had familiar faces behind them, but they also felt under-developed. By far the best performance in the entire film was a small role played by Michael Shannon, the temporarily institutionalized son of the couple who sold the house on Revolutionary Road to the Wheelers. His couple of scenes have that acerbic wit and bite to them that I wish had been more prevalent in the overall story, which felt downright sterile at times. From a technical standpoint, the film is flawless and the photography was beautiful, belying the ugliness of the atmosphere projected by its characters. Overall, I didn't hate this film but I didn't think it entirely justified its existence either. It does a good job of portraying suburban malaise, but at the end of it you have to ask ""So what?"" Still it made for a pleasant, if unspectacular, viewing experience and was capped off with the perfect ending.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A movie to think about at 30 40 50 ...,10/7/2019,hugop-362-503160,31-十二月-14,"Surprised at how close to real life this gets at points. Struggling with making sense of desire, dreams and expectations is not easy to portray. Questions are left open, which in itself is real. The movie touched some really sensible points and is worth the watch especially for a couple. The influence of random events on one's life is also related in a very realistic way. Jeff Nicols was great and DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are at their usual best when they are in love <3 Cuddle up on the couch, get a coffee ready turn the lights down and be ready for a open heart discussion after having your emotions stirred. A movie for that will not age too quickly as the issues are always green.

Revolutionary Road,American Beauty Part Two!,10/9/2019,g-bodyl,19-十一月-14,"Revolutionary Road is a very strong drama that focuses around the happiness, or I shall say unhappiness of a middle-class, married couple of seven years. While not reaching the heights of 1999's American Beauty, this film serves the same purpose. They both touch on the subject of the dour effects that some people have about their status and how they are not living life the way they want to. In other words, this film can serve as a prequel to the fore-mentioned film. But this is a well-acted, tense drama that stays true to the literary source novel.

Sam Mendes, who previously directed American Beauty, directs a film about a couple named Frank and April Wheeler. They are seemingly happy as Frank commutes to New York City for work and April is the typical housewife. But Frank despises his job and April is not pleased about how her life turned out to be. One day, she suggests moving to Paris. While reluctant, Frank finally agrees. But complications ensue which causes problems after problems and can the Wheelers survive these problems?

A film like this needs to rely on their actors and thankfully this film delivers. The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since their historic pairing in 1997's Titanic. They both are fantastic and their chemistry is as great as always. It's funny because in Titanic, you can see the romantic love. In this film, you can see the tough love. Michael Shannon delivers one of his best performances as the son of the realtors who suffers from mental issues. We also get good performances from Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, and David Harbour.

Overall, Revolutionary Road is an excellent film. It plays out to be a small-town drama, but it goes bigger than that. I liked how this film can be described as a poor-man's American Beauty. It essentially is, but they are both excellent, unique films. The cinematography and costume design is great and same can be said for Thomas Newman's quiet, but excellent score. This is a really good movie built around the talents of Leonardo and Kate. I rate this film 9/10.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,10/9/2019,blanche-2,20-九月-14,"Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in ""Revolutionary Road,"" a 2008 film directed by Sam Mendes. The film also features Kathy Bates and John Givings.

It's 1955. Frank and April Wheeler have been married seven years, live in the Connecticut suburb and have two children. Frank works for a company that his father worked for, and he hates his job. April is a stay-at-home mom who wanted to be an actress.

While it might look good on the outside, this isn't the life either one envisioned. But April has an idea. They have enough money saved so that they can move to Paris, a city Frank loves. She can get a job as a secretary, which pays very well over there, and Frank can stay at home and decide what he really wants to do with his life. It sounds possible but maybe not practical, though Frank ultimately agrees to it.

Frank can't seem to find the right moment to give his notice; and then April discovers that she is pregnant. What now? There are lots of layers in this emotionally resonant, magnificently acted film. It's very much a story of its time for several reasons. The first is that it's obvious that April suffers from very bad depression. Though post-war psychological problems were recognized, actual depression, especially in a woman, probably wasn't given much attention. It was the returning soldiers who had suffered trauma who had the psychiatric focus. If by some means she had been discovered to have clinical depression, the medicine was horrible.

The second thing is that it was 1955. The ideas of picking up and moving to Europe with your family and the woman as breadwinner were outrageous back then. Now, not so much.

The third reason is that April at least had an artist's mentality and an artist's way of looking at the world. In this world, we have the practical and the artist, as in the O'Neill play Beyond the Horizon, where one brother is a farmer and the other brother is a poet who dreams of going out to sea. The problem is, there's no way to kill those attributes, and if you try, you won't be happy. April shouldn't have been married, shouldn't have been living in the suburbs, and shouldn't have stayed home.

Frank is more practical, though he'd like to be different, would like to do something he loves, if only he knew what that was. April thought he was cosmopolitan, adventurous, and that together, they'd be special. The idea that they're not special is something she can't tolerate.

This is such a fascinating movie about life's disappointments, punctuated with some humor by Kathy Bates as Mrs. Givings, a loquacious woman, whose son (Michael Shannon) has been institutionalized. When he meets the Wheelers, he has an uncanny way of speaking exactly the truth no one wants to hear. Shannon does a fantastic job in these disturbing scenes.

A shattering movie. I like to be entertained in films. I feel like we all have so much to reality to face, why not be able to turn away from it - but a beautifully realized film like this about dysfunction - somehow, I don't mind.",pos
Revolutionary Road,The Titanic duo is back and bang on with their acting skill,10/7/2019,Yellow_under_the_feet,3-八月-14,"Revolutionary Road is a 2008 American drama film, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, directed by Sam Mendes. This is the second collaboration between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who previously co-starred in Titanic. Her performance earned Kate Winslet a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a further three Golden Globes, four BAFTAs and three Oscars. The film is lavishly dark. It tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different. They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.",pos
Revolutionary Road,More like an alternative universe for Rose and Jack Dawson Titanic 2 minus the shipwreck,10/5/2019,lisafordeay,14-七月-14,"So this was on TV last night and it wasn't a bad film. It stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio both starred in my favourite live action movie of all time Titanic. Here they play a 1950's couple who aren't happy together as they fight and argue and April(Winslet)gets pregnant and Frank(Caprio) is both shocked and doesn't want it and April gets mad at him and he doesn't want her to get rid of the baby and yeah you can sorta tell what is gonna happen after this.

The story wasn't bad,the acting was great,Winslet was great as April,while Leonardo was good as Frank.

If you love old fashioned movies than check it out.

Overall its a 5 out of 10 for me. Nowhere good as Titanic but not that bad.",pos
Revolutionary Road,superb vehicle for Leo and Kate,10/10/2019,suzanne-sellers,14-四月-14,"I just don't see how this film could be any better. The cinematography, the script, the score and the characters ring 100% true throughout. There aren't many films that actually make the viewer cry because they can empathize so much with the lead characters. I felt a personal loss at the end when April dies. And di Caprio's reaction was absolutely tragic. These two actors are completely in sync with each other and it shows in the believability of the films they make.

I think that Alice was totally incapable of being the suburban housewife She simply could not continue when her dream of moving to Paris was destroyed. Honestly, I'm not sure why she did what she did - whether she intended to commit suicide or just terminate her pregnancy. It seems to the viewer that she had options, but a person in such a situation doesn't see the options and that is the tragedy.

I thoroughly enjoyed the supporting actors, especially the neighbor ""Shep"" who was in love with April and could not express his devastation at losing her. The realtor's son John who is on leave from the insane asylum is marvelous and provides the role of ""Greek chorus"" you might say. Speaking the truth but in a non socially-acceptable manner. He is a breath of fresh air in the strait-jacket life of those around him.

I haven't read the book, but a notable theme seems to be that people who can't conform in that time and place have two options: insanity or death.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Masterpiece,10/10/2019,grantss,21-三月-14,"Another masterpiece from Sam Mendes, maker of the brilliant ""American Beauty"" and other good movies such as ""The Road to Perdition"" and ""Jarhead"".

Similar to American Beauty in that it examines 20th century suburban life - its trials, tribulations, pressures, superficialities, tradeoffs and choices. Very emotional and thought-provoking.

Excellent writing and direction. Superb acting by Kate Winslet, as you would expect, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon are excellent in their supporting roles.

Infinitely better than the last movie Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio made together. You know, the vastly over-rated one with the big unsinkable ship that sank and where Leo died of hypothermia, even though he was King of the World. Yeah, that one... Sorry to remind you of it.",pos

I thought that with the two of them starring in this movie, you couldn't go wrong. I saw the other reviews and people raving about it, but I just didn't get it.

That being said, I just felt I was watching two depressed married people yelling at each other. First they seem to be happy about their move to Paris, then all of a sudden, they are at each other's throats. She has an affair with the neighbor. Is Leo happy that she is pregnant so that they don't move? I don't know - and what was the storyline with Kathy Bates and her crazy son. Was he the only person that saw through Leo and Kate's relationship? I just felt that there really wasn't a point to this whole movie -",neg
Revolutionary Road,bitter reality,10/8/2019,chnshetty,14-九月-13,"Revolutionary road is yet another masterpiece from Sam Mendes. The film starts with suburban couple who just don't love what they are doing . April who had dreams of becoming an actress gave up as nothing was working out for her . Her husband Frank whose ambition was as he says "" to feel things"" lives a artificial life. He works not because he loves doing it but to support his family. The couple looked perfect for the outside world . But they were so unhappy within that they were in the verge of an emotional collapse. April soon realizes that this was not meant to be what they had to do with their lives.So she decides to go to Paris where she can take a secretarial job while Frank can figure out what he would want to do with his life. Frank at first was at first reluctant and then agreed . But then actual story begins when everything goes against them ,unseen circumstances April getting pregnant, Frank getting promotion.Frank was the first one to dig his own grave as he starts saying ""this is just an option"". But April was so determined that she even decides to drop the child. Its a bitter reality but its true. Here everything seemed perfect for the couple when they planned,they were determined and both had a same mindset.But then Frank gets so absorbed that he had to change his mind.There are many stereotypes for this ""Lets be practical"",""pragmatic"",""Lets look at the options"",""face the reality"",""you know even i had the same dreams but then"". In fact Michael Shannon the crazy guy slams on Frank's face when he heard of change of plans.Campbell couple thought it was a crazy idea but then they were even scared to accept the fact themselves.The movie title is also very intriguing with a flavor of sarcasm.

Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road Review,10/7/2019,FilmGuy34567,5-七月-13,"If you took Mendes' ""American Beauty"", then sucked the contemporary setting and satirical bite out of it, you would get this film he made nearly a decade later. That is not to say that he is overly-repetitious or that this is a bad film by any measure. It is a powerful, well-written movie with two Oscar worthy performances by two stars well-known for their romance on the Titanic. Here they play a couple on the opposite side of the love spectrum, two people growing sick of each other and their plain and boring lives. The drama that results is so realistic and so spastic that it will shock you. The only problem with the movie is its lack of timeliness. This movie would have been revolutionary had it been filmed in the sixties or even in the seventies, but with dozens of suburban angst films proceeding it, ""Revolutionary Road"", just like its two main characters is bound to get lost in the shuffle.

Is April wrong for wanting something different out of life? This movie really makes you wonder about your own life. What are you looking for? Do you just want to marry and settle down in a small town, or do you want to live in the big city? Do you want kids or do you need to be free? Do you need adventure, to get out of your comfort zone, to explore the world? In my own way I can relate to April's feelings, she felt trapped in her own perfect life. A life that she didn't want, a life she felt didn't belong to her. Only the possibility of breaking out of it made her feel alive again, and as her dream of living the life she wanted got destroyed, so did she.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Definitely Not One To Be Missed,10/7/2019,venusahmed,2-五月-13,"Directed by Sam Mendes, this piece of great cinematography does not disappoint. Kate Winslet and Leanardo Di Caprio were yet again reunited on-screen to give another great performance (as expected). The duo delivered in this emotional and deep drama about life, family, happiness, dreams, hardships and most of all sacrificing for what is important. The film just goes to show what the realities of life are; that life can look and seem perfect until you look within yourselves and unless you're happy with who and where you are, nothing is perfect. The music, the script and the acting go so well hand-in-hand to create an accurate representation of that era. A great watch; definitely not one to be over-looked!

Revolutionary Road,Bitter-sweet suburbia,10/7/2019,Lejink,10-四月-13,"Of course the last time Leo and Kate made a film together, they played youthful star- crossed lovers in a doomed relationship. Here, they are older and altogether disenchanted, although again the outcome is doomed. The former of course was ""Titanic"", for me an overblown, badly-written melodrama but here we have a warts and all examination of a stale marriage set in mid-50's ""I like Ike"" suburban USA, based on a modern literary classic. The special effects are certainly better in the film about the ship but I know which I prefer.

The film is an up close study of a marriage going wrong. On the face of it this youngish couple should be happy, like their neighbours seem to be. They have a nice house, he has a steady job, they have two kids and are considered the perfect couple. But like the song says, in every dream home a heartache and so it proves.

After dissecting the modern American marriage to a degree in ""American Beauty'"", Sam Jaafe (Winslet's husband at the time) gets the scalpel out again for this movie set some 50 years before. Some aspects however, whilst I appreciate they are in the original novel, don't work for me, in particular the introduction of the recently institutionalised son of an older neighbourly couple, who is there to point out the flaws in the Wheeler marriage which we presumably somehow mssed in the preceding hour. Add to that he uses some downright abhorrent phrases that only repel rather than enlighten with his parents saying nary a word against him.

I also feel De Caprio is miscast here. He looks too baby-faced for the part of the treacherous husband but Winslet does well as the frustrated wife who can only find release from her straitjacket with the most extreme of solutions.

Nevertheless the film has a gathering power as it builds up to its desperate climax and makes for strong, sobering viewing.",pos
Revolutionary Road,a deep meaning and insight into the film - more to it than a lot of films. oh and amazing acting.,10/9/2019,hroberts199032,19-一月-13,"its a great film with amazing acting. the second time watching it I've realised even more how deep it is. its interesting how different people SEE the movie. some people see April as selfish but truth is; April was behaving so unselfishly that she was prepared to work as a Secretary as oppose to her dream of an actress all so that Frank could find out what he really wanted to do with his life cause she knew how unhappy he was with his life and job - he was just putting on a fake show of happiness like all the other people living there. the film is about being real and true to yourself and i think it shows a lot about a person as to how differently they see this movie. brilliant and quite soul- affirming actually.. :)

Revolutionary Road,When roses dry,10/7/2019,LloydBayer,1-十一月-12,"How do you dissect a seemingly perfect relationship? How thin is the line between love and hate? Danny DeVito attempted an answer to these questions in ""The War of the Roses"". So did Roman Polanski in the controversial ""Bitter Moon"". Director Sam Mendes not only answers these questions but goes on to prove that every relationship feeds expectations, but the real question is how much are you willing to compromise to keep those ever so minute cracks from growing on that all too perfect wedding portrait.

Hypothetically speaking, what if a couple of young lovers where to survive a massive ship wreck over the icy Atlantic, get married, and settle down in middle class suburbia. What would their marriage seem like somewhere around the dreaded seven year itch? With absolutely no reference to the ""Titanic"", Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are cast together again, this time as Frank and April Wheeler, a perfect couple in the eyes of friends and neighbors. Frank is an average nine to fiver at a city office and April is a homemaker aspiring to be an actress. While the possibility of living the American dream seem far out of reach, the Wheeler's plan on moving to Paris for what would hopefully be a much better life. April would find a good job to support the family while Frank would reflect on his true calling. Though a simple plan, negative vibes soon start to tear the very fabric of their relationship. Some of these include disapproving and jealous neighbors, severely bruised egos and even the slight case of infidelity. To make matters worse, April conceives for the third time, throwing the metaphorical spanner into the works, turning what was once love and adoration into utter loathing.

DiCaprio and Winslet does it again. A power house performance by the two leads would be an understatement, given this film was nominated for three Oscars amongst other nominations and awards. Add to that an ensemble lineup of supporting roles from Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, Michael Shannon and even Kathy Bates (also starred in the Titanic). Film noir fans will welcome this remarkable movie from Sam Mendes, especially after his dark tale of a dysfunctional family in ""American Beauty"".

Couples watching this movie will find it hard to take sides. Both Frank and April are characters that could be any John and Mary. Adapted from Richard Yates' novel of the same name, costumes, sound track and cinematography are flawlessly integrated into a script that paints a vivid picture of what life leading up to the golden years was all about.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Unhappy Wife Model,10/6/2019,seniorbayir,19-九月-12,"Well, Kate Winslet plays the role of a woman that you should have never married at all. She's all sad, unhappy even at small things. She wanna go and live in Paris, far away from where they live; and want to believe that everything gonna be extremely alright there, but nothing will be OK if they stay in America. I wouldn't imagine a wife that imposes me to leave all things, pack up and go anywhere she wants just because she feels unhappy.

Roleplaying, emotional effects etc were good but one of the important missing parts in this drama is the children and their response to the arguments, fights going in family. They didn't seem to be a 4-person family to me.",pos
Revolutionary Road,'It takes courage to live the life you want'.,10/9/2019,jharper-331-109078,30-四月-12,"Revolutionary Road is a stunning film based in 1950s America, yet it holds a universal message of love and life.

The plot revolves around the struggling relationship of April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's a great reunion of these two, both portraying their characters' clashing emotions fantastically right from the start. I love how the film begins with an argument, foreshadowing the constant issues that the couple have.

The iconic book on which the story is based may explain the 1950s setting yet it almost gives reason for the entrapment that they both feel; today it would be acceptable for the couple to separate, whereas then it may have been frowned upon, forcing them both to stay in this 'endless hopelessness'.

The use of music works for both the ups and the downs of their lives. A creepy, slow paced, soft piano score which seems both happy and sad and, if you've seen the film before, reminds you of the traumatic ending the whole way through, heightening the sense of reality amongst the appearance of their perfect 1950s lives. I feel a connection to Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby with this idea; a lot of things in the 1950s are portrayed as idealised, people living their perfect lives with their perfect wives and children, but the reality is much more negative.

The use of costume gives a sense of uniformity, especially during the train station scene when Frank Wheeler seems lost amongst a sea of grey and tan suits and hats. It symbolises his inability to break free from uniformity, from the expectations that life has, an inability to become that 'something special' that Helen keeps saying they have. Frank seems as alone here as April does in her house on her own day after day. They both feel alone in their relationship and in their lives generally; it's as much a story of love which cannot work as it is a story of the expectations people have of what their lives should be, and the inability to break free from this. It gives the audience a universal message of the struggle for happiness in both love and life and, as quoted from the film itself, the fact that 'it takes courage to live the life you want.'",pos
Revolutionary Road,"""Revolutionary Road"" Dreamworks Pictures",10/8/2019,annuskavdpol,27-二月-12,"""Revolutionary road"" teaches us that life is not always what is seems. The title of the movie is a contradiction. It means 2 different things. A lot of time in life, things do mean 2 different things at the same time. A lot of the time, things in life are not ""this way"" or ""that way"", instead they can be a combination of both sides. Thats what I think this movie is about.

In the movie the two lead characters came to a cross roads and needed to make a decision. Once the decision was made, things seemed to happen to them - in a very unexpected way. In a way both of the characters changed. Or did they take on each others' reciprocated personalities - like a chameleon - like a reflection in the mirror?

Revolutionary Road,Like the Paris scenes,10/6/2019,Bleeker-R,7-二月-12,"In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the ""emptyness and hopelessness"" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.

The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded. Instead the movie becomes overly depressing and cynical not living up to its potential.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Shattered dreams of all the Ordinary lives,10/9/2019,prince_c3,30-十一月-11,"Well, just shot of giving 10/10 for lots of reason because I strongly believe that nothing is perfect and giving 10/10 mean that its perfect, like they way Frank and April Wheeler think about their lives in suburb Connecticut. This novel is about the lives which was true in 1950's and its true in every era, its timeless. The dreams of ordinary middle class suburban peoples, their lives around their houses and dreams. But the same people wanted to achieved those dreams and try to fulfill those promises but in the end, they forced by every possible circumstances to live the lives they hate about. They have to work to the place they hate about it, but they just cant control those things. AS THE LIFE IS A DIAMOND, AND ALL THEY HAVE TO LICK THAT DIAMOND EVERYDAY AND LIVE. Some people cope better by lying to themselves and some people couldn't cope in best possible way and like their dreams their lives will shattered in thousands pieces of glass. Frank cope and understands the practicality of his life and his family life, he worked hard at every opportunity and already compromised to the life, to the future he has to end up with, but his wife tried another way out, the whole new future and wanted to give a try, a try too hard and when she sees no hope of that future and that dream she took extreme step. As far as movie is concern Sam took the book and made the movie as close as possible, he literally took back to 1950's. Acting wise, well, I was hoping a brilliant performance by Kate by all means and of course she performed brilliantly, but the one actor who did more than his fare share of role, it was Leonardo, he just blow me away with his acting. He acted so well, in the role of Frank that, you will feel sympathy, sorry and sorrow for Frank and Leo made it possible. Its so sad that neither Kate nor Leo got an Oscar for this which they rightly deserve. This is one movie which always be in the top 10 list of most depressing movies.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A Movie About How Reality Affects One's Dreams And Desire For Change,10/10/2019,Desertman84,7-十月-11,"Revolutionary Road is a very realistic movie about a couple whose reality has affected their dreams and desire for change.It is an interesting movie because it provides a glimpse of what many people are experiencing these days in tough and hard economic times.

Frank and April Wheeler,played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet,are in their seventh year of their marriage.Sad to say,their life is filled with unhappiness and it is far from perfect.They live in the Connecticut suburbs with two young children. April has forgone her dream of becoming an actress, and Frank hates his job. Then one day, she suggests that they move to Paris as a means to rejuvenate their personal lives and their marriage.She plans to be the breadwinner by becoming a secretary of a major international organization,while he would have free time to find himself.In the end,their plans went for naught as April had an abortion and Frank admitted that he was having an affair which ultimately was detrimental to both themselves and their marriage.

Many people could relate to the couple's predicament due to the recession that the country is currently experiencing.The theme of the movie can be realistic as it can get.And the movie portrayed that very well.The acting was excellent as the two Titanic stars,Di Caprio and Winslet,were definitely honest in their portrayals as the Wheelers.Sam Mendes' direction was superb and excellent.Overall,this film is highly recommended and would definitely a great film for people these days.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Powerful drama,10/10/2019,haterofcrap,1-九月-11,"This was such a great film. Unlike many other boring ""oscar-bait"" films, this actually deserved all the praise it received.

This film was made by Sam Mendes, the same director of the overrated ""American Beauty"" (But he also made two good films, such as ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Away We Go"") I must admit that when I heard about this film for the first time, I wasn't very interested about it, because I thought it was going to be like ""American Beauty"", but in the Fifties, but this movie turned out to be pretty good, with many powerful and emotional scenes.

The performances were excellent, and the cinematography was equally good too.

Personally, I think that ""Revolutionary Road"" was an excellent film, and I found this to be superior in every single aspect to American Beauty. This is a good, underrated film that deserves more recognition.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Quick review,10/7/2019,ant-j-sib,8-二月-11,"This is a slightly weird movie. It has a feeling of being written and acted for the stage, and Leonardo is very good, as you might expect, but Kate falls down because of her poor American accent. They seem to have pretty good chemistry, and I would rate this much higher if it were not for the accent business. This is where my review ends. I don't have any more to say about it but am apparently required to write at least 10 lines, which is kind of annoying. Not having 10 lines worth of material doesn't necessarily mean your review is not worthwhile. Now I'm going to have to think of all sorts of useless junk to write here, and possibly have my account blocked. But if that's the way the cookie crumbles, so be it.

Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road,10/8/2019,francescof86,29-一月-11,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a brilliant ,engaging and a devastating movie(with a great direction) ,near to perfection, from one of the most original and amazing director(Sam Mendes).It is based on a beautiful and touching book from Richard Yates. What I found interesting is the portrayal of the broken dreams of Frank(Leonardo Dicaprio in an under-appreciated stellar performance)and April(a terrific performance by Kate Winslet)and their struggles. Of course,there are not totally positive or negative characters(although April can be cruel in a way that Frank can't be)but overall I believe that both of them are simply too selfish to admit clearly what's wrong with them.The story is a clever example of people that are not capable to live a seemingly wealthy existence, in particularly April who shows ominous signs of mental illness. Sam Mendes is one of the best director.His movies are honest and occasionally shocking. He's not afraid to bare the souls of the characters he describes.The script is truly great and allows the actors to display their abilities.For his terrific performance Leonardo DiCaprio was not even considered for a Best Actor nomination which I consider a real shame since the role is very demanding and he completely disappears inside it.Kate Winslet shows once again why she is one of the best actress of her generation and she wasn't nominated for an Oscar just because she was up for that award with another great performance in The reader.The supporting cast adds very much to the general beauty of the movie.Michael Shannon and Kathy Bates are just priceless. The picture deserved an Oscar nominations for Best movie and Best director given the polished work Mendes did,one of the most daring and competent director we have.My vote is 8/10.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Why do people say this movie is so depressing - get a life!,10/10/2019,porgiamor,24-七月-10,"I agree with previous reviewer who wrote that watching this movie sure beats going to therapy. Another reviewer concluded that relationships are tough - I couldn't agree more. That is what revolutionary road is about folks! I have nothing but praise for Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslett and Sam Mendes. This is a great movie with superb acting, music score, scenery, costumes, set design - everything top notch. I saw The Hurt Locker recently and found that movie so utterly depressing. This movie was not. I believe the whole point of this movie is to ask those deep philosophical questions of oneself such as, what makes you feel inspired and alive every single minute of everyday? What's your ultimate purpose in life? What motivates you? What makes you special? Personally, I found this movie very helpful, and for me, the moral of the story is this: Life continues no matter how hopeless it feels. I would suggest watching A Serious Man after this movie.

Revolutionary Road,"Don't give up your dreams, don't become responsible adult",10/8/2019,CoBarbarella67,15-七月-10,"The book and the movie ask a fundamental question: do we choose to live our life to the fullest and fulfill our dreams or do we settle for the far from glamorous suburban life of reasonable adults in a society tailoring our dreams in order for us to buy more of the bullshit it sells. It is brilliantly acted, scripted and directed, you'll see the couple drowning in his incapacity to take a chance and live the dream instead of dreaming their life thus feeling bitter and acrimonious about it. In the 50's you would think the decision of not living the dream reasonable, in today's world, we know we're lied to, deceived by ""the markets"" and the advertorials so we may as well do as we dream, because it does not matter, society is not designed to make us happy (not even happy customers !), fulfilled so if you have a passion, just go for it, live every minute of it, regardless of tomorrows. Actors are fantastic, director Mendes has brilliantly filmed this sad story. Don't watch it if you're already depressed ;-)

Revolutionary Road,"""People Are On To The Emptiness. But It Takes A Someome With Guts To See The Hopelessness""",10/8/2019,johnstonjames,30-六月-10,""" someone with guts to see the hopelessness"". oooh. ouch. take that America and stick up your suburb. fortunately there is hope in that statement. it simply means that there is a whole world beyond the all-American middle class dream which, these days, sort of seems like a pipe dream. it feels like most people in American can't see out of their own little box, cubicle, tract-home or club. that's why things are so stagnant. and we keep letting the same status-quo mediocrities dictate mores and beliefs with out ever questioning them because everyone is so afraid to be different and march to their own drummer. i mean who really wants to feel like the odd man out? take it from most of us who are different. it's hard.

taking a good, hard look at yourself and the environment around you is usually a pretty enlightening experience. you can, however, be a little too hard on yourself and things. Richard Yates book and Sam Mendes film is perhaps that, but it does offer insights you usually won't get from most media in this country. i never read Yate's American classic, but i do know Mendes, and viewing things from a hard perspective is what Mendes does best. look at 'American Beauty' and what excellent but hard, stern film that was. not all of America lives up to Walt Disney's idealistic vision of this country. not everything is okay with suburbia, marriage and the ""American Dream"".

it's a little spooky when the only character in a play that seems sane is the crazy guy. beautifully played by Michael Shannon (was he nominated for this? he should have.)and it's equally disturbing to think death is the only way out.

so much of the film is summed up in the end scenes where the couple next door decides ""we won't talk about the Wheelers again"". classic case of American denial.",pos
Revolutionary Road,On the Road Far From Heaven in a Ice Storm,10/9/2019,glennw53,20-六月-10,"Sam and the rest of the cast can do no wrong in my book so I'm ashamed I didn't see it when it came out until now. I think because of the subject matter I knew it wasn't going to be a light hearted film. I dreaded it in a way but I new it would be good for the soul. So I was born in the 50's and the settings and colors are spot on. Deakins is a master of course. Life in America after the war when were young and invincible and the feeling of optimism of a new world. Some are not cut out for cookie cutter world of picket fences and 2.3 children. Some of us plan to set the world on fire and be all we could be. Some just planned and fate intervened. Every generation is this way. Some times we get stuck in not what we wanted. April is one of those stuck people. Frank didn't mind it too much, it came easy to him. When I look back on the street I grew up on I realize maybe 3 out of 30 couples stayed to together by the time the 70's came along. For most it doesn't come easy. Will we alway have Paris?

Revolutionary Road,The Little House on Revolutionary Road.,10/10/2019,tommyboymccoy,26-五月-10,"Revolutionary Road is the far most one of the best novels of the decade.I first read the book about a year ago.Than my friend told me that they were coming out with the movie, so i had to see it.The Highly respected actress Kate Winslet(My Favorite Actress) did a phenomenal job of play April Wheeler,she really looks like the character and portrayed her so well just like the book.April Wheeler played a pregnant suburban house wife and is sick of her boring life so she decides to move to Paris.Leonardo Di Caprio plated Frank Wheeler who is sick of his non interesting job and is in love with his wife April Wheeler.There is such a good cast in this movie, Kate Winslet,Leo,Kathy Bates,Michael Shannon and so much more.I really suggest this movie to ANYONE.But i do suggest also to read the book because the movie does leave out a lot of characters and a lot of detail. So rent this movie buy it borrow it or whatever get this movie it will change you in so many ways.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Sometimes hard to watch but hypnotic, rewarding drama",10/10/2019,thundrmi,18-五月-10,"I'll try hard not to reveal too much about the plot, but I know I'll slip, so see the film first if endings are of utmost importance to you..

I must admit that the first time I watched Revolutionary Road(RR), I commented to others that I did not find the experience a pleasant one. Thank heavens I did not allow my initial response to a less than typical 'Hollywood ending' to prevent me from giving the film a second screening. Upon reexamination, I have concluded that this is truly one of the most intense, gripping and thought-provoking dramas of the last decade (or beyond).

A second viewing afforded the opportunity to watch, with great interest, the absolutely masterful performances of Winslet and DiCaprio, supported ably by a wonderful cast. With RR, the acting is the key. Of course Sam Mendes' directorial effort showcases these performances and brings Yates' epic novel critiquing 50's suburban life into sharp focus.

The era of the mid 1950's is very well presented in this film, with a great soundtrack, spot-on architecture, sets and costumes. It helps set-up a love/hate relationship with that 'innocent' decade while allowing the story to play out in contrast. Tunes from the film,including another Oscar caliber theme by Thomas Newman and fifties hits like Crying in The Chapel and Count Every Star haunted me for weeks, finally leading to a purchase of the soundtrack. DiCaprio, now a mature actor far from the boyish Jack, is paired again with his accomplished co-star from Titanic, Kate Winslet, in the role of Frank Wheeler. Wheeler and wife April (Winslet) met in the post WWII years, shared dreams of great futures and shared a disdain for typical suburban life before settling, themselves, in suburban Connecticut. What follows is an examination of how differently these two handle leading what they once regarded as dull and generally inferior lives. April is emotional and passionate about her early ideals while Frank seems to have learned to accept 'success' in the white collar world. At times, April seems to hate her spouse for abandoning early shared dreams, while Frank desperately wants to retain April's love and respect. Some emotionally supercharged scenes ensue.

I must mention one co-star in particular. Kathryn Hahn is amazing as Milly Campbell, the Wheelers' next door neighbor and spouse to Shep(David Harbour), Frank's best friend. Both do a tremendous job portraying the typical, happy suburban couple with insecurities and passions restrained in a way unthinkable to April. Hahn is worth watching closely in key scenes where the Wheelers share some unconventional plans to regain their lost goals. Her facial expressions are priceless.

If you appreciate fine acting,intense adult drama played out in harsh reality,RR is for you. Even if you saw it once and reacted negatively to a rather shocking conclusion, watch it again and simply enjoy the professionals who act a true masterpiece. Leo and Kate have never done better.",pos
Revolutionary Road,The dark side of suburbia,10/8/2019,freemantle_uk,14-五月-10,"For a British director Sam Mendes seems to have a great understanding of American culture and he has a great interest in the darker side of American culture. Mendes reunions Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio for this dark, gritty piece of Americana set story.

Winslet and DiCaprio play April and Frank Wheeler, a unhappy married couple that live in 1950s East Coast America in the suburbs. April was a failed actress and a housewife whilst Frank is an unhappy salesman for the same company his father work at. Outwardly people thing they are the perfect couple with a nice family; but no one knows what happens behind closed doors. Desperate for a chance April suggest to Frank moving to Paris so he can find himself and be happy in the city of live. April has plans on how the move would work and the two make serious preparations to move the family abroad. But event conspirer against April's plans and whilst the married couple have a brief period of happiness their relationship becomes very strained.

Revolutionary Road is an actor's film: it is filled with excellent performances with DiCaprio and Winslet at their best. They are believable as the couple of the piece and this is such a realistic scenario about how a relationship going wrong. The supporting performances were excellent, with people believing the illusion of the Wheelers and the other character seeming to have a need for it. This is most evident with the female characters Helen (Kathy Bates) and Milly (Kathryn Hahn).

Mendes handles the material, trying to balance out both April and Frank's good and bad part and they both change amongst themselves as the protagonist and the antagonist. He gets the best out the actors and his skill behind the camera adds to the power, like when April has to make a phone call and the camera moves away and April gives the audience a voice-over. Mendes could have easily have shot the film in a dark hand-held style which is popular at the moment. Yet Mendes kept he kept the film well lit and its offers a great juxtaposition of the nice setting of suburbia and the darkness of the relationship. There are excellent themes in the film, there is the idea of broken and unfulfilled dreams, an important aspect in some of American literature like Of Mice and Men. There is the obvious film of a relationship going wrong, with the people starting a family and creating a home just because it's the normal thing, not because it's the best thing to do. As well the film looks at the idea of illusion that people will put up to protect themselves and other people believing it. Revolutionary Road was very much like American Beauty, looking at the dark underbelly of American suburbia, but this time, set in the 50s.

Whilst the film is very strong for the most part, they could have shown a little more about how the relationship broke down in the first place and the children did not play a big a role as they should have.

Revolutionary Road is a melodrama: but it's an very good melodrama and sometimes that is what the audience needs.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Hopeless emptiness,10/8/2019,iradao,11-五月-10,"The drama is about a couple played by Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. When he meets her (April) he already says he works only for the money, without any passion. She, in other hand, dreams to be an actress.

But she is not talented and her career doesn't emerges. Every problem they have, the man starts some discussion and the woman tries to avoid it, in contrary to the usual, a typical change of roles.

Years later he keeps working in an unpleasant job while she is a housewife with two children. They live a tepid life without any big emotion and both keep fighting each other.

But one day, after a big fight where he seems very angry, April finds a photograph of him in Paris and a dream rises. She convinces him to go live in Paris and they tell everybody in town. Nobody seems to understand this immature idea, except the psychotic man called John. He is the one that understand the hopeless emptiness that rule their hearts. However it seems that the emptiness is stronger in the woman than in the man.

The woman than acts like an actress in her real life. In her last breakfast she is a great actress and the husband really enjoys it, even though I think he could realize that she wasn't being real, because of her great coldness.

After the movies end, I kept asking myself if I were in his skin, if I would have gone to Paris. This decision was foolhardy but I think he could convince his wife to go on vacation first, or something like that. He couldn't just say her plan, her dream was silly.

The main problem between the couple is that April dream about glamour and Frank was more realistic, more grounded.

Something I liked very much in the movie is the acting of Kathy Bates and the fact that she smokes a lot, even when pregnant. That was realistic because the time of the movie is around the fifties.

Something I didn't like in the movie was that even though they are parents of two children and some of their problems is because of them, the kids rarely appear in the screen. Other thing I didn't like was the scene he tells her wife that he has cheated on her.

But overall I liked because the movie makes you think. Sam Mendes is really nice.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"The Real ""Leave it to Beaver""",10/8/2019,moviesleuth2,27-四月-10,"As human beings, we crave stability. The thought of sameness and certainty brings us a certain degree of comfort. But being comfortable and ordinary means sacrificing our chance to be truly extraordinary. To what degree do we give up our dreams for a sense of comfort and normalcy? Is an ordinary life worth giving up the chance to be someone special?

Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) are a happily married couple. Frank is a dreamer, and wants to go back to Paris because people are ""alive"" there, but after April became pregnant, they moved to the suburbs to live a normal life. But April is not happy as an ordinary housewife, and Frank is just as miserable having ended up in a job that he swore to avoid. So they decide to move to Paris so that they can live the life that they were ""meant"" to. But are they willing to take that chance?

In 1997, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet created one of the greatest screen romances of our time in ""Titanic."" Eleven years later, the real life best friends have returned on screen together in an entirely different kind of film. It is a credit to their skill and versatility that Frank and April Wheeler are NOTHING like Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater. DiCaprio and Winslet are wonderful in their roles. Both are trapped in a situation that they hate, but can't escape.

The other actors vary, however. Kathy Bates is miscast as Helen Givings, the only person who really seems to have fully bought into this sitcom-ish life. Bates is a good actress, but she's not right for the part. A cynic might say that this was to draw on the popularity of the ""Titanic"" connection, but I doubt it. ""Revolutionary Road"" will not appeal to that crowd, and the two leads are a strong enough appeal anyway (but with Hollywood, you never know...). Michael Shannon is excellent as John, Helen's son who was in the mental hospital for his opinion that this life that everyone seems to be living is a delusion. Shannon has made a career of off-the-wall performances, but this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the character sometimes comes off as a writer's construct than a real individual, and Shannon is unable to solve this problem. Of special note is David Harbour, who plays the Wheelers' next door neighbor and friend, Shep. It's a passionate and heartfelt performance, and it should grant Harbour some notice.

Sam Mendes already peered behind the white picket fence in ""American Beauty,"" which I have not seen. But there has been no greater criticism of the delusion portrayed by the classic 1950's sitcoms like ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"" than ""Revolutionary Road."" But the true strength of the film is that it applies to every era of American life; our dreams our precious, and we cannot reach them without taking a chance.",pos
Revolutionary Road,More feasible than American Beauty...,10/9/2019,yddsp@aol.com,10-三月-10,"As I settled into this movie, I began to sense a feeling of familiarity (I caught it a few minutes into it) with the subject matter, then I realized the setting and time-frame were not present day, they were, in fact, back in the 1950s. At first it seemed like an ordinary run-of-the-mill period piece, but as I allowed myself to be absorbed by the movie's theme and subject matter, I realized that it was quite an interesting story after all. In fact, it was, at times, disturbingly realistic, as I can speak from personal experience, having grown up within that same time period, when life was 'supposed' to be simpler. When I came to realize it was from the same Director as the film ""American Beauty"", I knew why it held my attention so, because this man can really tell an interesting story and is quite impressive as a creative artist. I won't say it was an entertaining experience, as the subject matter is not your typical feel-good fare, but it is a very compelling movie that I intend on watching from the beginning, and then over again, because it was so interesting. It is also much more plausible in terms of realism than its predecessor, American Beauty. Great job Mssrs. Mendes, DiCaprio, Shannon and Mss. Winslet, Bates et al!",pos
Revolutionary Road,"""Revolutionary Road"" - Leo and Kate on the screen together again...",10/10/2019,dee.reid,20-二月-10,"I believe that it was in early 2008 that I heard that a new film was coming out that would be pairing stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on the screen together again, 11 years after they were the king and queen of the world in ""Titanic"" (1997). That long wait happens again in the 2008 film ""Revolutionary Road.""

Now I'm a guy and I'm a sucker for romances, so that when I heard that the power-couple of ""Titanic"" were teaming up again for a new film due out later in 2008, you can bet that I waited with eager anticipation to see this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, in all likelihood, made film history with ""Titanic"" by becoming probably the new Hollywood screen couple. And while the two are together again in the Sam Mendes-directed ""Revolutionary Road,"" they are very much the complete opposite of the characters they made famous 11 years prior in ""Titanic.""

""Revolutionary Road"" is an adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, and concerns the Wheeler family, spear-headed by Frank (DiCaprio) and his wife April (Winslet), who live with their two children in a lovely New York suburb. Remembering that the two are the opposites of the characters they portrayed in 1997, their marriage is very much on the rocks from the opening moments. Set in 1955, they live a picturesque life as a picturesque, perfect American couple, you know, the type of unique American family that all the rest of American families should try to be like.

Things couldn't be any more farther removed from the truth.

Frank hates his job as a lowly tech salesperson, and has often dreamed of better things in life. April is pretty much the ideal housewife who does the incredibly simple task of making a decent home life for her family. April soon comes up with the idea that in order to get what they both want out of life, that it would be nice to move to Paris, France, and try to start over. She'll get a job as a secretary, she says, while Frank will stay at home with the kids and try to figure things out. It's a lovely dream, but a highly unrealistic one, and soon numerous factors (internal as well as external) come out that threaten to tear this already faulty family unit apart.

Now, I'm not one to really jump on the bandwagon of the latest Hollywood flick that's primed to sweep the Oscars. However, I found ""Revolutionary Road"" to be something that is a little bit higher than the usual Hollywood drivel. I found the missing link in most Hollywood pictures purely in the star-power of the two lead performers. It was a sight to see DiCaprio and Winslet together again. (I might as well as proclaim them as my ultimate, favorite screen couple.) That they're together again under different circumstances and playing vastly different characters than the ones they immortalized in ""Titanic"" is part of the experience. I found their characters to be brutally honest about themselves and inherently imperfect, but full-blooded and really life-like; essentially, they're real people here.

I like Leonardo DiCaprio. He is one of my favorite actors. He has shaped up in the time since ""Titanic"" to become one of the film community's most versatile and talented performers; he is no longer the ""King of the World"" boy-toy he was in ""Titanic's"" hey-day. (When is this man going to win an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe?) Kate Winslet proved to be the real winner here, since she won a Golden Globe for her performance here (as well as an Oscar for ""The Reader,"" which I haven't seen, but I say she should have won it for this film, too). Her performance is honest to begin with, but halfway through takes a turn down a much darker route that was totally unforeseeable by anyone in the audience.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a real movie, a real movie that is full-blooded and smart. I should have said this way earlier, but I had to watch the film for a college class recently, and it was my first time seeing it. I have no idea how I missed this movie while it was in the theaters. But I was glad I had the grand opportunity to see what was one of the best - if not the best - drama films of 2008.

Revolutionary Road,Gilded cage,10/8/2019,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,22-十二月-09,"I have not read the novel, nor, I believe, anything else by Yates, though I would like to. From what I understand, it does not delve as much into the female lead as this does. I knew that I wanted to watch this from the moment I saw the trailer, and it did not disappoint me in the least. There is so much poignancy and so many brilliant observations about human psychology, nature and relationships in this, and, without knowing with certainty, I can imagine that they can be traced back to the author of the book. This is immensely realistic, as well as rather authentic... it really does feel like something out of the 50's. The plot is compelling all the way, and it develops well throughout. This is well-paced, there is not a boring moment to be found. The characters are credible, well-written and deep. Every role is well-cast, and DiCaprio and Winslet(who seems capable of exuding a ton of emotion with as little as a glance of her eyes) are flawless. All of the acting performances are spot-on. This is engaging and impeccably dramatic. You can't help but sympathize with the pair's struggle against conformity. This is not for those who see films as being escapism, as you might expect from anything by Mendes. The editing and cinematography are excellent, and the look of this is not glamorized. There is infrequent strong language, a little sexuality, and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and informative commentary track by Sam and Justin Haythe(who adapted this for the screen), a well-done featurette, and deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director's thoughts on them. I recommend this to everyone mature enough to appreciate it. 8/10",pos
Revolutionary Road,Road to Perdition,10/10/2019,kosmasp,10-十二月-09,"Kate Winslet and Leo reunite after their Titanic ... experience. And while I still have resisted to watch the highest grossing movie ever, I was really anxious to watch this one. A friend of mine had told me, that it was one of the best movies he had watched in 2009. While some movies suffer from high expectations, this one didn't. It's high class drama (if there is such a word/phrase), dark and really ""brutal"" (not in an explicit kind of way).

Acting wise, Kate and Leo really give their best, but they have strong supporting cast to play with. There is one in particular, who also plays the part of comic relief. This is not a comedy (far from it), but those rare moments of comic relief are really needed and thrown in, at the right moments. If you thought, American Beauty was dark and twisted ... you ain't seen nothing yet (until you watch Reservation Road that is)!

Revolutionary Road,Mendes triumphs - A worthy reunion for Kate and Leo,10/8/2019,the-gossip-king,7-十二月-09,"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play April and Frank Wheeler who reunite on screen for the first time in eleven years since the acclaimed blockbuster 'Titanic'. However this time their doom is not a famed ocean liner's decent into the Atlantic but of a marriage descending into the stultifying stillness of suburban life in the 50's. The character are dreamers if you might who don't see their house on Revolutionary Road in Conneticut as a sanctuary but as a prison in which there is no escape. Sam Mendes was the perfect choice as director as the film deals with similar themes to his Oscar winning film 'American Beauty.' His direction is perfect as the audience is never allowed to step back and examine the damage which fate has brought upon the two characters. Instead the camera is constantly on the two leads faces not missing a single reaction that is crucial to the understanding of the motivations of these strange but hauntingly normal characters. There is a possibility that audiences maybe put off by the two characters because they don't play for sympathy, they are too good as actors to do this and their honest performances reflect that because if the actors were to play for sympathy it would be missing the point. Us as an audience live in a day now where free-thinking is widely accepted and acknowledge. Not stifled at first glance and if the actors played for empathy then we would be taken out of their predicament. We as an audience must accept that in another time these two character could have been happy but sadly their fate is doomed in this adaptation of Richard Yates novel - perhaps one of the finest pieces of American literature.",pos
Revolutionary Road,so good i hated it,10/7/2019,jkae89,28-十一月-09,"As contradictory as my title may be, it sums up the following criticism quite well.

As a big fan of both leo and kate (especially their previous project together being a little film called titanic) I had high hopes for this film, and in a way I wasn't disappointed. Although initially hating the movie after I saw it, I came to realize that their performances were so convincing that I, an objective member of the audience, became so emotionally involved in the lives of the two fictional characters on screen before me that their pain became unbearable to endure. I watched as their marriage crumbled more and more rapidly before my eyes not too far into the movie. The flashbacks were effective as they portrayed the ""american dream"" the couple were striving for prior to the horrendous fallout. As the movie progressed, so did my emotional attachment...leading me to the heartbreaking ending. Be warned that this movie is NOT TITANIC! There is NO timeless romance for the ages. There is NO Rose and Jack. There is NO happy ending! You will get great performances accompanied by the great writing and directing. I will NEVER watch this movie again in the remainder of my life! That really is how good it was...",neg
Revolutionary Road,Tragic love story from American Beauty director Sam Mendes.,10/9/2019,axlrhodes,16-十一月-09,"Revolutionary Road is a tragic love story about two people who cant quite find a way to make things work.The film,which is adapted from a novel has so many layers of meaning yet is in its own essence,a very simple and straightforward story.Set against a 1950's backdrop and directed by Sam Mendes,Revolutionary Road is a deeply involving drama which re-unites Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Both stars deliver excellent performances truly bringing fully to life the characters and their contrasting plights. The suburban setting and score by Thomas Newman inevitably remind of Mendes' earlier film American Beauty.A similar kind of tragedy is explored here, as was explored in American Beauty.Mendes seems interested in peoples relationships and the painful dysfunctionality that can arise when two forces aren't pulling in the same direction within the confines of a family unit. Its great material and Mendes delivers a fine film,aided by a committed cast and some great on location camera work and production design.It doesn't indulge comedy like American Beauty but its more than a match in the dramatic stakes. 9/10",pos
Revolutionary Road,Great Acting,10/7/2019,catmmo,8-十一月-09,"This was a story that left me feeling a lot better about my own life compared to these sad and desperate characters. Kate and Leo did a great job in their roles, as did the rest of the cast.

The movie had a feel to it of watching a stage play, and could likely be adapted for the stage very easily. The dialog is the strong suit in this movie by far.

Far from happy, the movie is really quite depressing as you watch the characters never seeming to find any joy and only growing more bitter. I found myself saying several times, ""Wow, their life stinks.""

An odd quirk in the movie is the lack of mentioning where their children are throughout most of it. There was only one part near the end where it's said that the kids are at a friend's house and then it's only more obvious that something is going to happen.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Sharp dialog in a movie about a marriage gone awry,10/9/2019,bandw,5-十一月-09,"It's the 1950s in the United States and Frank and April Wheeler meet, marry, have two kids and purchase a picturesque house in the suburbs. This attractive young couple seems headed for a realization of the America Dream, but they understand too late the compromises that they must accept to get there. Frank is in marketing for Knox Business Machines where he goes every day dressed in a suit and tie, wearing his fedora. Sitting in his cubicle day after day he comes to feel that this is not what he had in mind for his life. Meanwhile, on the home front April is feeling the boredom of the daily routine intensely oppressive. Instead of admitting that maybe life is not going to turn out to be as glamorous as envisioned in some unspecified fantasy, April has the idea that she and Frank can break out of their perceived drab existence by moving to Paris. She convinces Frank of this idea and right then you know that rough times are probably ahead, since neither of them has the ability to think far enough ahead to see what such a move would entail. They have arrived at one of those node points in a relationship that, once a big idea is on the table, and under serious consideration, it's going to be difficult to back off of it or go forward with it, particularly if the idea is not supported equally. Maybe Frank and April's experiment could have been performed, but when the complications of a promotion for Frank and April's pregnancy arise you realize that the marriage is probably doomed.

This is a film where you drop in on some people and get to know them well and see the tragic consequences of their decisions. Frank and April get so deep into their misadventure that they can't right the ship by the time they grasp their situation. There is some keenly observed dialog, like Frank's comment, ""Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control."" The actors are up to the task with the highlight being Michael Shannon playing John Givins, a truth-telling ex-mathematician who is suffering from something like Asperberger's syndrome. His dialog is so trenchant that you have to recoil from it in sympathy with Frank and April. When Givins pointed to April's obvious pregnancy and said, ""I'm glad I'm not going to be that kid,"" I was stunned that someone could dream up such a cutting remark.

The period details like autos, furniture, dress, and street scenes are strikingly well done. While Frank and April's story may have been more common in the 50s, it could easily be translated into a contemporary setting, except for one crucial detail. In contemporary America April could have made a case for a legal second trimester abortion under a doctor's care, based on her mental health. I don't know the intent of the book, but this film makes a case for pro-choice.

There are things to be learned from watching this. If you are on the path to marriage, then it can be a cautionary tale; for all others, it can prompt candid reflection on where you are and where you are going.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Great movie.,10/10/2019,Sirus_the_Virus,23-十月-09,"Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet star as a suburban couple who go through some hard stuff in Revolutionary road. One of last years best films. I liked it more than The Reader. But clearly, the academy didn't really agree.

Di Caprio and Winslet unite as the Wheeler couple. They are an upset couple living in suburbia in the 50's. Soon they decide to take a trip to Paris, but not to visit, to live there. The couple is so miserable that they both end up having affairs.

I am kind of sorry that I spoiled that part. But really it's not that big of a spoiler to be perfectly honest. Director Sam Mendes(American beauty and Away we go) returns with a fantastic film. This is a believable couple. I believe that a couple like them actually existed back then. The movie has many fantastic performances, but the best performance goes to Michael Shannon. He plays a mentally challenged man who insults Leo in one scene and is so good doing it.

Revolutionary road is dramatic and at times sad. You know I expected Leonardo Di Caprio to reunite with Kate Winslet sometime. But I didn't exactly expect this fantastic movie. Revolutionary road deserved more than 3 Oscar nominations because it is just great.

Revolutionary Road,"The ""american nightmare"" : REVOLUTIONARY ROAD",10/9/2019,gilgamesh-1985,1-十月-09,"A dream interrupted abruptly before dawn. Hopes that the long-awaited break in the daily conventionality of a 'life miserable, sleepy, unsatisfied. Ten years on from 'American Beauty', Sam Mendes has again a picture of family and its subsequent disintegration filtered through an apparent normality of the facade, which actually hides concerns and falsehood. Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler are a couple middle-class New York in the Fifties, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an employee, April (Kate Winslet) an aspiring actress. The couple lives with two sons in a comfortable residential dwellings. Their frustrations are as crazy splintered and in fact, at the earliest sequences are seeing anything but edifying skirmishes that follow one another seamlessly. From the novel by Richard Yates 'Revolutionary Road' is an intimate and thorough investigation of the couple's relationship, set in a context, the fifties, so conformist as to be cloying and fake and plastic. Anxieties and fears of a young couple are well masked by a layer of total hypocrisy. The individual aspirations are unattainable goals victims of unavoidable constraints: one can not be what you are. We are allowed to dream, but as long as you keep our feet on the ground. Because in fact this is the crux of the film, where there is division between good and evil, victim and executioner, the only 'guilt' which is attributed to Frank and April is only that he believed it possible to materialize their dreams. For a moment. Endless moment. The American dream does not exist because it never existed, is simply unattainable utopia. Circumvent stereotypes, Sam Mendes enters with skill in the folds of American society, showing a disarming realism and 'objectivity disconcerting: the filmmaker happens to be English, but America knows more of an American himself. And among wild trails, pettiness irrelevant (he who betrays an 'insipid secretary, she is totally indifferent to the news because now no love for him) nothing is what it seems, where even sex is an outlet, a foothold to cling with the aim only to externalize their inner frustrations and drive: eloquent in this case the scene of intercourse in the car. A world where a boy with mental problems (the good Michael Shannon, Oscar nominated) and even the most lucid of all, the only voice out from the pack, but note the fact, fits with sincerity perspective through this sentence: ""It takes the liver to see the void, but It takes a lot more to see that there is hope."" 'Revolutionary Road' is a film slow and introspective, the time taken, in which everything is determined with extreme precision, photography and soundtrack to contribute effectively to the performance of individual sequences, especially the last, shocking and inevitable, in which the emotional tension explodes in a paroxysm becoming almost unbearable. Leonardo DiCaprio is very good, but Kate Winslet is amazing: so real, tangible. Gives the best interpretation of his career identifying himself with monstrous emotion: his every subtle gesture is thus a demonstration of impressive physicality. Commendable. A vision in the original language in this case and for a film focused primarily on the dialogues is almost necessary. 'Revolutionary Road' is a film disillusioned, gloomy, dreary, weary because so truthful and current, the Fifties serve as a perfect disguise of contemporaneity. You can live without dreaming, resigned to a life of mediocrity common and routine, if you do not need to change the city is still dead inside, do not need to have children and raised over then condemned to unhappiness. We Open the eyes then, a new day is looming. And the harsh realities of life to annihilate us.",pos
Revolutionary Road,You don't have to have everything...just something,10/9/2019,pliten,7-九月-09,"Revolutionary Road is the story of a couple in the suburbs of Connecticut. April (Winslet) is an aspiring actress whose dreams had never worked out, and is now a stay-at-home mom and wife. Frank (Dicaprio) is the man of the family, supporting his wife and kids with a job he hardly likes and a life he finds, in his own moments of pure bliss ""hopeless emptiness"". Other characters are also of vital importance in this movie and add so much depth to it. There is John (Michaeal Shannon), a ""supposed"" not-well i.e. mentally insane person who is the son of next-door neighbours Helen& Howard Givings (Bates& Easton). There is also the war-time veteran friend of Frank, whose name I miss, and his wife, which seem, but are not really happy.

SPOILER ALERT!!

Story goes that the main couple had dreams. Frank wanted to see the world and live in Paris, and April wanted to become an actress. Frank wanted to feel emotions, and maybe that is why April married him. April saw in Frank a man who could live out his life the way he wanted, and she could follow suit.

However, things don't turn out well, dream-wise. April and Frank end up having kids, moving to the suburbs an empty life. Emptiness and shallow, and as John puts it so vividly and truthfully in front of them, they should feel sorry for themselves because they had not followed their dreams, like they had promised, though never said, they would. Dreams take hold of them, and they grow apart. Both have affairs, are cold to each other, and say terrible things to each other and make terrible mistakes which they can't get back. Things turn for the worse when April, in a bid to free herself of the life she supposedly hates, performs an abortion on herself. The family falls apart. Frank moves out of the neighbourhood, and is now spending as much time as he can with his kids.

What strikes me in this movie is the realism of the past it portrays. These people are only 50 years or so away from us. They have cars and speak the same language and feel the same emotions, but at times seem distant, as for eg the way women are treated then. Yet at other times, they are so close to home, with the same social problems that couples nowadays have. Affairs. Kids. Emotional upheavals due to work. Neighbours and friends being...just neighbours...and friends, as in putting their own interests in front of yours for the sake of friendship and selfishness. And what happened to us wanting to be big and make a difference in this world? It is all gone? Families are torn apart. Can we be happy? Can we go on?

The answer is simple. Of course we can. Because that is what we do. We live. We die. The cycle goes round and round. We have problems. We deal with them. We think wisely. We educate ourselves. We deal with them. We rationalise, because in my opinion, that is the only way forward. And if we can't achieve our dreams, it is all right. We live by what we have, by the kids we are bringing up, and trying new things and doing things out of the ordinary. Heck, you don't have to go to Paris to live. You just have to live with yourself and the ones you love, and only then they would mean the world to you, and the rest of the world mean nothing. This is I think what the message of the movie is. You try so hard to reach your dreams, and you get confused along the way. You hurt the ones you love, because you think they don't understand. But if you life, then life opens up to you. You become happy, just like Frank did at the end of the movie with his smile, watching his kids of the swing. Though not not extremely happy, or laughing his head of, he was content. I am not saying that is how one should lead one's life. I am just saying that if we are dealt a certain card in life, we should handle it to our best, and in my opinion, that would make us happy.

Brilliant performances by Leo& Kate, and Michael Shannon, and all the other actors& actresses. Leo& Kate give so much depth into their characters that at times, it is very hard to read what they are about to say or do. Honestly, who would have thought April would go on with the abortion at the end of the film? I personally thought: either, she is going to commit suicide, or talk it out with Frank, or live out the rest of her life like that, the ""perfect"" household wife. Her resoluteness during the breakfast scene (perfectly played out) made me wonder whether she'd whoop out the knife the moment Frank pulled out of the driveway.

Music brilliant. In stark contrast to the horrific scene before and after April's abortion. I'm not an expert on decorations, but I believe the 1950s suburbs was nicely shown here.

A brilliant movie to watch& watch again. Good talking points and good education, because that is how we move forward. We educate ourselves on problems we have or might have, so that when situations come, we know how to handle them responsibly. And trust me, those scenes from the film are real. And they happen to everyone of us. If they haven't, just you wait and see.

9/10 for this movie. I felt the smoking scenes were just a bit too obvious here. But that's just my opinion. Again, education.",pos
Revolutionary Road,I'm Glad Someone Woke Up,10/10/2019,Casablanca3784,7-九月-09,"The book, by the same name, was penned in 1961 and it took almost forty years to bring this unbelievably good story to the silver screen? Huh? Well I'm glad that someone woke up so thank you DreamWorks SKG.For heaven's sake; we all know about the enormous talent of Leo DiCaprio but this Kate Winslet lady is totally outta sight. An example? In one year she pulled off ""The Reader"" and ""Rev. Road"" to the amazement of all? Those two movies to many, represent a CAREER but to Kate, all in a day's work. Sorry, but to those who think that Meryl Streep is the best in the business, you're wrong. Kate takes the cake.

""RR"" turns the daily hum drum into bang the drum.An enormously well acted story of a dream turned sour,a devoted spouse & mother turned desperate housewife, marriage vows crushed by either revenge or boredom, the downside of wealth and the final act of ultimate self-pity and misery. ""RR"", a cinematic achievement of unparalleled twists, turns, escapism and the plunge into the abyss of disappointment resulting in tragedy. Rent this DVD, people. It's an amazing film.",pos
Revolutionary Road,About as close to perfect as any film that I have ever seen.,10/9/2019,somf,4-九月-09,"So why do I give it 9 out of ten? Because watching it was not exactly an enjoyable experience and I would not recommend this to everyone. But Sam Mendes may be the best director working in Hollywood today. Each and every performance in this film is nothing short of brilliant. Kate Winslet gives her best performance to date here and I think the same can be said of Leo. Though I continue to admire the hell out of almost everything that he has done. Michael Shannon should have gotten some sort of supporting actor nod. His character of John Givings as sort of the Id personified was probably the most difficult part in the film and he just did an outstanding job. I could go on and on,just don't make me ever see the film again.

Revolutionary Road,Are you going to hit me? To show me how much you love me?,10/8/2019,lastliberal,4-九月-09,"Three Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe for Kate Winslet, who had two superior performances in one year.

The streets are full of machines: men who wear the same white shirts and skinny ties and the same hats, marching to the same mindless jobs.

Ther are so many interesting thoughts and ideas from the past in this film: the patriarchal society, a normal woman doesn't think about abortion, secretaries are for entertainment, electroshock therapy, just to name a few that caused yelling and screaming between Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet).

I took particular note of the ""your father would be so proud"" argument to seal the deal.

Michael Shannon as the son of Helen (Kathy Bates) and Howard (Richard Easton) acts as a mirror that brings out the truth in this dysfunctional relationship, this sham of a marriage that Frank and April have.

I am still reflecting on the ending, but it is the only way it could have happened.

Great performances by all, especially Winslet.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Grim and potent look at a failing marriage.,10/8/2019,Spikeopath,23-八月-09,"It's the mid 1950s and Frank and April Wheeler are not so much facing the seven year itch in their marriage, but more an opening wound from which forms a chasm of despair that is luring them in.

Revolutionary Road is a tough sell as a piece of entertainment, in fact it's probably best to sell it as a tough uncompromising expose of a drifting suburbanite relationship. Adapting from Richard Yate's misery laden ""classic,"" director Sam Mendes and his team have crafted an actors piece that is as rewarding as it most definitely is a downer. Full of deceit and sadness, it's only really with the complexities of the characters that the discerning viewer can be pulled in to the perspectives of the protagonists. That this occurs is testament to the acting ability of both Kate Winslet {April} and Leonardo DiCaprio {Frank}. Arguably two of the best actors of their generation, they each give it such believability, such desperation, it offers up an anti-dote to any effects driven picture rising up the current DVD sales charts.

Clinically directed by Mendes, and given a lush 50s sheen from Roger Deakins visuals, Revolutionary Road is a must see of modern era, dramatic, dialogue driven films. If one is likely to want to see it again after viewing it is questionable. The DVD sales will make for interesting reading I feel. But once viewed it's unlikely that you are ever likely to forget having let the piece get under your skin. Something I think that this film will achieve to the majority of like minded adults after some like minded adult cinema. 8/10",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Honey, I'm home!",10/9/2019,gregoirio,21-八月-09,"It opens at a party, where the two main characters meet each other. Then it flash forwards to a play, where Winslets character just performed an awful acting performance, and the two main characters lash out on the side of the road on the way home. Then the title rolls. And after a while, you think that there isn't a better scene than that. But soon it happens. The movie is about a plan to put a marriage back together, but after an unplanned pregnancy, a few affairs, an new high paying job for the husband. And then comes the scene, after a long roller coaster ride of drama and high hopes, where a man who is virtually mentally ill exposes the perfect couple as seen in public for what they truly are. DiCaprio can't handle it, yells at him for feeling insecure for being exposed. The man tells Winslets character he feels bad for her but at the same time, thinks she is awful as well, for putting up with everything and how she let her become a ruined human. He leaves, saying he feels sorry for himself, but says that there is one person in the room he wouldn't want to be: the unborn child. After he leaves, the eruption starts, and the fight escalates into the woods. It's the perfectly acted scene of this half of the decade so far. And what happens after is just unbearably unbelievable and at the same time, irritably true to life. Revolutionary Road will not necessarily corrupt or destroy your view on the perfect 50's life, but instead it will make you realize what a lie that lifestyle is, and help you realize why we are here now. Winslet and DiCaprio are not only at the top of their game, but at the top of the entire game (that's every actor in the world, thank you). They stick with you and eat you alive. Don't expect any comfort.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Well performed downer! Insightful...........?,10/7/2019,bobm5508,21-八月-09,"This movie has elicited many ""10s"" and lots of ""2s"" from our trusty IMDb readers. That is always interesting to me. A performance is called ""bad community theater"" stuff by one viewer, others hail the movie's performances as ""great"".

I'm guessing that the depressing nature of watching a suburban couple bemoan their seemingly OK life, and the internal strife of that conflict, is insightful for most, painful for some and irritating for a few.

I generally watch movies to be enlightened, entertained or educated. I'd be hard pressed to say this movie did any of those. But, I was enthralled by the performances, which I considered to be as good as they get. A scene of the corporate ""clones"" departing the 'burbs for their corporate jobs was sensationally filmed, stunning in is scope and set the tone for the ""robotic"" view of suburban life the author/director chose to hang their story on. But this point of view is not enlightening. Kate and Leo, as the struggling suburban couple, argue with the intent to injure, but after reflection, seem to still have the core of affection that originally brought them together. They fight hard, re-group, create a plan to break away and then deteriorate again as the plan slips away.

It's not much of a plan. Quit their present life and head to Paris. She'll work, he'll find himself! Other than they are not the ""special"" people Kate envisioned they would be, there isn't much to escape from. Is Leo droning out a living? Sure, who didn't! It was post-war USA. But then he's offered a promotion that seems a bit exciting to him, so maybe things are looking up. Kate can't even verbalize what makes them ""special"" and why they should escape their ""trapped"" life, other than they just should.

I felt the movies' ""big cheat"", was the role of Kathy Bates' son. An accomplished mathematician, he is deemed different, institutionalized and apparently brutalized. He has had 64 shock treatments for a condition that doesn't appear to warrant such drastic treatment. But, that's life in the 50's. Offbeat is insane. But, he is presented as the person with the real insight! Is it the author's point that 64 shock treatments help see life more clearly. The character gives us the key insightful line in the movie when he proclaims that many admit to the emptiness of suburban life, but that ""it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" In his only other scene he makes a proclamation to Kate that seals the movie's final fate. Perhaps his unfiltered take on life makes the character viable, but I thought it was too extreme, too convenient. And the use of ex-marital activity by both was intriguing. In both cases it was to feel something, anything!

But, I'm babbling. The movie was a well performed downer. We watch a painful slice of life. In fact, if you get the DVD make sure to watch the deleted scenes. The director may have left an Academy Award nomination for DeCaprio on the cutting floor. He has two incredible (i.e. -- not ""community player"") scenes that were left out.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Our dreams may come true?maybe not in this life...,10/8/2019,Exxon_1985,20-八月-09,"1950s and a class of life combined in routine way and regrets of a young lucky couple,main idea seems not bad, though you know , i feel a lot that the main performance of this book is good for theater.not just because of a little unreality of environment in the movie,but because the chemistry of the couple gets more hot and deep while their problems appear. they don't think that they deserve such a normal and empty life,even with two kids and a house big enough for the family in Revolutionary Road.American dreamz(s) are in vain. being in their place gives me a doubt of paranoid.promoting a normal life in ones own situation or praising dreams by joining Paris because everything seems something else in there. i believe for a lot of couples in real life,not certainly in 50s,but right now this problem is shining.man of family feels that wife and kids is not what he is after in his dreams.doing ordinary job does not satisfy him and wife is not happy for being mama for kids and housewife everyday.even after testing other thing and failing all over again... maybe couples like Frank Wheeler and April Wheeler should accept life and married life is just that.you don't fly to the moon or climb mount Everest with married life.but for these two people their last hope is to immigrate to Paris and when Frank is offered for promotion and April is pregnant for third time,their dream is about to terminate and their life is about to end...

Sam Mendes is sort of Douglas Sirk director of our age with Amercan Buieaty and Revolutionary Road.a little absence of real feeling and unreal scenes are among this picture and Kate Winslet,my god she has the Right to win Golden Globe award for this movie,for being a smoking upset mama which she is not in love with his husband anymore but she is the mother of his 2 children.Kate is an actress at last,not that nude b**ch in Holly Smoke,Jude or Little Children.

Leonardo DiCaprio is well as Frank.a regular man who is thirsty of promotion and wants his life as dreamy as it gets.sleeps with another woman but like his wife to keep their third kid.he is a man of life and man of his own together.this movie shouts this sentence:American Drwams Riuned forever...",pos
Revolutionary Road,What Lies Beneath,10/8/2019,kenjha,2-八月-09,"In 1950s Connecticut, a seemingly happy young couple copes with personal problems. It's a beautifully realized film based on a 1961 novel by Richard Yates, although the screenplay is somewhat choppy. Mendes does an excellent job of evoking a period where life seemed to be simpler, but, as always, there were people who had to fight personal demons. Winslet and DiCaprio are terrific as the volatile couple, with the former seeking escape from her mundane existence while making life hell for the latter. Standouts in the supporting cast are Bates as a real estate agent and Shannon, funny and scary, as her mentally disturbed son. Newman provides a rather haunting score.

Revolutionary Road,"The quintessential ""trapped in the 1950s"" story",10/9/2019,brian_r_wright,30-七月-09,"Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) meet cute as highly charged young adults in the big city. It's love at first sight, and the director and actors do a fine job of making Frank and April the perfect couple... not only to fall in love, but to have a chance to break out of the straight jacket(s) of the era. Game on. And most of us are cheered with hope for them: she's an aspiring actress and he utters the lines above, i.e. ""I want to feel things, really feel them.""

From the gitgo, you have a feeling they're different, that they may actually conquer the ubiquitous conformity of their Man in the Gray Flannel Suit times.

Revolutionary Road,Fear & Bravery,10/9/2019,sunznc,18-七月-09,"One of the characters in the film says, ""a man gets maybe 2 chances where a good opportunity is presented to him and he better take it by the balls when he can or he might find himself sitting in a place he doesn't want to be and wondering how he got there."" Maybe that isn't exactly how it is phrased but it's close and it's the message of the film.

If you really, really want to change your life you must have courage and be very brave. A lot of us are very comfortable and familiar with our lives and comfortable with the familiarity.

If this seems like a lot to take in then you might want to avoid this film. The couple in the film struggle with their own desires and dreams for themselves and for their relationship. When an opportunity comes up to move to Europe it invigorates them and makes them feel alive! Yet, when things don't quite work out as planned they have problems.

Very good acting, very good sets and costumes.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A very moving movie with great answers!,10/8/2019,bharath-karthikeyan,2-七月-09,"Revolutionary Road comes as a period film set during the times when computers needed sales executives to sell them! The first credit should go to the stellar acting performance of both Leonardo and Kate Winslet.They have done a terrific job that no point of time you get to realize that its just a drama. The movie is about a young couple's dreams of having a extravagant life which takes a flight to neverland after their marriage and hence they find themselves as a normal generic couple with two kids. But April(Kate) still does not want to quit trying and proposes for a new life in Paris for the family.Can Frank(Leonardo) give into this new wild plan with an existing steady job and promotion in hand and also April pregnant with their third child,is all the movie's is about. The Soundtrack by Thomas Newman is brilliant and casts its spell throughout. Some things are better unsaid,and this is what the movie is all about,the Wheelers wont be forgotten!

Revolutionary Road,"Thought provoking, haunting, uncomfortable mirror - in other words AWESOME!",10/10/2019,basement_critic,8-六月-09,"Praising individual performances seems such a trivial tribute to this masterpiece... but boy do they deserve praise! I did not bat one disinterested eyelid while watching this dark insight into 1950's East coast suburbia. The quintessential American dream - an adorable young couple, a house on a manicured lawn, kids playing, summer trappings, friendly neighbors - in stark contrast to the debilitating internal conflict and crumbling foundation of the focal social construct - the married life of Frank and April. Sounds clichéd but so is breathing and eating. How did we get here? Start with a layer of sweet-talking, charm and maybe physical chemistry, knead that into a wedding cake mix, pile on top of that foolishly optimistic unfulfilled personal dreams, cover with social pressures, appearances and innocent children's futures and top off with self-inflicted guilt brought on by impulsive behaviors. Sprinkle the need for caring and being cared all over that concoction and add a dash of desire to feel important. That is surefire recipe for disaster even on its own, but when a mentally 'unstable' John Givings (Michael Shannon) projects piercingly true insight into what issues are really at play versus what the protagonists fool themselves into believing, it is accelerated into a hopelessly fast and explosive meltdown. I am inclined to wonder though, if the setting of this movie was 2009, would things have turned out differently. This movie will haunt me for days to come. Bits and pieces are certainly lodged permanently in the psyche.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A little revolutionary,10/7/2019,tastyhotdogs,7-六月-09,"""Revolutionary Road"" reunites ""Titanic"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in a story about a couple who become unhappy with where their life is and decide to set off for Paris. Leo plays Frank, a business man who is becoming increasingly bored with his life and has realised he's not where he wants to be. Winslet plays April, a stay-at-home mum who still yearns to become a great actress (her character, not Kate Winslet) but realises that part of her life has probably passed her by. One night April confronts Frank that they should up and move to Paris, a place Frank loves and that may enable him to chase his true dreams. At first Frank comes up with all the negatives, but soon realises ""why not!"". They start making plans but things get railroaded when April gets pregnant and Frank gets offered a way better job with a lot more money. Will they still chase their dreams, or will their responsibilities keep them home? Something different, as the movie leaves it to you for the most part to decide whether life is about chasing our dreams, fulfilling our responsibilities...or a bit of both. Well acted and a good story, but it got a bit too silly for my liking in the last 30mins. Worth a look.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Toto, we're not on the Titanic anymore",10/8/2019,purrlgurrl,6-六月-09,"In Titanic, Kate and Leo were the achingly romantic, star-crossed lovers who would meet again in eternity. In Revolutionary Road they show us what might have happened if the couple survived.

It's late 1950s American suburbia and he's settled into a similar deadening job in sales, at the same company, as his father and she's an unhappy, stifled housewife who once dreamed of being an actress. Along the way, both have meaningless affairs to relieve their boredom. Attempting to save their marriage, she devices a desperate plan to escape their narrow, regimented 50s existence -- they'll sell everything, take their life savings and move the family (they have two kids) to Paris, where he can take time off to ""find himself"" while she works as a secretary at NATO or UNESCO to support them.

This dream is shattered by her unplanned pregnancy (termination is not an option for him) and his recent promotion at work. What happens then is the unraveling of a marriage and a life.

This is not a movie for faint of heart. It's long, very slow-paced (a BBC production) and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for this pair. This is a far different couple from the lovers in Titanic. And, thank God for that because in this film both actors get the chance to demonstrate the true range of their talents, as well as again, the powerful chemistry they have together on screen.

There are uniformly fine performances by the supporting cast, with Michael Shannon the standout (and Oscar nominee) as the emotionally disturbed son of friends, whose insanity grants him the freedom to be the sole voice of truth in this repressed suburban hell.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Winslet & DiCaprio,10/9/2019,jkysharma,6-六月-09,"Sam Mendes' latest offering is, at long last, an adaptation of Richard Yates' book of the same name. I've heard a lot about his book (haven't read it) and would have thought that it merited a scramble for the production rights. Having seen the movie, I can't wait to read it. At a time when there seems to be a paucity for good scripts in Hollywood, a film about personal struggles and showcasing the monotony of daily life is a rarity. This has to be right up there with the best of the films on the 'American Dream', shown in its stagnation nevertheless. Reading up on the praise showered by contemporaries and critics alike on Yates' book, the magnitude of the task dawned upon me and anyone will acknowledge that it takes a team like this to do justice to the source material. It does, with some members of the cast walking away with the laurels, none more so than Kate Winslet.

To say that she stands at the apex of her profession, unchallenged, would not be stating too much. Her April Wheeler is passionate, constantly challenging the fabric of stillness that overhangs the setting and the one person in the film who harbors the founding thought of the United States – hope. Watching her during the silent moments of the film is an exercise in getting floored repeatedly. In an inspired piece of casting, Leonardo DiCaprio plays April's man Frank. Representative of men from a time when everybody craved a security blanket, here is an actor at the top of his craft and still getting better.

This film also completes a circle of sorts for the two. In the interim between Titanic (1997) and Revolutionary Road (2008), their careers have been fulfilling for the actors and fans alike. Together here, they make for immensely compelling viewing.

Michael Shannon as John Givings is the surprise package of the film and I couldn't help thinking of 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest', another quintessentially American film. In the sense that, if he's crazy, it's only because they say so. Also, it probably takes an out-of-the-box thinker to comprehend April and Frank's plans. Another performance worth treasuring for it doesn't get much of screen time.

Mendes brings his gift for ushering a sense of balance to proceedings and making it look natural. This may not turn out to be as memorable for him as American Beauty but the movie is all the better for it. Thomas Newman's score, the costumes by Albert Wolsky and the art direction by Debra Schutt and Kristi Zea add considerably to the film.

This one kept me awake for a while after the credits had rolled. This particular representation of the American Dream may not be relevant any more but the themes of conformity, loneliness and frustration hold true.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road... You say you want a revolution?,10/9/2019,juliankennedy23,5-六月-09,"Revolutionary Road: 9 out of 10: The strangest complaint about this movie is that it is painful to watch and too realistic. For example one critic exclaims “It's unbecoming -- and it should be worked out in private, not in a movie theater."" another claims.“This is a movie about two people in pain; the last thing they need is for Mendes to turn his cool camera on them."" This is a serious depiction the disintegration of a marriage. Why should we be expecting musical numbers? Are we so used to “everything will work out” American movies with big name stars that we now demand successful conclusions? If you have, you ever sat through a Holocaust film or a movie involving a dog named Yeller you know the eternal truth .This is not going to end well. Kate Winslet gives an outstanding performance; this should surprise no one. (The fact she actually keeps her top on, for once, may raise a few eyebrows however among a disappointed throng.) Leonardo DiCaprio’s performance is her equal in every way; and there is no denying in those 15 odd years after Titanic that these two stars have even more chemistry than before. The rest of the cast is also beyond top notch with Kathy Bates as a venomous realtor, a particular stand out. Sam Mendes’ direction also shines. He keeps the camera pointed at both the actors and seemingly their characters souls. In addition nobody uses focus and character placement better than Mendes. Each frame seems its own work of art The plot is simple. Winslet and DiCapiro are married with two kids. He works in a dead end job in Manhattan, while she takes care of the kids and lives in quiet desperation in suburbia. If there is a problem with the set-up, it is that women in the audience may be noticeably envious of Winslet’s lifestyle while the men may hanker for a do nothing, three martinis, fling with the secretary, job. Life in the fifties, at least for the white, upper middle class, does not seem very bad on the surface. That said the yearning and the subsequent disastrous consequences seem all too true. Winslet and DiCapiro fight like real couples do. Starting small and quickly hitting at each other’s hot buttons. Winslet has the emotion heft in the arguments, and comes across as the stronger person; wounded by life. DiCapiro, ironically, only has the fact he is right to keep him afloat. (Moving to Paris would solve nothing, he is as trapped as she is, and neither of them is special.) I do have a couple of nitpicks with Revolutionary Road. The conveniently disappearing children are a problem. Director Mendes trots them out for a few scenes in the middle of the film but honestly, they are never underfoot, and as real children is when marriages disintegrate. In addition, that fact that Winslet’s Stepford wife routine does not raise DiCaprio’s eyebrows towards the end of the film raised my eyebrows. He seemed a little more clued enduring the proceeding to let that pass by unnoticed. I did recognize the arguments that couples have, as well as the quandary of following your dreams rather than being happy with whom you are. (Following your bliss can lead to much misery in real life; both for yourself and those that love you.) Then again, we have only one life, so how should we spend it. I do not see this argument between flights of fantasy and a practical life being solved anytime soon. However, as short as our time on Earth is, I cannot help but recommend spending two hours of it in the company of Winslet and DiCapiro. Revolutionary Road is simply one of the best films of 2008.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A remarkable film- not for the faint-hearted,10/8/2019,rmanory,27-五月-09,"I read many comments I agreed with here. This film is shocking. On one hand it is very well played and directed, on the other hand...I wouldn't recommend it to my friends because it is too disturbing. Perhaps this is what movie are supposed to have, catharsis, but...on the other hand...reality bites too hard here. April and Frank live in an idyllic American suburb, in house set among trees, they have two kids. All is nice, neighbors adore them, even (Kathy Bates) the Realtor who showed them the house loved them...These are the appearances. Frank (Di Caprio) hates his job, but accepts it as a given and when April (Winslet) suggests that he should quit he is willing to take her advice.. go to Europe into the unknown. He was really going to do it, quit and go, until...opportunity intervened...for a job with more responsibility and more money...and perhaps less boredom. This was an ego trip for Frank. And yet --in a situation that is upside down from what anyone would expect-- April is unhappy, and this unhappiness is so entrenched that it will finally lead to disaster and turn a career turn into a family disaster. Sam Mendes has done it again. After brilliantly depicting the hell of family life in an idyllic suburb in 'American Beauty,' he managed to reinvent himself in Revolutionary Road. He was helped by his extraordinary cast and by a good script, but still... Winslet is very good in depicting April's step-by-step descent into madness, and she definitely deserved the Golden Globe, and perhaps even the Oscar (but wasn't nominated for this movie). Actually it is hard to judge who is the better actor between her and DiCaprio, but I guess hers is a more difficult role because of her frequent mood changes. A great film, NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Beautiful,10/8/2019,tlove21,26-五月-09,"I think this show captures all the essence of a troubled marriage... Usually a stable man has am unstable woman or a stable woman has a man that has no balls in this case they were both the persons a stable person should not have..

You will understand why I said that..

The acting was heart felt and I could feel the pain the happiness the frustration everything was juiced into making this experience memorable.. give it a watch If at the end of this movie you don't feel like you know these people. Watch it again.. Truly awesome acting, really nice storyline..

Revolutionary Road,Perfectly directed and acted...,10/8/2019,Siamois,20-五月-09,"With Revolutionary Road, the excellent Sam Mendes delivers his most powerful and gripping movie since his debut, American Beauty. Coincidentally or not, both of these dramas hit similar themes and their protagonists also share a lot in common.

Suburban couples whom, on the surface, are seemingly perfect but in in reality are growing apart, trying to define or redefine their existence, having doubts about their lifestyles? This summary can be applied to both films and yet, it would be a terribly inaccurate injustice to say this film is ""just like American Beauty"".

The story is definitely its own, so are the characters. Mendes' direction also really sticks to the movie rather than being formulaic. He is better than ever, ever image, every moment, every emotion perfectly captured. DiCaprio and Winslet? They nail their parts as a couple, the Wheelers. It's just perfect, nuanced, authentic.

With all these people on top of their game and an interesting premise, Revolutionary Road could have easily been a 9, perhaps even a 10. Alas, the screenplay has significant flaws. For one, a few lines are weak. Nothing major but still. More importantly, there seems to be something missing. The whole pointlessness of their existence not made so clear, for instance. And then, there's the Wheelers' children.

Yes, our suburb couple has children but where are they, exactly? Not really in this movie, unfortunately. I realize that with a director like Mendes, few things were probably left to chance and this was probably a deliberate, conscious decision. Perhaps as early as the screenplay, or maybe in the editing room? Whatever the case maybe, it's a weak point and prevents the movie from having the punch to become a TRUE, long-lasting American classic. I'm talking top 100 movie of all times. Had this movie been extended by 15 minutes or so (which would be entirely reasonable given it's actual running time) I think much could have been explained and the final third of the movie, as well as its resolution, would have had even more impact.

We're still left with powerful characters and another movie that is fodder for us viewers, about the apparent inescapable cogs of the wheel of our lives.

Do we really need to live in such standard ways? And more importantly, if we do, is it instantly wrong? As usual for Mendes, he explores those black and white questions and shows you the wide palette of gray between these two extremes.

Kudos to Mendes, our two leads, as well as the supporting cast and Mendes technical team. The weakness of this movie is Justin Haythe, whose sole other screen writing credit is the laughably bad ""The Clearing"". There just aren't that many Alan Ball around to write perfect stories.",neg
Revolutionary Road,A strong marriage tragedy with some minor flaws,10/8/2019,michaeleicht,17-四月-09,"This is the first review I write here - that doesn't have to mean it's going to be a bad one. The thing I'll try here is to show what I would've done differently if I had been the director. Intrigued - then read on! The strong things: the camera department has made a good show - along with some OK music it makes the film very moody overall. That's one good thing. Then, the performances are mostly quite strong - but there are a few exceptions, I will cover later. The dialogues are mostly believable and the script holds enough changes to keep us intrigued.

Here is what I would have made differently: 1) I would have changed some actors. The girl Frank has an affair with, is simply much less attractive than his beautiful wife, for most men, so that is not believable at all. She wasn't such a special character, too.

2) Another acting thing: the woman of the other marriage coupled played beyond bad. So: either changing the actress or trying one's best to get a passable performance.

3) I would have changed one line: that ""Leo"" didn't know ""Kate"" wasn't in Paris. When you are married, you should know about such a thing, so that is NOT realistic.

4) There was a scene where the charismatic ""crazy"" man was completely blurred despite talking. Could have been a tried way to do sth. original, but what is original isn't necessarily good. That's the only weak thing about the cinematography, though.

5) Some non-linear time changes, e. g. going back, or foreshadowing would have made the film even more interesting. I probably would have changed the script here a bit, but it is okay how it is.

6) In my mind there is another thing I don't remember. If I saw it a second time, there would maybe be more thing I notice that would be better off changed. Oh, maybe that there weren't enough close ups in such an intense, ""closed"" kind of drama, but it was another thing I tried to remember.

Overall, a fine film with some flaws that aren't quite tragic enough to leave me feel the film I just saw was mediocre. It HAS the typical Mendes-feel, although he hasn't quite made a lot films yet. Looking forward to seeing more, though.

This is an 8.4 for me, so not nine, but really a bit better than the average eight. Can I recommend this movie? Yes, a lot.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Rebirth can only come through suffering,10/10/2019,Dr_Coulardeau,14-四月-09,"This film could have been a melodramatic mash and it is not. In fact the situation and the various developments make it quasi-tragic. Tragic because it is the story of a totally impossible epiphany for a couple who is living in our modern society. There is no escape from the present programmed and even pre-fabricated life in which we all live. We have practically no freedom of choice. The only freedom of choice we do have is to refuse a possible promotion, a potential chance in this life, and we will end up on the dump, the manure pile. There is no choice because we have to pay for the house, the car, the children's education, and so many other things. There is no real choice because our psyches have been pre-determined into accepting the small little tiny wee box that has been attributed to our life. Our psyche is always opportunistic and it always goes the way the wind blows. Even a simple accident, like an unwanted pregnancy, the result of a negligence as for preventive protection, the result of going out bareback when it is well known we are supposed to go out covered, if we want to really have a choice, becomes the direst tragedy of all times. But we are in such a formatted life that we forget something because ""they"", the big brothers of this brave new world, have mesmerized us into forgetting. There is no simple way out, there is no way out at all. Any attempt at trying to evade the consequences of this event will lead to an even worse catastrophe, like death, or suicide, or death by suicide or suicide by death. Tragic indeed. I will also add that the main two actors are outrageously outstanding. They play their anger, their disorientation, their psychoses, their schizophrenias even with such realism and conviction that we may think they are playing their own roles, their own parts, their own private fate and destiny. It is true the cameraman is also quite prodigious. The way he takes the profile of Di Caprio when this one is supposed to be stubbornly refusing any move brings out this stubborn-ness revealed by the very line of the forehead seen under that profile angle, a Neanderthal or apish profile indeed. It is such details that make an actor and a film remarkable. It is true too that the insane, deranged son of the real estate agent is truer than nature, more prophetic about this society than all the Bibles of the world, than all the Freuds and Marxes of this low, low world of ours.

Revolutionary Road,A Nutshell Review: Revolutionary Road,10/7/2019,DICK STEEL,6-四月-09,"It's been some twelve years since James Cameron's Titanic sealed Leonardo DiCaprio's heartthrob status, and everyone's been wondering when DiCaprio and his co-star Kate Winslet would once again grace the screen together with that kind of on screen chemistry and magic that made thousands relive that cross-Atlantic adventure tragedy over and over again, effectively retiring James Cameron (until this year of course with his 3D film Avatar) since the film powered past a billion dollars in box office receipts.

With tongue in cheek, I thought this Sam Mendes movie offered audiences a peek into how Jack Dawson and Rose's lives would have been, should they live through that night to remember together, and settle down in the USA. The free-spirited Dawson would find his life now quite the bore as compared to his free-wheeling days of a drifter, now rooted to a nine to five job he doesn't believe in, and lives his life like a robot only to pay the bills. As for Rose, she being stuck at home as a housewife also doesn't seem like the life she thought she signed on for, with the realities of matrimony settling in to demolish notions of a once daring romance.

Leonardo DiCaprio reunites with Kate Winslet (and Kathy Bates too!) in Revolutionary Road, that on the surface looks at how the familiar has crept into the lives of a married couple, and beneath the veneer and belief of their neighbours, theirs is a union slowly disintegrating, not that they do not try, but probably tried too hard, and where indifference start to rear its ugly head to destroy passion and love. We see how both do things that will ultimately hurt and betray the sliver of trust that's left, and how each manipulates the other in subtle ways in order to get what they think they want.

The bulk of the film was centred around their joint decision to uproot their family (and the children whom we rarely see) and move to Paris, so that DiCaprio's Frank would be able to live out his dream, of finding out his true calling. This would mean selling all their assets, crossing the steamship the other way round (which I chuckled at, and wonder if we're really going to see that at all), and having his wife support him (because the Europeans pay secretaries exorbitant salaries) while he mucks around for inspiration to life. This would also mean bidding Sayonara to his dead end job, until Murphy so decides to throw a spanner in the works with Frank gaining much needed recognition.

Kate Winslet's April seemed to be the all-sacrificing wife, until her frequent breakdowns seem to cast doubts on her sanity, having to fight like mad with her husband, only to put on a more cordial front every morning at breakfast. One can only guess that she's doing her best to keep things from breaking down, but there's only a limit to how many holes you can plug with your fingers. In fact, the film develops at a pace with which paint dries, and comes alive only when Frank and April trade verbal blows, with hurting insults flying both directions with the threat of physical violence always close by.

It's about the hypocrisy that we are aware of, yet choose to play the social charade and getting a kick out of laughing at the fakeness of it all behind closed doors, behind other people's backs. The games we play with the intention to hurt will sometimes backfire on ourselves too, and it's almost always never a good thing to be doing something to hit back at the other person, one whom you know you love. But rectifying it head on also means that it's time to give it up, but preferably done so in a more civil manner compared to dropping the bombshell and hoping for an expected reaction.

Perhaps in the madness of it all, it takes an ex-mental patient character John (played by Michael Shannon) to become the voice of reason in an insanely fake world that both Frank and April find themselves in. In being crazy, he's granted the excuse to cut through the nonsense and say things as he sees fit, and has some of the best lines in the movie but also being the most accurate in the reading of the characters' expressions. If you think both Frank and April have words that hurt, pay attention to the wise sayings of John.

Based on a novel by Richard Yates, Sam Mandes managed to bring out the best in the chemistry between his two leading stars. Between them, age has not been kind to Winslet, while the additional lines on DiCaprio's face makes him all the more mature, though retaining his baby-faced looks that even made it to the insults their character trades.

Just when everything starts to meander around the themes it set out to explore, and treading in dangerous ground in being too convoluted for its own good, the parting shot was quite verbose in summing everything up quite nicely, in that it pays to switch off at times, or most of the times if you will, in order to keep things as status quo without the opportunity of being misread that you're uncooperative, or unwilling to lend a listening ear. Very poignant, and chillingly real.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Totally enthralling and painfully realistic drama,10/9/2019,Andy-Denotti,24-三月-09,"This drama is so well made and both Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet are so exceptionally good in their dramatic interpretation that I often forgot I was watching a movie. Leonardo di Caprio really excels and you cannot avoid empathizing with his character.

The director of American beauty does another brilliant job at depicting the frustration of leading an ordinary existence and the devastating consequences that a desperate need to find a way out might lead to. This time though with an emphasis on drama and tragedy; there is no comic relief here to help you hide from the pain. Revolutionary road is a movie that explores the inner struggle of trying to reconcile the dream of doing something extraordinary with our lives with the perspective of inevitably conforming to what everyone else does. In the second part of the story all the way to the ending an ominous thriller-type atmosphere bleeds into the drama and by then you are totally enveloped in the character's lives, anxiously waiting to find out how they will end up.

This part might contain spoilers:

After the inebriation of finding each other, getting married and having children, husband and wife find themselves becoming the ordinary people they had promised themselves never to become. Leonardo di Caprio's character is an intelligent and imaginative man who has a job he hates and Kate Winslet's character is an actress turned housewife, suffocating at the idea that their dreams may have been lost forever in their middle class existence. In an attempt to escape the hopeless emptiness they feel closing in on them, she suggests a drastic change. They decide to throw caution to the wind and take off to start a new life in Paris, where people ""really live"".

Revolutionary Road,An eye-opening road,10/9/2019,liyinalways,18-三月-09,"Let me start by complimenting Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on their brilliant performance in this movie. In my opinion, Leonardo deserves a commanding nomination for some awards too following his role in this film. They made their roles come alive which made their stories very believable. Michael Shannon who played John Givings in the movie did a good job too.

This movie shows a couple (the Wheelers) that decides to do something which most of us know is an option we commonly ignore at the back of our mind. They opt to escape from the constant predicament of what everyday life has to offer- the jobs, the people we associate with, the house, the surroundings. So, almost all of us can easily relate to this story as having thought about how constant life can get at one point or another.

The movie shows us how Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) deals with the ups-and-downs of what life throws at them. All these prove to challenge their relationship even more so. This is what ultimate reality is where love is being tested whether it could stand the test of time.

I rated this movie a 9.0 for the brilliant acting by the two main characters and also for the true significance of this film.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Disconcertingly mirrors its subject matter - attempts to be different, but ends up disappointingly the same",10/8/2019,pyrocitor,20-二月-09,"Familiarity need not always be a bad thing. The concept of film genres would be essentially void without a cultural recognition of visual and narrative patterns trends establishing a sect of films. Moreover, many cinematic works incorporate the notion of cultural baggage, using familiarity with previously established conventions to add emphasis to or to subvert contemporary efforts. However, the notion of baggage can also work towards an opposite effect, making narrative material which may have once appeared fresh come across as repetitive and unoriginal, devaluing an otherwise quality film. This proves to be exactly the case with Sam Mendes' adaptation of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road. Attacking the film's formidable quality would be senseless, yet the consistent sense of unoriginality ensures the film never quite attains its desired effect, despite it being a stunningly powerful attempt.

Yet perhaps this concern with familiarity should hardly come as a surprise, as the concept had encircled Revolutionary Road right from the casting of its two leads. Despite the promised subversion of the timeless love story offered in Titanic, the film's marketing and hype banked very much on the reuniting of co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and the hope that the chemistry and spark between them would go on as much as their hearts once did, leading to a potential case of cultural expectations overshadowing the effort in question. The same goes for American Beauty director Mendes once again digging up a dark undercurrent to supposedly sublime suburban life. Such a combination of factors makes the fact that Revolutionary Road is such an excellent film in itself feel almost like a shallow construction of a success, as the film appeared so tailor made to be nothing less that its own quality appears to paradoxically seem unsatisfactory.

Nevertheless, the familiarity of the film extends beyond its cast and crew, as the subject matter derived from Yates' novel manages to do what it does exceedingly well while somehow managing to find nothing new to offer that countless other depictions of 1950s married life had not already unearthed. This adherence to convention becomes difficult to navigate - on one hand, Mendes might be seen as making a critical comment on the desired homogeneity of the time through ironically making use of 1950s stereotypes and familiar narrative arcs. Yet at the same time, the film exudes a continual sense of award baiting self- importance, an implied attempt to elevate it to the level of 'high drama', from the neatly pristine period exteriors and pastel coloured costumes to Thomas Newman's wistful, tinkling piano score which appears to be directly plundered from his previous work with Mendes on American Beauty. The continual sense of the 'serious, important film' Revolutionary Road seemingly set out to be, in turn makes it feel less serious and important.

However, such a wave of criticisms need not overshadow what is fundamentally still an incredibly powerful, moving and classy piece of work. Mendes' directorial capabilities have lost none of their stunning emotional clout, and he demonstrates a disconcerting skill to casually manipulate audience emotions. Whether provoking cries of frustration towards the annoyingly chirpy neighbours and their inability to come to terms with the Wheelers' plan to break out of suburban conformity and begin new, more fulfilling lives in Paris, or the crushing emotional anguish at the notion that such a beacon of hope may not end up becoming a reality, do not expect to shake the flooring aftertaste of the film for quite some time. Similarly, master cinematographer Roger Deakins' use of tight framing within close interiors creates an exquisitely subtle yet unbearably uncomfortable sense of claustrophobia, perfectly coupling the barely perceivable silent emotional scream of repression pervading the film. Finally, the film's unexpectedly unorthodox yet somehow fitting final shot is so mischievously welcome that it just about merits seeing the whole film in itself.

Despite the hype, the genuinely masterful performances generated by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cannot be ignored, their shining chemistry both during romantic interludes and hysterical screaming fits creating a supremely affecting piece of interpersonal drama. Few sights are so disillusioning as seeing the enthusiastic, hopeful spark in the eyes of DiCaprio at the film's opening being replaced by a flinty, critical stare painfully shortly afterwards, encapsulating the impish youngster being swallowed up through a desire to fit in with the environment surrounding him. Similarly, Winslet's eyes denote a harrowing sadness which similarly becomes increasingly deadened, to the point of the viewer being hard pressed to avoid tears themselves, conventional narrative or not. The tremendous performances of the lead duo are well supported by the efforts of Kathy Bates, gleefully irritating yet crucially heart wrenching in turn as the Wheelers' chirpy neighbour. The explosive Michael Shannon barely holds back from chewing the scenery as Bates' son, recently released from a mental hospital, with Shannon's caustic tone perfect for his nonconformist character's bitter rants. Finally, Dylan Baker is a wryly delightful presence as DiCaprio's alcoholic co-worker who hides from the dismally monotonous workplace through drinks and witty criticisms.

Despite being a class act on all fronts, Revolutionary Road is in essence just as cinematically hollow as the lifestyle depicted, offering little new to offer regarding its subject matter. Nonetheless, the exceptional cast and powerfully measured direction cannot be ignored, nor can the film's lingering emotional clout. Yet, one cannot help wishing for untrod territory to be explored, or at least for Mendes to stay away from suburbia for future cinematic offerings.

Revolutionary Road,Mid-Century/Mid-Life Madness,10/8/2019,mel-hall,11-二月-09,"I loved this film, and I'm disappointed that it didn't receive more Oscar nods. I suspect it resonates more with women, than men. Not only are the roles of wife/mother/social being/etc. timeless, but I felt the crux of the story was April's descent into madness. She was not a well woman, and I see so little written up about it. She was not just dreamy-eyed about escaping the suburbs, but suffered from some sort of mental illness. I felt for her, and I agree that she was stronger than Frank, but her instability brought the couple's dynamic further down. Dreaming of dropping out, adultery, frustration over kids and suburban monotony are all part of (mid?) life, miserable as it may be at times. Frank tried to deal with them, though constricted by an exasperating, energy-draining wife. The 50s sets, costumes, etc. were beautiful, making the film more inviting to sink into, and I really appreciated everyone's performance. At first I, too, felt that poor, ageless Leo may be out of his league (I think that every time I see him, but then he settles into the role and, in no time, I am totally believing he is Howard Hughes!). And I noticed Frank's aging, too, or was it angst-ing? The Michael Shannon thing is a little lost on me. I just don't see that brief role as such a stretch. They say playing crazy is easy, but I say that Kate Winslet's slow slimmer to the pit of despair would be impossible for the average good actress in Hollywood to portray these days. And P.S. I would have preferred to see Kathy Bates get a nod for her role.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A difficult film to either like or to easily dismiss,10/7/2019,momentsoffilm,11-二月-09,"Adapted from the acclaimed literary novel by Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road is very difficult film either to like or to easily dismiss.

Richard Yates, in writing his book wanted to compare the brave revolutionary spirit upon which America had been founded to the spiritless conformism which had taken hold in the 50's as a result of McCarthyism, where people clung to safety and security at any price. The demise of April and Frank Wheeler's relationship and the price paid for the conformism of their contemporaries is meant to symbolise the last flicker of a dying American flame. Sadly the film, despite being truly well done, delivers no such comparison.

Sam Mendes adaptation is certainly stylish, perfectly detailed and brutally honest. Kate and Leo are both excellent, the art design superb and Roger Deakins captures it all with his usual cinematic eloquence. It's all very high calibre stuff but yet I found it really hard to like or find anything new, relevant or meaningful to me in this melodramatic story.

In fact in the 21st century that I inhabit, I'm not sure any of the themes of Revolutionary Road have relevance. Perhaps in another context, perhaps in another film they might, but to spend two hours with April and Frank and their crowd, however beautifully portrayed they are, is to spend two hours with horrible shallow stereotyped people more in love with their ideas about life than anything else including themselves or each other. Who on earth, however brilliantly the film is made, would truly want to spend a couple of hours getting bogged down in that mire when there are other choices.

I wanted to like Revolutionary Road, the filmmakers have tried to give me stuff to like, and I did like most every aspect of how it was made. I just didn't relate to the people or the situation it was about and cared nothing for this story. More than anything I want to watch films that make me feel something. Sadly this revolution was just not up my road.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Turning points come from outside,10/7/2019,shi612,11-二月-09,"I am 61 years old. I watched this movie with empathy reminding my 30s. Both husband and wife have strong upward desire but not contented. The husband seems he does not like his boss and his daily job. Thus they make their own big turning point, which is to sell everything and move to Paris, where the wife will work with high wage and the husband will seek something truly deserves to do. What a bold idea. However, while they are preparing for it, unexpected turning points come from outside. The husband's case is that his job is recognized and he is offered a new position with very good salary. For men, recognition and promotion are so attractive that all of dissatisfactions so far can be forgotten. I will not disclose what turning point comes to the wife to avoid spoiler. Anyhow, this is the story of a couple who lives on the road of symbolic name 'Revolutionary Road' and tries to make a revolutionary change in life, but faces unexpected turning points. I recall my wife and I had similar events in our 30's too. That is why I wrote I watched the movie with empathy.

Revolutionary Road,Dull Movie with Wooden characters,10/4/2019,gerrymcd,3-二月-09,"I really wanted to like this film kate winslet is great in it but the movie just doesn't work as a film. Its characters are just not believable and the core of the movie is just so dull that nothing interesting happens. Just because actors make a good performance in a movie sure doesn't mean the movie is worth watching.

There's no doubt Di Caprio is a very versatile actor and a good actor like Winslet but the film spends far too long ith the same story thread that it just becomes dull.

The ""mental"" neighbour is a joke, its like a character they just added who could point out the mess and problems that Winslet and Di Caprios characters have. Its such a lazy, lame wooden character used to put some kinda ""realism"" into the movie that it just fails big time.

Revolutionary Road,What happens to a dream deferred?,10/10/2019,commandercool88,4-一月-09,"'Revolutionary Road' digs and picks at a truth so awful and ugly that hiding it or pretending as though it doesn't exist is no longer an option. It is a festering sore below the surface. Ready to explode.

A 1950s Americana suburbia. Quaint little houses. Charming people. Green lawns filled with young rambunctious children. It is the image of desire, of success. But what goes on within those walls when the doors are closed to curious neighbors? What happens when the charming life you lead is anything but? A lie. A carefully constructed, well-manicured lie.

Sam Mendes leads the star-studded adaptation of Richard Yates' novel. It is an explosive observation of suburban life gone astray. Frank and April Wheeler find themselves playing the part. Doing what society tells them is the proper thing to do. Get married. Settle down. Have children. It is the life neither of them wanted. They abuse each other emotionally. Rip each other apart. Tear each other down. Because there is no one else to run to. No way out. No more fake it till you make it. 'Revolutionary Road' is a tragedy. A full-blown suburban tragedy.

The reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet find the two under very different circumstances than 'Titanic'. These are two extraordinary performances from two of today's greatest screen talents. They hold no punches in this haunting tale, exploding with powerful emotions that help make 'Revolutionary Road' one of the most explosively entertaining pictures of the year. These are two individuals stuck with each other. Desperately looking for a way out. Putting on a show even to each other, pretending and promising that everything can be okay. And Winslet, who has been criminally passed up for an Oscar five times now, gives this performance everything she can. It is an absolutely devastating but profound role.

Sam Mendes is no stranger to suburban turmoil. He directed 'American Beauty' with a fierce satirical eye. This time around, there's a much more suffocating sense of dread. It's a brooding atmosphere that intoxicates the senses, and 'Revolutionary Road' has a lot to say about this so-called American dream. Michael Shannon finds himself in the role of a mentally disturbed man, the son of the Wheeler's realtor. He makes keen observations about the world around him, and while his condition render his words as insanity, there is an undeniable truth to them. All the lies, all the emptiness. 'Revolutionary Road' is a downer, but difficult to argue against.

Hot to the touch, 'Revolutionary Road' stirs the pot and turns traditional expectations on its side. It's a disturbing tale of isolation and hopelessness. Mendes begs the question, at what cost? At what cost are we willing to put on this charade? To pretend to be something we aren't? It's one of this year's very best pictures, something that will leave a heavy shroud over you that's shockingly difficult to shake off.

Revolutionary Road,See it on DVD,10/7/2019,wuvvie,28-十二月-08,"Granted, you should not see this movie if you can't stand a movie that doesn't have explosions or knee-slappers every five minutes.

This movie discusses the mediocrity of today's definition of happiness.It successfully portrays the frustration of suburban life Bottom line, it's a touching movie that you should see on a rainy day, or after a breakup, alone. It can have deep meaning and become touching only if you see it at the right time.

Although Kate and Leo are great together, this movie is no Titanic. It's slow to take off, it's filled with expletives and lines that sound way too scripted. At the end of the movie, I just sighed and thought, ""well that's just too bad."" I think the director tried too hard to make this movie as it would occur in real life. That's great, but along with the ""reality sucks"" concept of this movie comes the eye-drooping mediocrity of the lives of the two main characters.

Kate and Leo do an excellent job of acting, though. And if you want to see what all the Oscar buzz is about - save the $8 and go rent it when it comes out.",neg
Revolutionary Road,What do these people really want?,10/10/2019,aharmas,4-一月-09,"Winslett is such an impressive performer because she manages to convey a natural., yet confident tone to her performance. I have rarely seen anyone show pain, despair, and confusion with so much conviction, without calling attention to the technical details, as some of our most outstanding performers do. She never seems to be acting; if it is almost as watching a real person on screen, and this make the impact even more powerful.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a dark odyssey for both leads. It never really explains how the trap caught, or the level and origin of the dissatisfaction experienced by just everyone in the film. There are many unhappy people here, but the big tragedy is that of the Wheelers, a couple that seems who have everything, yet they seem to be desperate for a new dream, and reaching that dream is an impossible task because they don't truly know what is stifling them, or what they really want.

It takes an insane man to reveal and voice their feelings, and this is the beauty of the way the story is told. Because a ruined mind/soul is the only voicing the tragic nature of everyone's pain; it's not heeded, and the impact of that scene just speeds up the descent into even more tragic developments.

In the end, the film is touches us. Still our frustrations and reactions are still bothering us because we have not experienced any cathartic release. The ending is bound to upset the majority in the audience, as it destroys the illusion of a time that embodied perfection in society and simplicity in the home. It is as if we hate what we are discovered but are still fascinated by it. ""Blue Velvet"" was an experiment, and it successfully opened the door, yet the souls of the freaks seem detached. In ""Revolutionary Road"", the people seem normal, stuck in a pleasant and normal situation that has gone wrong, but it is just realistic enough to make us feel that it could happen to us, too.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a phenomenal and disturbing movie, a strong artistic plunge into a world that we know exists but we can't find the courage to deal with.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Hugely underrated incredible film,10/9/2019,daxilic,8-八月-18,"Wow what a brilliant film! Scarily real and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to (but would never admit it). Top class acting all round and possibly an Oscar-worthy performance from Kate Winslet.

Revolutionary Road shows the dark side of the stereotypical American dream - Married with kids in a nice big house in suburban America with a good job you love and driving a nice car. This 'American dream' is just an illusion that people convince themselves is where true happiness lies. When those people achieve this dream they realise it's not actually what they want in life, and therefore has the opposite effect. Their reaction is to convince themselves that it's what they want and they are in fact happy. I can truly believe this happens to a lot of real people all the time.

One thing I love about the film is the amount of irony, especially John Giving's (Michael Shannon) character of being a mentally ill man who says crazy things, who in fact is the only sane character in the whole film. He says what he's thinking and what he sees, where everyone else is superficial and delusional.

Very underrated film and I believe the people giving it a negative review don't understand it because they are too narrow-minded and naive - much like most of the characters in the film. To those people: watch the latest Transformers or Fast and Furious film as it's probably more your taste :)",pos
Revolutionary Road,"OK, slow film, unbelievably fast sex, < 60sec to orgasm",10/6/2019,ArthurKaletzky,5-二月-09,"Now I know why the baby boom happened.

OK, slow film with unbelievably fast sex, < 60sec to orgasm of both participants. Was Mendes having length problems and rather than cutting the novel's text, cut the sex to the bone?

Close to being Winslet's best film work (I thought she was even better, but not nearly as beautiful, in Eternal Sunshine), but Mendes's weakest (I have not seen Jughead).

Other critics have written that the film is very theatrical and I agree. But the ambiance of the 1950s, which I remember from my childhood although that was not in the U.S., was very well done.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Interesting but nothing special,10/7/2019,Argemaluco,30-一月-09,"It's natural that Revolutionary Road provokes high expectations on the spectator.On the one hand,it's the return of director Sam Mendes to the ""domestic drama"" genre which gave him deserved success with American Beauty.And,on the other hand,it's the reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet after working together in the most successful film in the History of cinema (the enormously overrated Titanic).Although I liked Revolutionary Road,I found it to be a predictable drama,which lacks of any special element which would make it something memorable.In other words,this is a good movie but the screenplay completely lacks of some special element which would make it different to many movies from this style.And,something which bothered me from this movie is the obvious trick which uses on the last 15 minutes.That trick pretends to be the emotional climax from the story when in fact,it is a desperate trick for finding a ""strong"" way out after the soft drama from the rest of the movie.DiCaprio and Winslet bring excellent performances but the member who mostly stands out is Michael Shannon,who earned a very deserved Academy Award nomination for his extraordinary performance.Shannon brought a memorable work because his character stays with spectator a lot of time after the movie is over.Kathy Bates,Dylan Baker,Max Casella and Jay O. Sanders also bring solid performances.Mendes made a good work as a director.He directed his cast very well and he could find a good tone to this movie.I liked Revolutionary Road for all its good elements but the story,the most important aspect,did not totally convince me.And when the story is not completely solid,the final experience I have is not totally satisfactory.Still,I recommend Revolutionary Road as a good movie.It does and says the same we have seen and listened too many times but it does it well,with excellent performances and a good atmosphere.I think there are better works with the same ideas and messages (like the brilliant movies The Ice Storm and Far From Heaven and the ingenious TV programmes Married with Children and Desperate Housewives) but as I said,this movie deserves a recommendation in spite of not being completely satisfactory.",pos
Revolutionary Road,great performance for both Kate and Leonardo,10/10/2019,yulia_new,22-一月-09,"Im getting used to see great performances from these actors, they really fit well on screen. It's a great movie about 2 guys trying to get their marriage to work along with their dreams, a young couple who have kids and decides to move to Paris, to complete their dream. It's a simple story about something we all might experience one day. Frank is working hard to support the family, along with their 2 kids. April becomes insecure when Frank doesn't wanna go to Paris anymore, because she got pregnant, and he's the only one who wants to keep the baby.I was really impressed of Leo's performance, he should really get the Oscar for this one, and Kate as well. Good luck guys!

Revolutionary Road,"while all of us get better at lying (to ourselves), it remains impossible (for some) to forget the truth",10/8/2019,alerter,31-十二月-08,"  What happens if/when you look in a mirror and can't begin to admit that you don't really like what you see?

Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is a relentlessly bleak and compelling experience that can't be called an ""entertainment,"" but it's powerfully disturbing in ways that *art* can sustain, where ""conversations"" tend to die sudden deaths.

The Wheeler's are a 1950s married couple, complete with two kids and a house in the ""cozy"" CT burbs; but, like most of the repressed denizens of that day, they are failing at the ""Ozzie&Harriet""(TM) life, where 1+1 is supposed to =1 (""his"" one).

This house turns out not to be much of a home.

Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslett) are wholly disconnected and miserably incomplete. (The bedding on the sofa that April tends to in the first scene of her daily domestic ""bliss"" telegraphs that they haven't been sleeping together and not even in the same room.)

The two came together at a Bohemian ""Village"" party shortly after the close of WW2. Frank was an infantry veteran of the ETO, but remains a boy-man, floating from job-to-job and possessed with a ""charming"" frankness about himself. His only real ambition, besides not winding up like his Old Man, is to make his aimless, male prerogative bachelor ends meet. April was an aspiring actress with mildly diva-ish pretensions. April considers herself ""special,"" superior to the herds of lemming-like '50s conformity. She thinks she sees in Frank the most interesting man she's ever met and extrapolates that to also mean a kindred spirit. What Frank sees in April is the most stunning woman at the party who's willing to enter into his conversational orbit. It's a match filled with both promise and peril.

Bun in the oven, the two marry and assemble the customary pieces of life needed to Play House, still fueled by a young and otherwise untested love. As they travel down a road of material practicality, though, safety becomes conformity and deep disenchantment. Whatever ""special""-ness they might've thought they shared got lost along the way.

Frank and April become almost exactly like all of the other suburban drones that they once considered themselves to be vastly superior to. April, as it turns out, might not be an actress, after all, for all of her formal studies. Frank is an Ad Man working for the same Gray Flannel company that his Old Man once toiled for over in Sales.

April is the more desperate of the two, because her days are filled with the small trials of raising of two children in the isolated social barrenness of a not-quite-arrived suburbia. The kids rarely turn to Frank when he's home. Frank has the daily diversions of his commute into NYC, the shallow banter of his co-worker AdMan flacks and the distractions of the secretarial pool. April feels trapped. Frank is feeling 30. Each seems to have only the other to blame for their predicament.

None of the ""others,"" who also inhabit this story, who don't openly aspire to April's personal sense of ""specialness,"" are altogether pleased with their own lives, either, but they repeatedly choose resignation.

This is a time when women were routinely *diagnosed* as being ""hysterical"" (as if it were a XX-chromosomal disease) and social non-conformists sentenced to ""funny farms"" and electro-shock ""therapy."" Nothing at all wrong with Society, so all problems have to be individual. All of these details serve to illustrate the hairline fissures in custom and culture that would erupt in the decades to follow.

Frank and April each embark on their own extra marital affair. And, even in that, April's options prove to be more desperate and less superficially gratifying than Frank's. (Think three-minute wonders here, and April's refusal to even pretend that Shep has anything to do with ""love."")

 ...

Do any of us know even one couple, today, that's in the grips of a Wheeler-ish predicament?

Have any of us ever bellowed, or muttered, any of the caustic lines in the film toward anyone that we claim to positively care about?

Does any husband, today, turn up his iPod in order to tune out his wife and/or the kids?

Which is worse? An act of martial infidelity or all of the tiny little deaths/failings in a committed relationship that come before?

Even if women truly have more personal/individual choices available to them, today, than they did in the 1950s, don't almost all of these come with additional burdens, stemming from perniciously persistent gender roles that have more to do with sociology than biology?

When women, in particular, are made to suffer, are men immune to any/all collateral damage?

These and other questions raised by this film make it either a riveting watch or completely obtuse.

There's no way to see RR and remain unmoved.

I praise the terrific acting of Winslett, DiCaprio and Shannon (as the lone, sanely astute commentator in this brutally tragic story). I also credit Mendes for his direction and Haythe's screenplay adaptation of the Yates' novel, despite the role of Frank being so internally pared down.

This is a very tough film to have a shallow conversation about, because it is whithering social commentary, none of which is safely buried 53 years in *our* past. The contradictions depicted in the film are very much alive today, dressed with more modern veneers, as we face a real possibility of entering into a Great Depression II of our own collective making and *continue* to question a woman's right to reproductive choices.

This isn't the best film of this year, in my book; but it's a must see and quite possibly a litmus test for where we are in our own lives today.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Challenging film,10/9/2019,luke-mosse,30-十二月-08,"I've always thought that Leonardo DiCaprio was a very underrated actor, although Titanic probably puts a lot of people of the scent of his acting skills, it is quite anomaly in his acting career, most of which is exceptional. For example, before Titanic he had a very interesting role in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape', in which I didn't even recognise him and only realised it was him when I saw the credits, he was that believable. I think in his case he is in some people's eyes restrained by his youthful physicality but nevertheless, does possess range, charisma and authenticity in abundance.

I thought this film was astonishing - very difficult to watch at times, as the arguments were so real, ferocious and sprawling. But I found it was in that starkness and reality that the compassion of the film came through, as it was so unblinking in confronting such difficult and ego-ridden issues. The characters were so believably self-contradictory, and confused, it was just like real life! I think this film might come across as a bit of a drag if you expect to be entertained rather than very hardly prodded. This is the type of movie that does invade your head space, but without providing any simplistic morality or easy answers. The plot is inconclusive and leaves a lot of unresolved tension, and it's definitely a film that asks more questions than it answers. For that reason I really liked it, but I can understand that others who see life as considerably less fraught with tension might wonder - what's all this fuss about?!",pos

Revolutionary Road,Worse than Titanic,10/1/2019,dramawatcher,8-三月-10,"I didn't like that film. It appeared to be about an unhappy couple drifting apart because of their personal problems. That's something that always has gone on in real life. It might appeal to some people but I can't really handle real life tragic events like that. The ending was worse where April decides to abort her child and died in the process. Her wanting to do that was one thing that was breaking up the marriage. Abortion was apparently illegal in 1950s but there were people running there own abortions or worse aborting their own children. They were not trained medical people and some women died in the process. Some people take an interest in that but I prefer fantasy. I have taken in interest in history as well when it's about something that really did happen.

Titanic starring the same actors wasn't the best of films. It appears to be a made up story set on a real life ship. It at least shows what happened to the ship, people saying it can't sink, how it hit the iceberg, the damage caused, not enough life boats and what happened as a result.

In general I'd say both actors have been in better films.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Enough with bashing suburban life,10/3/2019,meesh1009,1-一月-10,"I am so sick of watching movie after movie bash suburban life as some sort of collecting bin for sellouts. Makes me want to wear an apron and pearls around the house just to be spiteful.

Kate Winslet's penchant for choosing roles (and husbands who direct movies) that diminish the importance of doing what's right in life indicate am immaturity that will become more and more unattractive as her body stubbornly continues to age, leaving her brain behind. Selfish, unrealistic, and simplistic, her characters (and herself) seem so indulgent that I feel like I'm watching a 3 year old have a temper tantrum every time she's on screen. Kate, sweetie, growing up is actually incredibly freeing...you should try it.

The movie industry's obsession with mocking the American family unit, although quite transparent and cliché in movies of the last thirty years, has also unfortunately been quite effective. The nuclear family is under attack, along with the American dream. The Artistic Elite dance a jig at the realization that their incessant pounding in films is successfully ushering societal norms to their doom; rising divorce rates, out of wedlock births, and abortions continue to feed the Left's gleeful attacks on family values. Congratulations, Hollywood...the propaganda you've been pumping out for the last decades is coming to fruition, culminating with the sheeple's unquestioning adoration of tripe like ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Little Children"", to name only two.

The fact that one Hollywood couple (Mendes and Winslet) account for such a large majority of these types of films says so much about what I assume goes on behind closed doors in THEIR home.",neg
Revolutionary Road,The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living,10/10/2019,piverba,8-一月-09,"If you are interested in entertainment then get an ""Iron Man"" or something like this – and this is not to be taken as a reproach, sometime we need just mindlessly relax. However if you would like to entertain meaning of your own life and re-examine its fundamental principles then this film is for you. Yes, this is Oskar-price material, in all respects, and I did enjoy it very much and not likely to forget any time soon. This is not mindless and manipulative, self-serving sludge, but something you can take home with you, keep and use it to improve your own life.

The ""Revolutionary Road"" is not necessarily a street name; rather it is an attitude toward life. And so what if Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) are both seem to be an ""ordinary people""? They loved the house on ""Revolutionary Road"" - understand this as a symbol of self-creation. When we are young we are all 'potentiality', we are a blank slate to be filled with anything. Soon we settle and stop dreaming, stop examining our lives – this is like death. After a while, Frank's and April's lives became rather mundane, not 'revolutionary'. This became the physical death of April and the emotional death of Frank. Although Frank physically survives and now dedicated his life to his children, his responsibility to himself, as individual, is unfulfilled and there is no future for him as a person.

The only authentic person in this story is Bill (Michael Shannon), who's happened to be psychotic and who undergone 27 shock therapy treatments, correction that society administer to make one socially acceptable; after all we can not just allow anyone forget their responsibility, don't we? He comes to the ""Revolutionary Road"" and feels at the right place, until Frank and April veer off this road. He's like their self-consciousness, unwavering and brutally honest; self-consciousness they would violently banish (Frank almost hits him and April is also angry at him). The fact that he is psychotic is another confirmation of his symbolism as anti-social construct of human psyche.

The film does not answer any specific question, it only raise and examine issues from several perspectives. It strongly asserts that we must treat our lives very seriously, not just live them. It is not that we need to give up everything and move to Paris, no! Paris is not a place, it is a state of being where you still have dreams of self fulfillment and constantly reexamining your life seeking meaning of your existence. When other people allude to Frank and April that, literally taken, moving to Paris, is ill conceived, they are neither wrong nor shortsighted. Literally moving to Paris will not solve any problem; moving to 'Paris' must be done psychologically, as an act of self-reevaluation. And it is not a matter of responsibilities toward people you love, its most of all responsibility toward yourself, to know that you are not settled (i.e. dead) but actively seeking meaning of your existence, that you are 'full of life and blood' as Frank said – for if you stop this process you are also not very good for the people you love.

Another interesting feature of the film is that it considers both freedom and constraint as dialectic opposites. Some people operate well and are very creative and fulfilled while constrained by a situation. You can always strive to be the best you can at you job, or be a good mother or father. Social constraints are not necessarily evil. For instance, look at the constraint of a religion – it is dogmatic but within these hard set canonical boundaries there is a great opportunity to improvise and achieve great results. On the other hand, some people can not deal with any constraint. Such people either create their own rules or are perpetually miserable while forced to live by rules of others. The former are the stuff from which great people are made of, the latter are eternally miserable.

These are different facets of the human condition which is an essence of our nature. This film quietly and seriously deals with these important issues. It is a worthy addition to our path toward better self-knowledge.",pos
Revolutionary Road,An incredibly HEAVY & ACCURATE portrayal of the greatest obstacle in life,10/9/2019,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,8-一月-09,"I guess Sam Mendes is a pretty dependable director. This is a near perfect movie.

One of the heavy, sad themes of the movie is ""letting go of your inner child"". There are people that are fortunate enough to be put in positions that allow them to keep this part of themselves alive for their entire lives, but the truth is that isn't usually the case.

The movie is a tale of 2 wonderful, creative, intelligent people basically being torn to pieces by everything that forms our world. In the end, I feel that behind it all, if Kate and Leo's characters were allowed to do exactly what they wanted to with their lives, they would have stayed in love and in a healthy relationship until death. Unfortunately, life does not always allow people to do whatever they've always dreamed of doing. That rarely seems to be the case, sadly enough.

So here, you are presented with the demise of their love story. Yes, it is as depressing as you would assume it is and as depressing as people tell you it is.

This movie sums up the biggest obstacle in life.

What is ultimately the most dependable source of happiness in life? LOVE. What is the number one obstacle that gets in the way of making LOVE last? LIFE ITSELF. Everything else...

It's a heavy movie and it certainly isn't going to make you feel great, but HELLO, this is a realistic portrayal of just what is going on every day. This is a struggle that ANYONE with a heart and a brain has to deal with, and therefore it is a universally powerful film.

Of course there couldn't be much better candidates to star than Leo and Kate, they both made it beyond believable. Viewers complain that they couldn't get into the movie because they didn't like the characters - I think they need to realize that even the best people can go into psychotic, helpless, horrible phases once life has them by the balls.

I also loved ""the lunatic"" who wasn't a lunatic at all just simply a man who had the world figured out a little too intensely and could see right through it, therefore had lost his desire to be a part of the system. Unfortunately there are people like all over the world. It's unfortunate that sometimes the most intelligent ones are the ones who lose the desire to maintain a ""stable life"". In the 50's I don't think this was as common as it seems to be now, so I guess they put him in a loony bin for his views... I got along with him great though!!!

Sam Mendes knew exactly what he was doing. That's all I have to say.

Blaaaaaa this movie just tackled so many of the most powerful and engaging things in life that I cannot stress how good it was. I could go on and on but I'm going to stop myself right here. I want to see it again, right now. God dammit.",pos
Revolutionary Road,This Road is Hard to Walk Through,10/10/2019,ClaytonDavis,8-一月-09,"(a short review) Leo and Kate are incredible and deserve a much needed Oscar nomination. For Winslet the win seems inevitable. Michael Shannon's brief screen time is enough to leave him embodied and printed into your soul. Kathy Bates is heartbreaking in a role she could have easily walked through but makes it nearly authentic.

Director Mendes creates stunning moments that literally strike fear into the heart of the viewer. Deakins great cinematography is always crisp. Editing keeps a stunning pace. Thomas Newman's score is to die for.

The second best film of the year! ****/****

Revolutionary Road,Amazing!,10/9/2019,Sinisstarfreak17,7-一月-09,"""I'll never let go jack, Ill Never Let Go"". Those were the last words that Kate Winslet said to Leonardo Di'Caprio just over 10 years ago in the film we all know as Titanic. A film which would be known to almost every human on earth. 10 years later the first words that would rekindle the on screen duo would be ""So what do you do?"" ""Im Studying to be an actress"" would be the reply.

Here is my REVOLUTIONARY ROAD review.

First off, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is not a movie for everyone. The movie is extremely slow and all it does is focus around a married couple living in a suburban community in the 1950's. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes who also directed the Oscar Nominated film American Beauty. My first complaint being that i felt this movie was just a little to much like American Beauty only set in a different time period, but i loved that movie so this was just as good to me. I just wish Sam Mendes could come out of the box a little bit and try something a little broader.

Frank and April Wheeler are both around 30 with two kids who think that they can escape the traps of existence they have chosen. The movie begins with them meeting at a party and then goes straight to the marriage Frank works at a job he hates but continues there because the money is decent. April is an ""actress"" who believes she is destined for better things. One day April comes up with the idea just to drop everything, move to Paris and live the rest of their lives their. She can work as a Government secretary and Frank can ""find himself"". April later finds out she is 10 weeks pregnant. Could this stop them from going to Paris? Will they ultimately just be stuck on REVOLUTIONARY ROAD for the rest of their lives while Frank works at his crap poor job? What keeps them together? Is It Love or something else? The story of the characters was absolutely amazing. Some scenes I could not turn away from. I just sat there an gazed in trance at what was going on. The last 30 minutes of the movie really stand out. It was the last 30 minutes that I could not stop thinking about for a day. And the last scene in the movie. It has the Givings (neighbors) talking about Revolutionary Road and the new family that lives on the road. It is a scene that ends the movie perfectly, because it shows what could have been had things gone another way. I can not reveal what i mean by this exactly to those who have not seen the movie. But for those who have, they will know what i am talking about. It basically shows how the wheelers would have been had things gone a different way.

The viewer should know in the first 15 minutes if it is going to be a movie that they should walk out of or stay and see what it has to offer.

The movie is called Revolutionary Road because that is the road that they live on. My thoughts to the reason given for the title is because the movie is not just about Frank and April but about their neighbors and friends. The movie is Extremely realistic to most romances. Being married is not all about the high life. People cheat on each other. People like to try to act like the perfect family around others and then go home and be the exact opposite. That is life. This is what makes the movie brilliant. After viewing the movie i honestly did not know how i felt about it I knew the performances were amazing. All of them I would say Leo delivers the performance of his lifetime, and so does Kate. I really hope that it finally knocks her the Oscar she deserves.

To be honest though, to me the most noted performance of the whole movie is actually by Michael Shannon. Michael having done most villainous roles or quick cameos really puts it all into his character. Michael plays John Givings who is a mathematician and has been hospitalized for insanity due to his genius thoughts and the fact that he says what everyone else wants to. It is his character to me that really opens up the movie and at times will make you laugh and get away from the dark moments surrounding the character. This goes back to the part where I talked about the title coming from the characters. John is the son of a couple that lives on Revolutionary Road and they try to act like they are perfect. They go over Frank and Aprils quite often and never mention their son until he gets out where they must confess that he is not right in the head and then actually have them meet with Frank and April. Later John has a scene with at the dinner table that i think should be remembered for a long time.

The movie is very dark. The moments are dark. It goes deep into relationships and it goes deep into suburban life. This may be why it reminds me so much of American Beauty. The movie was so deep that as said before i did not know how i felt about the movie. I literally was thinking about the events and actions in the movie for the whole next day. I rate this as one of the best movies of 2008. It was so deep and dark.

I give this movie a 9 out of 10. But like i said it is not for everyone. Only for those who are really into the development of characters or deep stories. I guess if you like American Beauty then there is a 80% chance you will like this as well.",pos

Revolutionary Road,What is the point of Leonardo di Caprio?,10/6/2019,paul2001sw-1,21-一月-12,"Sam Mendes 'American Beauty' was in my opinion overpraised: the script, a satire on suburban life, had its share of funny and perceptive moments, but ultimately pulled its punches. The director is back on the same territory with 'Revolutionary Road', only this time, his story is set in the 1950s. The look and feel of that decade is immaculately reconstructed (though were American kitchens really this modern?), but the tale is sadly simpler than his previous film, and amounts to little more than the assertion that suburban life is rubbish, even for the prosperous. There are few unexpected twists to the script, a ponderous and over-present background score, and to make it worse, Leonardo di Caprio plays the male lead. I can understand that when he was younger, women found him cute; but as an adult actor, he never fails to disappoint, decorating every role he with the same self-important whining. To me, he's an unappealing protagonist and fails to command my sympathy. The truth is, not everyone can direct films for a living, and if you can't, a life in the suburbs is probably as good as any. Of course, that's not to say that everyone is happy there; but the darkness in human hearts does not come from real estate and a garden, and I didn't see much insight into the deeper causes here.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road,10/7/2019,random_avenger,14-八月-10,"Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are a young married couple living with their two kids in Connecticut in the 1950s. Their life is basically fine, but both long for more: he is disillusioned with his steady but boring office job, while she feels suffocated by the quiet life of a housewife. To escape their dull reality, April suggests they move to France and start over there, finally realizing their old, buried dream. Although initially excited about the idea, Frank and April soon have to face many difficulties life throws at them – the move to Europe starts seeming less and less sensible. Is there any way to overcome their desperation?

The Wheelers' idea seems laughably idealistic at first, but the feeling of being trapped by the endless responsibilities of respectable life is easy to identify with, and in the end their planned move is not at all difficult to understand. The ironically bright and sunny cinematography and the fact that the story is set in the narrow-minded 1950s add to the mood of deadly pleasantness too. The most telling of the scenes may be the conversation where April explains that she never wanted to get out of her life, but in it.

One of the film's main assets is the acting. Especially Kate Winslet performs her part with masterful precision; every small emotion comes to life on her face without ever looking unnatural or exaggerated. DiCaprio does a good job too, but his credibility as a serious adult is sadly diminished by his youthful, boyish looks (perhaps a cliché criticism, but I cannot ignore it). The Wheelers' situation is also reflected to their family friends Shep and Milly who are implied to be going through similar sentiments but with less self-confidence; David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn convey this feel of unspoken envy with ease. Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mentally unstable former mathematician, also deserves a nod for his portrayal of the seemingly aggressive but ultimately bitter and self-pitying speaker of truth; so does his on-screen mother Helen, played by Kathy Bates.

Together DiCaprio, Winslet and director Mendes craft a well-made drama that evokes memories from Mendes' first hit American Beauty (1999). Especially the haunting music at the end of Revolutionary Road immediately leads thoughts to Lester Burnham and Co. but the emphases are different in both films. Perhaps the newer film could have used a little more of element of surprise to raise it into the master class, but it is an enjoyable, if forlorn, tale of anxiety at any rate.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Beating a dead horse,10/5/2019,John_Truby,7-一月-10,"Revolutionary Road is one of those rare ambitious dramas Hollywood puts out during Oscar season to make it look like they care about people older than a teenager. They don't. If you want to see top drama, you have to go to American television, respected around the world for its excellence. I was recently in Paris to teach the 22 Step Great Screen writing Class, and all the press wanted to talk about - print, radio and television - was the amazing writing on American TV dramas like Mad Men, The Wire, and Lost.

Everyone had high hopes for Revolutionary Road, since it's based on a much-loved novel of the 50s by Richard Yates. But that just makes the film all the more depressing. And that's because the writing is shockingly deficient. This film is actually a fascinating case study for screenwriters and directors, especially when you compare it to American Beauty. Both films were directed by Sam Mendes. Both explore the sterility of marriage in the suburbs. But one is a modern classic while the other is a sincere but undeniable failure.

What's the difference? The script of course. These two films are yet another proof that the screenwriter, not the director, is the true author of the film. And when a film fails, we have to go to the script to find the causes.

Like American Beauty, Revolutionary Road bases its story on as ambitious a theme as a modern-day writer can take on: how do you live a meaningful life in middle-class suburban America? Suburbia promises that we're all the king or queen of own castle. But once you are living comfortably in that castle, are you really free? Is that the true recipe for a good and satisfying life? Revolutionary Road takes on that vast and complex theme full bore, and what power it has comes from a theme that challenges people where they live, and how they live, like no other theme can. It forces the audience to take a lifetime perspective on their own lives, and very few films or TV shows do that.

But an ambitious theme is also much harder to pull off. And Revolutionary Road's technique, its artistry, is simply not up to the task. In fact the film is so alienating in its techniques that it loses even those in the audience who really want it to succeed. Plot is virtually non-existent; it hits the same beat in almost every scene (to be fair, some of that blame must go to the novelist). This forces the dialogue to carry the story, something dialogue cannot do.

As a result, the dialogue in almost every scene is overtly thematic, on-the-nose and on the same subject: live your passion, escape your dull suburban life. We thought we were special, we want a better future, but we find we're like everyone else.

Okay, I get it. Mendes has said, ""It might be more difficult to distance yourself from the opinions of the writer and the filmmaker"" if the film is set in the present, whereas ""you never feel lectured to or instructed when you're watching a period film."" Not so. This shows a glaring lack of understanding of what makes great dramatic writing.

With such a lack of technical artistry in the storytelling, the question of course becomes why. As always the reasons become clear when we explore the story's structure, and especially when we apply the seven major structure steps. It turns out that the battle scene - the biggest and final conflict between the hero and the opponent - which usually comes at the climax of the story, comes here at the beginning. In the opening scene the two leads meet in a bar. Each is full of promise. In the third scene, the two characters, now married for many years, have a vicious fight in which they lay out every argument the story will express. In effect, the story is over in the third scene! In a good battle scene at the end of the story, the writer can and should make the competing values of the characters explicit. This is where the theme first pops in the mind of the audience. And it pops with power because until then it has been woven below the surface through the story structure. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk extensively about how to express a theme powerfully, through a moral argument of action. In other words, by what the characters do in the story. Instead of sending a message, you move and inspire an audience from their core.

The seven steps are what make thematic power possible, because they are the way a good story develops organically. When you ignore the natural unfolding of these steps, as for example when you push the battle scene to the front, the thematic elements are flashed in big neon letters. The audience backs off. And the story has nowhere to go. A story is like a shark; it always has to be moving. When it stops, it dies.

Another way to see Revolutionary Road's failure is to see it as the drama of inaction. April's solution to her and Frank's suburban paralysis is to say to her husband: maybe you could go to Paris and find yourself. Sounds good, but it doesn't mean anything. I'm not arguing that this attempt to find meaning isn't real. Our lives are full of things we might have done, along with solutions we desperately construct that are as flimsy as tissue paper. But that doesn't make for good drama.

Revolutionary Road is a great example in story terms of beating a dead horse. I feel bad for the horse, but I wish I could have stopped watching a long time ago.",neg
Revolutionary Road,not much revolutionary about this,10/3/2019,MLDinTN,27-十二月-09,"What a disappointing movie. Not much happens. It's basically about a couple, Frank and April, and how they argue all the time. April is basically a basket case; crying a lot and telling Frank she doesn't love him any more. Frank has affairs; she doesn't care. She has them herself.

The couple have 2 kids; however, they are hardly in the movie. That didn't make sense. I know at one point the kids where supposed to be gone somewhere, but the movie never said. And at other times, like when the couple would be eating dinner, the kids were missing. That was just weird.

At the end of the movie, April does something destructive with severe consequences. She truly need to see a psychiatrist.

FINAL VERDICT: Boring, it's mainly a movie about arguing. I don't recommend it.",neg
Revolutionary Road,You Say You Want A Revolution? It's Not Here.,10/3/2019,geekroad,24-十二月-09,"This movie gets three stars for having the great talents of Leo, Kate and Kathy Bates in it. If not for them, it wouldn't rate any stars. It boggles my mind that so many people gave this movie a high rating.

The story begins with a fight and if you turn off the movie after that first scene, you can save yourself the extra two hours. There is no story arc beyond what your assumption would be from that first fight. Nothing unexpected happens, and no one changes in the film from the people you see in that first fight. It is so boring I was willing the time counter to move faster. If it weren't for Kate and Leo starring in it, I would have turned it off, but felt an annoying obligation to watch, thinking maybe there would be something more just around the next corner. No such luck.

Revolutionary Road left out the revolution and revelation while promising expectations that never get delivered. Yes everyone has dreams and some people are fearful of reaching for them, some settle and are happy with that and others can't abide settling. Any other way of expressing that theme would have been more interesting than the un-revolutionary, unremarkable, downright banal road this film took.",neg
Revolutionary Road,It could have been for stage,10/5/2019,cemcorder,20-十二月-09,"If ""Revolutionary Road"" were a theater play it could have been written by some Eugene O'Neil, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Sam Shepard or Travis Litt.

Indeed, it fits perfectly well in the row of American family drama written for the last decade. ""Revolutionary Road"", in some aspects even seems like it is a mixture of plays from above mentioned playwrights. Certain moments are reminiscent of some ""Death of a Salesmen"" by Miller e.g. Frank Wheeler's job, working at the same place where his father has worked for twenty years. Some other moments remind of ""Buried Child"" by Sam Shepard, especially with the symbolism of nature, fertility and the rejection of the own child. Tenessee Williams' play ""Stairs to the Roof"", however, seems to be the most relevant play for this film. Wheeler working on the ""15th floor"" of some business building, his unsatisfied life with his desire to escape and his unfaithfulness to his wife are just a few similarities to mention. With all these resemblances, one could argue that this material was never intended to be produced as a film. But Richard Yates, the writer of the novel, obviously liked the idea and Sam Mendes, known director since ""American Beauty"", liked it as well.

And so, this Hollywood-product came to surface. ""Revolutionary Road"", in some constant tension between fantasy and reality, between naturalism and some surreal, absurd, does indeed, achieve some great moments of high tension but due some weak moments of acting, especially by the wrong-cast of Leaonardo Di-Caprio and the film's (the studios?) wish to stay ""mainstream"", ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to prevail this tension and simply falls apart into the simplicity of some exaggerated narcissism piece.

Mendes's decision, the use of several one-shot scenes, allowing it's actors to unfold their capabilities and the audience to be closer to the protagonists, could've been some courageous act but Mendes does not seem capable to fully stretch the scenes in its dramaturgy and push them towards a even longer and provocative tendency. Therefore even longer transitions still turn up as some hasty, impatient cuts. Maybe it was his in-confidence in acting, maybe it was simply the difficulty to wrap up initial moments of the novel and leave others out, and maybe it was just to fulfill the American audience desire for faster cuts. Whatever reason it was, it caused to lower the tension of the film, it's directness and it's power.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"Familiar Territory, Much Over-praised",10/4/2019,gelman@attglobal.net,14-十二月-09,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a not-very-good recapitulation of a certain mind-set about the 1950's previously explored by ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" ""Organization Man"" and ""Little Boxes Made of Ticky- Tacky."" Sam Mendes has been down this road before (American Beauty) and done it better.

In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio is already past his prime as a high voltage star, and, although she was praised for her role in this movie, Kate Winslet is no longer an appropriate co-star for DiCaprio. She's a far better actor and their scenes together give off the dampest of sparks.

It's the premise of this movie that fails to convince me. Despite the critics, most adults in the 1950's were seeking high paying jobs (which did not bore them to death) and most couples wanted a home in the suburbs to raise their kids. True, the system was hardest on the wives. Many of them were college educated and struggled with the wifely routine that society imposed on them. The Feminist movement had not yet caught fire. When I was a young adult in the 1950's, college educated women stayed home to raise the kids but they also found an outlet in community affairs and other worthwhile activities. Most of the women I knew returned successfully to the work force when the kids were old enough.

It's not clear whether Winslet's character has been to college -- only that she has ambitions, first, to be an actress and, second, to quit the Connecticut suburbs for Paris. DiCaprio's ""organization man"" is also drawn to the Paris idea but two developments interfere. First, the wife becomes pregnant with their third child, and second, the husband is offered a substantial promotion.

The rest of the story is melodramatic and will not be summarized here. Kate Winslet has proved her mettle as an actor, and she does the best she can with a weak role. DiCaprio also does the best he can (which is not very much) with his role. And Mendes should have stood in bed. I awarded this a 4 only because of Winslet. She IS an amazing actress. Frankly, the worst thing about Revolutionary Road is that it was completely boring.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Intense yet subtle suburban drama with amazing acting,10/9/2019,Quebec_Dragon,11-十一月-09,"Revolutionary Road is an oddly appropriate and ironic title since it involves 2 smart unconventional young American people in the fifties who want to make their own personal ""revolution"" by changing their life. They never felt as if they fit in and it's also why they were partly attracted to each other in the first place. This films marks also the reunion between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, their first since Titanic. Those two turned out to be a few of the greatest actors of their generation and not only are they fully in control of their amazing acting gifts, their chemistry is undeniable. The rest of the cast is completed by fine actors especially the disturbed former engineer. I compare to Titanic but it's more intimate than epic, more suburban drama than romance although there's a fair bit of it that encounters the pitfalls of convention, hypocrisy and fear of change. Revolutionary Road is much closer in spirit to American Beauty by the same director.

It's based on an 1961 novel but I found that most of the issues explored are still valid today. Perhaps not how Kate Winslet's character would act in the second half (although it's understandable for the period) but more how certain values and peer pressure can create obstacles preventing us from reaching true happiness and how people react to it. Actually, beyond the couple's conflict, it's the clash of different values that was fascinating to me. It's very dramatic in parts but also subtle emotionally and psychologically. None of the characters are outright bad, they're just human and flawed. I was engrossed by the story and the characters. If there's a slight weakness, it would be that not enough time was spent on showing exactly how the 2 main characters thought differently than the rest of society. I also see how some viewers might be bored by the limited scope and ticked at some of the personal actions taken. One of my joys was to guess what would happen next at certain pivotal events and trying to guess what was taking place inside the character's heads. The dialogues were great, sounded right and were delivered perfectly. The production design was top-notch and nothing seemed out of place or anachronistic although I'm not a specialist of that era. I think Revolutionary Road was indeed one of the best dramas of 2008 and it deserved all the accolades it got.

Revolutionary Road,"For what it is, it's well done!",10/8/2019,Gunn,28-九月-09,"This is not a movie I'd want to see when I'm in a downer mood. I do get the film's message, that marriage can be a struggle for some. Being a single guy who never married, sometimes I wish I'd married and other times I'm glad I didn't. Watching this film I saw what a struggle it can be and back in the 50s divorce was pretty much scorned upon. So many people lived loveless marriages. Many made the best of the situation. Most folks I know seem to have adapted well and make the best of their marriages. To this day I see very few couples holding hands or snuggling up. It seems that marriage isn't what it's cracked up to be for a lot of people or is it that as people age they're less affectionate, at least in public. Revolutionary Road begins with the initial and strong attraction between the principle characters. Was it love or just physical attraction? As the marriage goes on they settle into the ""American Dream"", a nice house, a well paying but boring job, two little beautiful kids. After the marriage all is well until the monotony moves in. They make plans to move to Paris, kids and all, to fulfill their dreams but then reality hits them and she becomes pregnant. They grow tired of each other and everything gets worse. There are reasons for all of this and they are evident. Sam Mendes has put a beautiful, but very sad story, on screen brilliantly. It takes place in the 1950s and the art direction is fabulous. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as is the supporting cast. Thomas Newman's music score is perfection as is Roger Deakins cinematography. I prefer happier, more uplifting films but I must admit that this is a very good film!",pos
Revolutionary Road,Powerful but Flawed message...,10/8/2019,bluekarma06,17-九月-09,"Yea, this was a powerful movie about an young unhappy 1950's suburban couple. Was it the husband who made it thus or was it the wife? Was it her insistence on them leaving and re-sparking the idealism that attracted them in first place? Was it her dreams that she couldn't let go of? There is an old saying that ""wherever you go, there you are"". Bottom line is you can't hide from yourself. You can run to Paris, but when you get there you soon find out that it isn't the people or the place that makes you what you are, but it is what you are already! Yea, she wanted to become and actress, but would she of been a better actress in gay Paree? So often we think things will be better somewhere else, that the grass is greener. Hey, grass is grass no matter what color it is! Everywhere you go in this world, people are dealing and coping with life. No one can predict what might of happened in Paris had they moved there. When you dream, you mostly dream about the good stuff, the post card scenery but you forget that even in Paris they have slums. I liked the film for its performances but the bottom line is that you choose your life. You choose it every second. You can't UN-choose it or choose it in advance. You get what you get. All the crying and whining and complaining won't make a difference because when you get somewhere else, you will find plenty to complain about there after the novelty wears off. The subtle yet brilliant ending with the older couple and the husband that turns down his hearing aid as his wide babbles on, as his way of dealing with his life was probably missed by most viewers.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Desultory Look at Eisenhower-Era Marital Discord Showcases Sharp Work from Winslet and Shannon,10/6/2019,EUyeshima,6-七月-09,"It took 47 years to adapt for the screen Richard Yates' celebrated novel of the struggles that a young suburban couple faces living within the constraints of Eisenhower-era conformity. Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV. In fact, it often feels a bit like an extended episode of the 1950's-set AMC series, ""Mad Men"", although the arguments between the protagonists bring to mind similarly visceral set pieces from Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Adapted by screenwriter Justin Haythe (""The Clearing""), the plot focuses on Frank and April Wheeler, an attractive couple settled in a Connecticut suburb with two young children and seven years into a dysfunctional marriage. The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.

Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support the another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film, ""American Beauty"", in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.

This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role. Her former ""Titanic"" co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio has proved to be an arresting actor in ""The Departed"", but his baby face and youthful demeanor really seem at odds with Frank's weakening emotional state and diminishing sense of self-worth. He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another ""Titanic"" veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively contemplative husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon makes Helen's mentally ill son a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road"".",pos
Revolutionary Road,Call me betrayed,10/4/2019,Absyrd,30-六月-09,"I don't know what to say. I love Sam Mendes, I love the actors involved, I'm sure it's an alright book, but this, what a lifeless bore of a film. It establishes its point within the first five minutes and spends the next two hours following this psychotic couple as they whine about everything wrong with their pathetic lives. It's just... empty, it leaves me absolutely nothing at all to ponder with, a totally opposite reaction from Mendes' previous work, all which contain 10 times the charm, beauty, humor, and depth of this film. If only its script was quite as compelling as the performances and ravishing cinematography, then we might've had something worthwhile. A professional travesty.

Revolutionary Road,Idealistic relationship isn't so special.,10/7/2019,michaelRokeefe,9-六月-09,"Malaise, disappointment and dreams destroyed in 1950s suburban Connecticut. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates are together again for the first time since sharing a ride on the classic TITANIC. This time a tense tale of a young couple whose rosy and perfect relationship steadily deteriorates after a cancerous bitterness invades their new upper middle class home on the hill on Revolutionary Road. Frank(DiCaprio)and April(Winslet)always saw themselves as special. Everyone that knew them treated them special. Their high ideals start crumbling with jealousy, meaningless bickering and infidelity. Depression and lack of passion contribute to faded hopes and their abandoned young dreams. It seems that the only one that makes sense anymore is their friend and real estate lady's(Bates)son (Michael Shannon), and he is a certified mental patient. Not being able to find the love that once was pales to life-changing tragedy. Be aware of the possibility of a tear or two and the unraveling of your last nerve. This is not the happiest movie of the year.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Good (but not original) premise devolves into melodrama,10/6/2019,r0cko723,8-六月-09,"I was with this one through a good third of the film or so -- maybe even half. I'm a sucker for existential stories -- you know, stories in which one or more characters take a time-out from the sequence of events that inform and rule our daily lives and stop to consider the end game. Mendes was gold with ""American Beauty."" Well, I think he went to the well a few too many times with ""Revolutionary Road."" Yeah, it's another road. ""Road to Perdition"" was a road, too. Having gone down the road to perdition, did I need to take a re-run with another unhappy story in another time and setting? Not sure. Maybe. I appreciate Sam's move to bring it home (or at least a little closer) to something the average suburbanite could relate to. But the themes in Revolutionary Road have already been run through the grinder, and much more eloquently and effectively, by a writer named John Cheever. Sure, he worked in a different medium -- fiction on the page vs. cellulose -- but he got it right on the suburban malaise meter. He could have a crazy man come to an Episcopal church to crucify a rebellious teenager for the sins of the father: namely, conformity to prepackaged standards and adherence to values that seem obviously pointless. But still, when I watched the last half hour of "" . . . Road,"" I just wasn't buying it. The flick asks us to buy into the proposition that everyone deep down knows the sick deal we've all been dealt and everyone is really, really torn up about it but almost everyone represses that understanding or whatever -- and that the unfortunate courageous few, very few, who take a look at the parameters of the human condition head-on are bound either to cower down and put on the plastic mask or are doomed to freak the heck out. Sorry, but that's ridiculous. You can take a trip to your local poor part of town (like where I've lived most of my life) and, if you have a few minutes to chat with the locals and don't get your asterisk kicked in the process, you'll find that our world is full of people who understand that the bill of goods we've been sold from day one is a piece of fecal matter. They don't go around freaking out. Newsflash -- existential despair isn't a novelty. Plenty of us have it. We don't go daydreaming about running off to Paris because of it.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Formulas for Happiness and why they Crumble,10/10/2019,gradyharp,7-六月-09,"A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one. Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors. All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true.

Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future. Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group. From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage. The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble.

Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film. The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise. Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable. This is a sad story that has no redeeming end. Well worth the attention it has received. Grady Harp",pos
Revolutionary Road,Two Hours I'll Never Get Back,10/2/2019,happy_bunny721,4-六月-09,"I was very excited to see this film for months. It didn't play by my area, which was a bit upsetting. Luckily, I received it through Netflix the day after it came out on DVD. Now, I regret adding it to my list.

I'm going to start of by saying that DiCaprio and Winslet are terrific actors with a lot of potential and talent. Unfortunately, they didn't show this with this film. Every or most scenes they had together were nothing but screaming matches that made me cringe. The most upsetting part was that neither character had no character development. None whatsoever. Winslet as a housewife...boring. DiCaprio as a man who provides for his family with a job he loathes...boring. The screenplay could have easily made these typical cookie cutter roles into something new and refreshing. But they didn't.

Adding Kathy Bates to the film didn't do much either (and I think she's a great actress too). Was she there to turn the viewers' attention away from the main characters? If so, it was pointless as her being there. Michael Shannon plays one of the most boring and typical insane character I have ever seen. Yet another pointless character to distract the viewers. But somehow, he got an Oscar nomination for it (which should have went to Ralph Fiennes in ""The Duchess"", IMO).

I gave this film 2 stars instead of one because I think Sam Mendes did a good job with directing. The art direction was good as well.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Something's missing,10/7/2019,silmaril-6,16-五月-09,"I really admire Winslet and DiCaprio as actors. They're both fabulous in every their role and they had wonderful chemistry in Titanic (which my friend literally forced me to watch:-) They were great then and they are even greater now, but something's missing. I don't know what – storyline is good, Sam Mendes is great director (although I doubt he'll ever make better movie than American beauty), Kate and Leo were spectacular, but... I wasn't fully satisfied with the final result. I don't mind it's slow and I don't think it's boring like most of the people with negative reviews. Let me say that I've watched Taking Chance the same day (and this is the definition of slow paced movie and most people comment that it's boring because nothing happens from the beginning to the end), but this one grabbed my attention and my heart, although I can hardly (if ever) relate to it's subject. RR has a subject I can relate (although not from personal experience) but I didn't felt sucked in... Kate 10, Leo 10, Mendes 9, Revolutionary road 6,5

Revolutionary Road,"thoughtful, intense, lucid, superbly acted",10/9/2019,yris2002,29-三月-09,"The movie is about conflicts inside marriage, about the illusions and disillusions marriage brings about, as often, in any time, but I think Revolutionary Road is much more deeper, as it penetrates into the conflicts inside human nature itself. April and Frank, after seven years of apparently happy shared life, have to come to terms not only with the real quality of their marriage, but with their personal and individual sense of frustration, being Frank a thirty-year old man, a husband and a father, who still hasn't found out what his real passion is and proves to be weak and immature, April having abandoned all her dreams to become an actress and feeling entrapped in her own perfect house. Thus becomes marriage a sort of comfortable, although painful, alibi, which allows both of them to find a reason for individual dissatisfaction outside themselves, shifting the real reasons from their inner self to some external circumstance in their life, in this case marriage lived as a burden. As a woman, I saw the whole story through April's eyes: her exterior coldness and self-control hide such terrifying anxiety and depression, overcoming her till the final choice of committing suicide. I think that her condition is still more difficult than Frank's, given her troubled and painful relation to maternity, a very delicate theme handled in the movie: when maternity is lived as a moral duty, as a solution to individual and marital conflicts, the woman is the one in the couple who suffers this condition more deeply than man, since she is torn by the love she ""must"" feel for the creatures she has born and the reluctance towards the condition of being a mother when she didn't feel like to, simply because not every woman is to be a mother. Wonderful acting is offered, I would say as usual, by Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, capable of conveying true emotion, but also the whole cast deliver outstanding performances. Particularly striking is Michael Shannon playing Shep Campbell's role: he reminds me of a ""Shakesperean fool"", who, relying more or less uncounsciously on his mental disorder, conveys explicit but terrible explanation for Frank's and April's condition of weakness and hypocrisy, directly in front of them, a sort of inner voice of their conscience who dares say explicitly the sense of death stirring inside their family and their lives. I think the movie is absolutely worth seeing, because it gets to the real core of human nature, in a direct, intense, and extraordinarily lucid way: a movie that must make everyone think, since it confronts many questions concerning not only marriage but the complexity of human nature, with which every human being, now and then, consciously or uncounsciously, sooner or later, has to come to terms, and the result of this confrontation is, as often real life shows, not always soothing and positive.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Wow...,10/10/2019,daugaard4-1,19-三月-09,"When I first heard of the film I was told to await one of the best female performances ever seen, so my expectations for Kate Winslet were, of course, enormous. But after the film had ended I was in awe, she out blew my expectations! and that is, for me, very very rare. What makes this film so fantastic is the details and the acting, which I have never seen so sincere in my life. Mendes must be given huge credit for letting the development of the characters happen in a continuous way, so that you never lose faith in your characters. His many descriptions of norms of society and the ways of implementing them in the movie are amazing as well. Truly one of the best directed films I've seen. The film represents themes seen in every day life and is timeless in its actuality. Anyone who has ever stopped to think about the life they are living and planning to live MUST see this film.

Revolutionary Road,Brilliant Leo and Kate!,10/10/2019,toxic_vera,11-三月-09,"this movie is so far the best I've seen in recent years. leo dicaprio left me dumbfounded with his performance. I've been a leo fan way before and with this film he has shown once again how brilliant an actor he is. kate winslet is equally amazing. their chemistry in this film is astounding and i am really wanting for more. even the minor casts are good.

revolutionary road is indeed heart breaking and watching that final scene left me screaming inside my head the words leo screamed to kate in titanic.... ""youre so stupid april, why did you do that huh? why?""

what i like about this is the feeling of being transported back to the American suburban in the 50's and left the theater feeling light and nostalgic at the same time... you get a piece of what life was like back then.

watching this film crushed my heart but i will definitely watch it again.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Well acted, but hollow and derivative",10/6/2019,blackburnj-1,20-二月-09,"Sam Mendes's first two films (""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"") are two of the great American movies of the last ten years or so. The films, which examine, with great flair, the hollowness of the American Dream (though the latter has this in the background), have a new companion piece in the form of ""Revolutionary Road"". However, although Mendes is on familiar territory here, he doesn't manage to get anywhere close to the power of those films.

The film's story is familiar. 1950s suburban Americana turns into a living hell for a young bohemian couple. In short, it is something like an extended episode of ""Mad Men"". However, the driving idea behind the film is that this couple is trying to escape from their hell, rediscover the romance of their lives and flee to Paris. It is no coincidence then that Mendes has decided to reunite Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since they played the star crossed lovers in Titanic who embodied romance and the American dream.

The thing is that the casting is the most interesting thing in the film and that wears off rather quickly. The same old tired clichés are rolled out. The yearning neighbourly lust, the affair with the secretary and so on have all been seen before and nothing new is added. A few years back, Todd Haynes provided a far more effective and interesting piece in the form of ""Far From Heaven"" which examined the great prejudices and falsehoods that the fifties had wrapped up in them.

There are plus points. Winslet is fantastic, and should have been nominated for this rather than for ""The Reader"". DiCaprio is not as good as he has been, but Michael Shannon delivers a fantastic turn in the rather stereotypical role of the crazy man who sees past the charade. It is also stylishly shot (yet more excellent work from cameraman Roger Deakins) and looks very good.

However, it simply lacks a crucial element. It is very difficult to care for these characters. They always remain distant. Perhaps that is intended, but if so it is an error, because as the story unfurls in a predictable manner it becomes harder and harder to engage with them.",neg
Revolutionary Road,what a movie.,10/10/2019,daeng9-1,10-二月-09,"One of the most impressive movies in recent years including 'Dark Knight', 'No country for old men'. I was really really impressed by great acting from all the characters in this movie, especially Kate, Leo. So let me ask you. Is there any sign that winslet is suffering from any psychological disorder in real life these days? Her acting in the movie 'The Reader' is somewhat similar to that in this movie 'Revolutionary Road'. And both of them which Kate performed are about some psychologically ill character. rather silly question but I cannot fully express her great acting skills other than this way.. must see movie

Revolutionary Road,Uneven melodrama with terrific performances.,10/7/2019,Panterken,29-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road features such astonishing acting that you almost forget to keep your critical eye focused on the film as a whole. I have to begrudgingly conclude that Mendes' work fails to break a whole lot of new ground.

The comparison with American Beauty isn't completely fair since there's a fifty year gap between both, that's especially important for the concept of ""the American dream"" and the role of women in society. April's ache stems partly from her obligation to be a housewife. ""The American dream"" in the 1950's seems to consist mainly of martini lunches, monkey suits and ""darling"" houses on wide avenues. In American Beauty, the same goes for Carolyn's version, but Lester considers juvenile values holy, the laws of rebellion, freedom, rock'n'roll and recreational drugs.

Both of Mendes' films are poignant but unquestionably Revolutionary Road isn't half as relevant as American Beauty. Mendes' work isn't diminishing in quality, but it is stagnating. RR definitely outranks the passable Road To Perdition but never outclasses American Beauty, except maybe for the astonishing confrontation where Di Caprio's freak out made my heart stop for about half a minute. I believe it's only fair to hold every new film up to the light of an artist's best work. He does seem very skilled at bringing out the very best out of his cast, Di Caprio, Shannon and foremost Winslet impress . Especially the scenes where she lashes out at Frank are great, those wide, ruthless eyes are really against her natural acting style of more warm, genial characters.

The scenes with John Givings were subtle (and welcome) comic relief from the constant tension between the couple, and his observations helped the audience understand the relationship better. The dialog did well in cutting to the chase without being too theatrical. David Harbour performed admirably but neither his side character nor any of the others worked for me. They're purposely over the top and clichéd, which worked much better in the black comedy of American Beauty then it does in this serious drama.

Another problem for me: the lack of ambiguity. I realize April has an unstable nature, but she is by no means bipolar. She was right in all arguments, though her obvious flaw is the cowardice of avoiding confrontation( which destroys a marriage in the long run). I suspect the film's intention was to spark dialog, as in: some agree with Frank, others with April. I did not feel it reached that goal at all. For a movie dealing with such a poignant moral problem, it should have been less black and white. The plot was by no means completely predictable, but I knew from the instant they talked about going to Paris that he would get an opportunity at work and that she would get pregnant. I wouldn't dare claim I guessed how the third act would play out, I'll be honest, that shocked me.

The characters were so unlikeable, it felt like watching a Neil LaBute movie sometimes. April had some admirable qualities but I only felt sorry for Frank and the other characters caught in suburban hell. Maybe they should have granted us one or two scenes in between the meeting of Frank and April and the play, scenes of a happy marriage. I desperately wanted to empathize with the characters but had a hard time doing so. Another problem with the story for me, was the expected heavy drama at the end. The movie would have done just fine without the tacked on ending, cutting right after the breakfast scene.

All things considered, Revolutionary Road means a step in the right direction for director Mendes, and a confirmation of his exceptional talent, but it's not the timeless classic American Beauty is and I hope the director can live up to his dwarfing theatrical debut someday.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"Not as powerful as the book, but definitely worth seeing.",10/8/2019,bluebot,24-一月-09,"I read the novel by Richard Yates a little while ago, and I must say, Sam Mendes & Co., did an excellent job at paying an enormous tribute to this American masterpiece.

I think Mr. Yates would've been very proud, even if much of the emotional wallop written so profoundly in the book, wasn't completely translated onto film. The novel left me gutted, raw, totally blown away by its shocking intensity and excruciating truths. I felt almost the same way after watching this incredible film, however, the experience wasn't nearly as visceral for me. But then, books have a way of gripping our senses much more palpably than cinema at times.

This film was superbly acted. I cannot overstate this enough. However, the pace of the film left me feeling like I was reading ""cliff notes"" of the novel. Like we were given only a skeleton of Yates' fleshy, meaty, gut-wrenching tale of 1950's suburbia.

Kate and Leo are very much at the top of their game here. The fact that neither one of them got an Oscar nom for their respective roles in this heartrending film leaves me profoundly perplexed. They both acted their butts off! I am pleased that Michael Shannon got a nom for his amazing contribution, but the sheer audacious exclusion of a Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress nomination leaves me fuming. The Academy needs to seriously (and quickly) buy a vowel.

The novel stands the test of time. It is remarkable. A literary masterpiece in every single way. It's amazing how Mr. Yates' words continue to reverberate after all this time, and I'm certain he would have been very, very pleased with the powerful resonance of this film.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Mainstream cinema with a touch of existential agony,10/8/2019,kos-27,24-一月-09,"It makes me sad when a movie had the potential to be outstanding but only turns out OK. I was looking forward to this movie because I loved the novel. It had everything: a good story (the most important element), a good director, talented actors. Yet still the result didn't reach the books complexity, intensity and subtlety.

Why is that? I think it's not enough just to take the written dialogs and put them 1:1 into the movie. The written material should have been better elaborated to visualize the depth of the agony. Too many times words were chosen instead of other visual means - or just silence. Sometimes less is more. If you compare it to The Hours (the middle story with Julianne Moore) you see how the characters are better expressed in a shorter time frame and in a more subtle way.  

I liked more the first part of the movie that nicely built up the tension and set the stage. The second part, the final exchange of blows reminded me more of a boxing match (with words and punches) than of a subtle existential denouement.  

The actors  were good, but not great. I liked Di Caprio's performance almost more than Winslet's, but neither of them could truly reveal the deepest secrets and fears of of Frank and April Wheeler. Sadly the result was too superficial, too conventional in its dramatic outline without any risk taken- almost too flawless.  

It should be seen as an elegant and fairly successful piece of mainstream cinema whose main credit is to to give viewers something to think about and as an impulse for the brilliant novel to be read again.

Not bad but not strong enough.  ",pos
Revolutionary Road,An absolute masterpiece.,10/10/2019,dead47548,24-一月-09,"Sam Mendes' masterpiece Revolutionary Road doesn't take any time to introduce us to it's characters or show us how they met and fell in love. From the very first scene, we know who Frank and April Wheeler are and why they are so tragically unhappy. The Wheelers thought that they were special, somehow superior to the drones of classic suburban America that they began living among. Perhaps it was the realization that they were living such a dull, unimpressive life that made them feel superior, but in the opening stages of the film they slowly realize that they have stopped being outsiders and instead have become just another uninteresting couple in this uninteresting world. To open themselves back up to life and that superiority, April creates a dream fantasy to move to Paris and they both buy into it for as long as they can.

This dream of Paris, however, is just a band-aid for a wound that won't stop bleeding. For a little while they live on a high, basking in the glow that this fantasy has brought them. But soon they realize that they can never escape this disaster of an existence that they accidentally slipped into too long ago for them to even remember what made them so interesting in the first place. Their despondency with life quickly turns into aggressive hatred towards each other as they fall further and further apart in a series of brutal arguments that only get worse and worse. The tragedy of this film, and these characters, is that in the end they don't hate each other. Frank and April Wheeler love each other deeply, but that love is so strong that the only way to distract themselves from a life they never dreamed of living is to turn such a strong emotion into unimaginable hatred towards each other. They are in love and want to be happy together, but everything in their lives succeeds in driving them further and further apart into an ending that shook me to the core.

Of course, when it comes down to it, this tragic tale of suburban misery is an actor's showcase. And boy, what a showcase it is. I've seen a few people express hate for the film and it's performances because they feel that it was all too melodramatic and scenery chewing. But I personally think that's the genius behind these performances. Not because the actors are melodramatic, but because the characters themselves make their own arguments melodramatic and explosive just so that they can feel something. These people are craving for something that they can never have, a kind of life you would see in the movies. And if they can't have a happy life where they travel around Paris having fun, they can at least feel alive in the most tragic way possible by taking out their aggression on each other at every turn. All of the shouting and flailing of the arms, I think that was all in the realism of the characters and their need to shout louder and be more theatric than the other person. They used this explosiveness to establish dominance in the argument and relationship and in that respect, the performances were flawless.

Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me a few times this decade, but his performance in this picture makes his past work look like child's play. Hell, he makes the rest of the actors in this piece seem like amateurs. He steals every second of this film with an explosive, emotionally powerful performance that served to devastate, terrify and move me all at the same time. A brutal portrayal of an ultimately sympathetic and tragic character and without a doubt one of the best performances of the year. Even though DiCaprio completely steals the film, that's not to say that the rest of the performances are anything but sensational. Kate Winslet is the perfect match for his talent in the arguments of these characters and each of them provide their own level of internal fear and external explosiveness. Michael Shannon has been an actor who I've admired quite a bit over the past few years, stealing scenes in all of his films while he went unnoticed and underrated by the world at large. Needless to say, when I found out that he had a performance with Oscar buzz in a prestige picture like this (a performance that would eventually earn him an actual Oscar nomination), my expectations were pretty high off the bat. He took those expectations, ran with them, and then shattered anything I could have expected from him. His performance is absolutely frightening and I couldn't be more pleased that his talent is getting recognized all over the place, especially by the Academy themselves. His explosive argument with DiCaprio's character unsettled me in a way that few films ever have, and that was based entirely on the flawless performances from the two actors.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Intense psychological drama,10/10/2019,j-ward,18-一月-09,"This movie is incredible. It is much a cross between Labute's ""In the Company of Men"" and Mamet's ""Oleana"". If you are a fan of either of these movies you will likely love this movie. However, if, like most others, you haven't seen either of them then ask yourself if your idea of a good time is watching two intelligent people in a state of existential dread over the meaninglessness and routine nature of life rip either other apart verbally in the fashion of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"". If not, avoid this film.

Like DiCaprio's early work with DeNiro in ""This Boy's Life"" this film is all about an intellectuals struggle to find his voice to carve out a life, to follow his dreams, or to give up and accept the forces that, Mendes' so vividly relates, tend to move us to obscurity and mediocrity. Namely waking up to a life in a job you hate, with 2.3 kids and living in suburbia filled with routine drudgery and your typical 50's June Cleaver types as neighbors. It is depressing. It is painful to watch. Yet it says so much about the daily grind that so many of us go through. We run the rat race, move up the ladder... but for what?? To one day find out that all our childhood dreams are only that... dreams that have faded away with the new day.

Without giving away details about this movie, let me just say it is like a couple on the brink of divorce going to see a world renown therapist. Once in the office, the man relates an intricate story to the therapist detailing all his wife's failings. The therapist nods and agrees and the man feels validated. Then the wife takes the floor detailing all the ways her husband has let her down. Again the therapist nods and agrees with all her points. At this the man jumps in and says... ""You said I was right... Now you are saying my wife is right. We can't both be right."" Again the therapist nods and agrees.

Similarly, this movie is all about the delicate nature of truth. Some of us devote our live's to it. Other's dummy ourselves down in order to live in peace with those close to us. We tell little white lies to protect those we love... but lies build and soon we are lying to ourselves and have lost our moral compass. Some of us are so devoted to our version of the truth that we seem crazy and are committed to a mental hospital... but truly there is a thin line between genius and insanity and this movie all takes place along that line.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Well acted and made, but it's really just a turgid melodrama",10/7/2019,zetes,11-一月-09,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in this film about an unhappily married couple. When they met, they were idealistic youths, but when they arrive in the suburbs, he working in sales and she a housewife, life seems dreary. The film offers no new insights on marriage or life. It is set in the 1950s, so you might think it's like, say, Far from Heaven in that it attempts to exploit the inadequacies of an era so beloved by a certain group of our society. But, no, Revolutionary Road doesn't make much of its '50s setting. I think it wants to be more universally about marriage. It's set in the '50s, I think, so there's a better reason these two people who just plain dislike each other have to stay together. So, taking place in the 1950s actually dates the problems that these couple are having for the most part. The story just doesn't feel relevant to a modern audience. Or me, at least. The film isn't that bad in the end. The acting is quite good, especially from Kate Winslet. Though I am a big fan of Michael Shannon, I found his two scenes in the movie very poorly written, mostly concerning his character, who comes off as a mere plot tool rather than a real person. The film is very gorgeous to look at, thanks to Roger Deakins, and I liked Thomas Newton's score (he provided an even better one for Wall-E earlier in 2008).",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Overall, this was a depressing and disappointing movie that had nothing new to say",10/2/2019,stareeswan,2-三月-17,"I expected a good movie. The lead actors are well known and normally good at what they do, as is the director. How disappointing then, to discover that this combination resulted in a monumental failure to connect.

Tolstoy said that ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way"" and I was willing to explore that premise in this movie. But it's difficult to care about characters that are so two dimensional. As the movie ended, I still felt that I barely knew the people in it.

There was no real storytelling here. There was literally no story. Just an unhappy couple lurching from one fight to the next throughout the entire movie. They are both unfaithful, immature and behave irrationally. Unfortunately, neither of them is likable or sympathetic. The R rating of the movie is justified by the frequent profanity, several sex scenes and the inevitable (by which I mean; you could see it coming a mile off), self-administered abortion.

April (Winslet) seems almost bipolar with her constant changes of mood, swinging from calm and loved-up to full-on screaming hate, at head spinning speed. Her solution to fix this mutual unhappiness, is for them all to relocate to Paris. But she'd forgotten the most important fact, that wherever you go, you take yourself with you. Sometimes it's not external factors that make you unhappy (or happy) it is what is within you. Eh. So she has a lackluster quickie with the neighbor (who is madly in love with her - poor bastard)

Frank (DiCaprio) is also clearly dissatisfied with his life, experiments with infidelity and is still no happier. After some persuasion, he goes along with April's crazy idea and there is a brief honeymoon period while they put together their plans for the move. But it all quickly falls apart again and their screaming matches resume.

The most interesting character was the man from the asylum. At least he said what he thought, not what people wanted to hear.

For me, the most disturbing aspect of this movie was something that seems all too familiar, a husband deciding for his wife that they should have a baby, when she clearly doesn't want one. I know, times and (men's) attitudes were different back then but the end result was not thus surprising. Frank deliberately waits until the last day of her 12 week of pregnancy has passed before he tells April he didn't even want the baby either.. when it is now too late to safely do anything about it. Nice. What was a woman to do then, if she didn't want the child she was carrying? Choices were limited and the risks very high. But women have always, and will always, try to make those choices for themselves, whether men want them to or not. I'd like to think some of the sadness he shows later, is because of those choices he made. But probably not.

The scene near the end, with April acting all ""Stepford wife"" preparing breakfast the morning after another terrible fight.. now *that* was really creepy. I was expecting her to have poisoned the food, or to suddenly get out a big knife and start stabbing Frank.. anything other than just sending hubby off to work with a wave. Then I thought, well maybe she's going to hop off to Paris (on her own or with the kids) that would have been perfect. that would have been a good conclusion to the movie, not a ""happy"" ending as such but still.. Go live the life you want lady! But no.

Overall this was a depressing and disappointing movie that had nothing new to say about unhappy families, the human condition or anything else for that matter. Two wasted hours.",neg
Revolutionary Road,well made BUT not very believable,10/6/2019,jaybob,3-六月-09,"Revolutionary Road was directed by Sam Mendes from a screenplay by Justin Haythe,& from the novel by Richard Yates. Time period is 1950's. Its about suburban life & the unhappy marriage of 2 attractive people with 2 attractive children.

Leonrdo Dicaprio & Kate Winslet portray this unhappy couple.

A BIT OF personal history here. In the 1950's I was just a few years younger than this couple & also lived in a middle size city.

I cannot remember any persons in my age group back then acting like this couple did. Granted some did not have happy lives BUT none were this miserable. I remember that era as being a glorious time to live & raise a family..

Yes we smoked & drank a lot BUT not to the extent this couple did.

In the film Micheal Shannon plays a neighbours adult son, just released from a mental hospital. To me he was the sanest person in the cast,He just was ahead of his time speaking out on subjects.

The acting by Kate & Leo is good. They just were not a likable couple especially Kate Winslet's April. She was a selfish, controlling b****, What she does at conclusion, made me lose whatever remaining respect I may have had for. Leonardo Dicaprio's, Frank, also was not someone I would have wanted as a friend, I would even have trouble consoling him at the end of the film.

Now for what I did like in the film. they did recreate the period as far as settings, costumes etc. Aside from Micheal Shannon's performance, I must comment Zoe Kazan (Elia Kazan's granddaughter) he is the young secretary that Frank has an affair with. There were so many cigarettes consumed,I hope no one gets sick from watching the movie.

Revolutionary Road,Gripping drama of dysfunctional family life.,10/9/2019,sonya90028,16-二月-09,"Revolutionary Road, is a drama centered around the lives of a young suburban couple, in the 1950s. Frank Wheeler and his wife April, have been living out the American dream, as proscribed by 1950s social expectations. Frank has a decent job as an executive, which has allowed him to comfortably support his wife and two children.

There's trouble in paradise though, when April urges Frank to quit his job, which he hates, and move the family to Paris. Once in Paris, April wants to work at a high-paying administrative job, for the Parisian government. She is willing to support the family herself, while Frank takes time off to 'find himself'.

Skeptical at first, Frank warms-up to April's plan. But after being offered a lucrative promotion at his company, Frank becomes conflicted about moving away to Paris. Meanwhile, April admits to Frank that she no longer loves him. All emotional hell breaks loose in their marriage, as Frank confesses to having a fling with his secretary. And April then has a brief tryst with her neighbor's spouse, in their car one evening.

Things are further complicated in Frank and April's relationship, when April becomes unexpectedly pregnant with their third child. Feeling stifled and trapped as Frank's wife, April doesn't want the baby. And she's willing to take desperate measures, to end her pregnancy. As their marriage completely unravels, Frank and April come to realize the terrible compromises that they've both made, in order to conform to the absurd expectations of American life in the 1950s.

Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both well-matched as the stars of this movie. Leo radiates a compelling charisma, as Frank Wheeler. Leo makes the viewer believe that Frank Wheeler should be destined for better things, than his mundane work-a-day life. Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, does manage to outdo Leo's performance. Kate emotes with a skilled precision, giving enough of herself in each scene to be believable, without going overboard.

The supporting cast of this film, turns-in decent performances. Especially Kathy Bates as the Wheeler's simpering neighbor, Helen Givings. And Michael Shannon gives a standout performance, as Helen's son John, who endured brutal, and unnecessary psychiatric 'treatments'.

Revolutionary Road gives viewers a glimpse into the ridiculous, oppressive existence of '50s suburbanites, and the gruesome effects that it had on their lives. After watching this film, all I can say is how thankful I am for the 60s!",pos
Revolutionary Road,The truth about Marriage,10/9/2019,slackjaw79,27-一月-09,"Anyone who has ever been married knows exactly what this couple is going through. Some spouses won't actually vocalize their disagreements in the same way, but they'll feel it. The main characters are faced with a crisis when they realize that their lives haven't turned out the way they had hoped. They got married, had kids, and were forced to make sacrifices. The husband found a job that's unfulfilling. The wife had hopes for something better than suburbia. But, now they are both trapped because of their responsibilities.

SPOILER: The wife hatches a plan that will free her and her family from this trap. But, circumstances make their plans impossible to accomplish and their hope for a better life dissolves. While the husband is willing to deal with the changes, the wife is devastated and takes her own life.

This isn't the only marriage with problems. In fact, in their circle of friends, they stood out as an example of a great marriage. They were supposed to be the best. But the higher you are on the social ladder, the farther you fall.

The real message of the movie is that marriage is a trap. I didn't really understand this until one of the last scenes where we see the interaction between Kathy Bates and her husband. The only point of the scene seems to be that every marriage has problems. Every marriage is miserable. The higher you are and the greater your expectations of married life, the harder you will crash.

I don't agree with this message, but the movie was a good portrait of what every marriage is like. There are other answers to these problems besides moving to Paris.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Depressing and Inspiring,10/9/2019,marius1915,27-一月-09,"This is one of the saddest films I've ever seen in my life (Sophie's Choice wins), but I'm so glad I saw it, because it changed my life or the way my life is going to be.

The film is about a young married couple,Frank and April Wheeler, who are ready to make their first step to change the world, by moving into Revolutionary road, where nothing ever changes, where time stops and where people get stuck. It's not long before Frank and April both become aware of their situation and try everything society allows them to escape it. In the end they both realize, like everyone else they're stuck. They're arrogance causes them to completely break down into the tragic life that they always thought they were too smart for.

Kate and Leo are amazing in this film, they balance each other out like a real- life married couple, when the one is weak the other one is strong. The intense emotion that come through the dialog between them is enough to kill your life. I would recommend this to any body who prefers the smarter films in life.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Unhappy Marriage: The Movie,10/6/2019,Pierre_Kirby,26-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road is Sam Mendes fourth (or fifth?) film, and as you can expect, the film looks visually exquisite. But I'm not going to start talking about cinematography here. I'm going to start talking about how Revolutionary Road is Sam's weakest film. The praise and hate the movie is receiving puzzles me. For starters, Revolutionary Road is a movie that depends on performances, not story or script; What you mostly see for almost 2 hours is two good looking people duking it out over their unhappiness, their wasted lives, their BORING lives, the chances they missed and wished they had, etcetera, etcetera. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but that doesn't mean that you have to 'get' the movie in order to hype it up for everyone else. As I said, the movie is about performances, nothing more, nothing less.

Two young people fall in love one night, get married, have children, and start to question if they really love each other. The premise of Revolutionary Road is based on a novel that I have no intention of reading, let alone comparing to the movie. Between infidelities and broken dreams, it is all about the 'realistic' aspect of the marriage between Leo and Kate, which is why I guess many people love this one. On the other hand, we have the requisite over-blown dramatic sequences which apparently turned off most of the professional critics and commenter's here in IMDb. I am in the middle.

I appreciate Sam's extreme attention and detail to the ups and downs of marriage, but what I don't appreciate is the little things in between. For some reason, we have Michael Shannon telling Leo and Kate the reality of the situation IN THEIR FACE, in order for them to understand what is really going on. Then we have an unnecessary love issue between the Wheeler's neighbor with Kate that goes on as subtle as Pink Floyd giving a free concert in Times Square. And an ending that teaches us that marriage is not what the magazines make you believe it is. Or the American Dream ads for that matter. After Jarhead, I really don't understand why Sam wanted to tackle this project in the first place. The script is incredibly simple, and it isn't as great as many people here are making you believe it is. What enhances the script, and the movie, are the performances, which are first-rate. I hate repeating myself, but it is the case I'm afraid.

Kate Winslet is the talk of town this year, and I can see why, at least in this movie. Her performance as bored and depressed April Wheeler is fantastic on almost all accounts. But as fantastic as Kate was, it was Leo who definitely made me turn my head. He completely stole Kate's thunder, COMPLETELY. And in Leo's quieter moments is where he shines the most. Why the hell did he get snubbed? What the hell are the Academy smoking? I mean, is it really that hard to nominate a great performance? Jeez. The supporting cast is forgettable except for of course Michael Shannon. Out of the four scenes he was in, he stole all four of them. Who the hell is Michael Shannon? Quite possibly one of the most underrated actors working today, who alongside Ryan Gosling will definitely go places in the near future. Thank the gods he has a much deserved nomination.

Revolutionary Road is like some of the movies released this year (Gran Torino, Seven Pounds)- loved by many people, hated by many critics. As a big fan of Sam Mendes, this was sort of let down. The script wasn't anything special, and the movie is basically there for you to see Leo, Kate's and Shannon's performances, which is alright I guess. Far from being a bad movie, but it is also far from being a masterpiece. It is just an above-average watch that you will either love or hate.

Revolutionary Road,Mendes mending more marriage hearts but with a slick revolutionary style!,10/8/2019,meeza,17-一月-09,"Director Sam Mendes' suburbia melancholy tic is still ticking with his latest subversive (synonym of revolutionary) film ""Revolutionary Road"". The film is not really a revolutionist one as it is a sinister one; sinister in the sense of marriage peccadillo. Mendes brings us the usual no-no's of marriage that have been mores in the matrimony world in the last few decades: adultery, deceit, lies, dissatisfaction, and escapism. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Frank & April Wheeler, a young married couple with two kids living in a Connecticut suburb in the mid 1950's. Frank Wheeler unenthusiastically just goes with the motion in his mundane office job living paycheck by paycheck. April Wheeler is a stay-at-home mom and part-time amateur actress who longs for more than the life she is living. Therefore, a Wheeler Revolution must occur! So they decide to move to Paris. They inform their archetypal suburban married neighbors (and best friends) Shep and Milly Campbell of their Tour de France plans; The Campbells think it is all talk soup, even with their stunned expressions. That scene is probably the elite one the film. The Wheeler's revolutionary Paris road plans come to a dead end when Frank gets an unexpected promotion and the zenith of the Wheeler Marriage Civil War begins. ""Revolutionary Road"" should not be part of an itinerary for a Marriage Retreat because most of the film shows the Wheelers emotionally bickering about various contrived sentiments and psychological conflicts. DiCaprio and Winslet's titanic performances are Oscar worthy; but Winslet wins out between the two. Nevertheless, my favorite performance of the film was Michael Shannon's scene-stealing work as John Gibins, the mentally troubled son of the Wheeler's real estate confidante Helen Gibins. Shannon portrays John Gibins as a real straight shooter who fires emotional verbal blows to the Wheelers which get them off track in saving their marriage. I hope the Academy does shadow my Shannon sentiment by giving him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kathy Bates is ""gibin"" us some more fine acting in the twilight of her career with her solid work as Helen Gibins. Justin Haythe's screenplay based on Richard Yates ""Revolutionary Road"" novel gives the best-seller literary work a respectful proper credence. You gotta have Haythe in your promising screenwriter list. Roger Deakins' astounding cinematography should garner him yet another Oscar nomination; copy that Roger. But let's divert back to Sam the Man! Mendes, Mr. Kate Winslet himself, admirably continues to direct stories on marriage tribulations that cause eventual destruction on many psychological effects on a couple and those close around. He did it proficiently with ""American Beauty"" and does an encore with it in ""Revolutionary Road""; even though I thought Beauty was superior to Road. When you first cinematically drive through ""Revolutionary Road"" it seems like just a mediocre movie ride; but before you could say ""mental revolution"" it does linger in your mind for a few days and that is a prominent sign of a powerful film. Follow your movie G.P.S. and take a ride through ""Revolutionary Road"". **** Good",pos
Revolutionary Road,Powerhouse performances of Winslet and DiCaprio carry this painfully beautiful film to new level.,10/8/2019,bl2013,17-一月-09,"Walking into the theater to see ""Revolutionary Road"" with some friends of mine, I expected nothing more but a remarkable performance by long lost co-stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. I was given much, much more than I paid for. Although the film adaptation doesn't hold a candle to Yates' actually story telling, Winslet's and DiCaprio's exceptional portrayal of Frank and April Wheeler really take you straight to 115 Revolutionary Road and give you a front row seat to possibly one of the greatest screen performances of 2009

""Revolutionary Road"" is that kind of movie that not only teaches us a truth we don't want to believe but shoves it in your face all at the same time. It's very unfortunate that the film couldn't live up to the novel it was based on, but it came very, very close. The script, flawed as it is does give its main characters a certain life to them that draws its audience in, but soon once an audience member accepts the invitation they don't want to stay because of what they see; the truth. Despite the very familiar premise of the story, ""Revolutionary Road"" does what most martial dramas aren't anymore; they make the audience leave the theater with a lesson learned. Mendes makes you really question the assumed sophisticated living of fifties suburban life.

Simply put, DiCaprio and Winslet carried this movie all on their own. This being the first movie they've worked on together since ""Titanic"", I came with high hopes but also some doubts. I felt that their performance in this movie wouldn't even come close to falcon punch of a performance in Titanic. I have no hesitation to say that their work in this film surpassed their performance in Titanic in all aspects. The chemistry they established in Titanic really was shown in this film. Even as their characters hated each other, you felt the heat of passion that radiated from their scene work. Also, I tip my hat to the surprising performance of Michael Shannon portraying the clinically disturbed ""John Givings"". He really did justice to the part he was given; I was utterly convinced by his performance. I think it's safe to say that the cast of this movie is what brought to the level it's on.

This is not a film for the whole family, but this a film that should be seen nonetheless. Don't go to this movie with fascination of a story in mind, come for a soon-to-be classic performance of two incredible artists.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Brooding with intelligence and thoughtfulness,10/7/2019,EijnarAmadeus,17-一月-09,"Sam Mendes' fourth feature in ten years is a harsh and thoughtful look at Richard Yates classic-novel with the same name. It stars Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since 1997's Titanic, though anyone in hope of experiencing the epic love the two last performed on screen is in for a big lackluster, because this is a torn and frayed piece of love with tragic outcomes.

The directing of Mendes is likely 2008's best, he is with huge thought using his leading but also importantly supporting actors, to painfully reveal layers of emotions - and although there are few real close-ups, it gently but with firmness paces scenes that gives the audience time to linger and feel with them. The score of Thomas Newman is intense and goes deep into the soul of the characters, it tightens the screws of something that's already unbearable. Shot by master-cinematographer Roger Deakins the film glows in a palette of hard realism, but also the lyrical glare of the novel.

DiCaprio is truly turning into one of the finest in the acting elite, his incredible run of great performances the last few years is here again a proof of his maturing and fantastical acting-skills. Winslet has already anchored her Golden Globe, as she again showcases herself as one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Worth mentioning is also the terrific performances by the supporting cast; Kathy Bates (always great), and the neighbor-couple Milly and Shep (Kathryn Han and David Harbour) and off course Michael Shannon as John Givings, a retarded man who comes just in time to see behind the shades ""happiness"" in April and Frank Wheeler's ""special"" marriage.

REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is among 2008's best films and is a depressing look at life with a brooding reality that makes it a difficult and ponderous experience.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"A visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama",10/9/2019,Monotreme02,11-一月-09,"If one thing can be said about Mendes, it's that his career has been very eclectic: although all three of his previous movies have depicted distinctly American themes, each was in an entirely different genre and setting. With Revolutionary Road, Mendes comes full circle with his first film, American Beauty, and explores similar themes but with far more subtlety. It is this subtlety that I felt was eventually the film's biggest flaw, but we'll get to that later. Let's start with what was good, in the film, and that gives us a lot of ground to cover. As with his previous films, the production value is truly second to none. With the costume and set design, Mendes has managed to flawlessly capture Eisenhower-era American suburbia of the 1950's down to every little detail of the period. And second-time-collaborator Roger Deakins provides a startling, subtle-but-beautiful visual look for the film, perfectly capturing both the period and the contrast between its diffused, sunlit posterior to the stormy, tremulous interior of the lives of the protagonists.

The story itself is simple but allows for the profound, in-depth exploration of themes. While Mendes' previous films have appeared broad, well-known ensemble casts, with this film he goes a little subtler, and aside from his two main players the cast are mostly unknowns. That said, he was blessed with his two leads, who are two of the best actors working today and also two of my favourites: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who worked together for the first time over 10 years ago on Titanic, have proved that they have grown up significantly since the cruise liner disaster movie. Their performances are simply riveting, and they truly bring the fairly simple story of the film to life. While DiCaprio, an actor who has really been rising recently in terms of the quality of his projects and the range of his acting, delivers a striking, dramatic, visceral performance; and yet, distinction can be made that, in my opinion, Winslet out-acts DiCaprio: I haven't read the original novel but from the movie I got the impression that it was more about her than about him. So with Winslet taking center stage, she really delivers on a tremendous level. She nails everything from body language to subtle character quirks to the large, bombastic, dramatic fight scenes, and delivers a performance so poignant and resonant that one can't help but admire her. The thing with Winslet is that she does this with pretty much every role, which is why she is such a good actress in my opinion.

So what's the movie really about? Well, I saw it as an examination, a breakdown of the American Dream. The classic meaning of that term is divided into three major categories: liberty, prosperity and the pursuit of happiness. The film seems to shoot this very mythological idea of the American Dream down, and depicts a situation in which one category comes in stead of the other: in order to be free, we must release ourselves from the obligations of financial success. In order to be rich and prosperous, we must give up our freedoms and liberties in life. And happiness? I felt that the film dealt most with happiness, as both freedom and prosperity seem to contain a little bit each of that third category, but in both cases true, complete happiness seems to be a compromise in both cases. What is the meaning of happiness? Shouldn't two beautiful children, a large, cozy home and financial security also ensure happiness? Or must me always seek more from life? Both characters in the film are adulterous, but they also both find out that infidelity is not an effective escape from their unhappiness. One gets the impression, that even if the characters would end up moving to Paris, they would be unhappy there as well, and what fuels their temporary happiness seems to be the fantasy of getting away, and not the actual act.

With Revolutionary Road, his fourth film, Sam Mendes has crafted yet another visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama; the performances by DiCaprio and Winslet are simply phenomenal, and while the plot seems simple, it contains complex characters and explores deep, rich themes. Here within lies Revolutionary Road's biggest flaw: Mendes has explored these themes of the meaning of the American Dream before, in his debut film and the utter masterpiece American Beauty, and I felt that the former film explored these themes and delivered that message far more effectively than this latest one. Where Revolutionary Road was restrained and subtle, American Beauty went all-out and held nothing back. And it is this very repetition that restricted this film to being good but not the masterpiece I was hoping it to be.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road,10/10/2019,marycuevas,4-一月-09,"This film will resonate on many different levels with everyone who sees it. And I hope those who see it, who maybe loathe their husbands , like Kate Winslett's character does, have the courage and strength to run away as fast as they can. Do not settle for 2 or 3 martinis every night, or a trip to the jewelry store for another piece of bling, or a trip to a psychiatrist for happy pills, or empty meaningless affairs. Hit the road and run run run far far away.

The scene that is in all the trailers for the film showing April (Kate Winslett) taking out the trash reminded me of a story a friend of mine told me. I once asked this friend why she left her marriage.

She said, ""one morning I woke up and took the trash can out to the street. I looked down the street at all the other trash cans and homes with well-manicured lawns and realized at that moment this was not the life I wanted."" She left her husband and their mid-western life behind and moved to Laguna Beach, California. She never looked back.

Anyway, this movie had many Madame Bovary moments for me. The only difference is that April really loved Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) in the beginning. Another difference would be Emma Bovary's desire for a show house and show things to prove her worth in society. April does not seem to care about material things or the status quo, in fact she rebels against it.

Kathy Bates plays the real estate agent who sells the lovely home on Revolutionary Road to April and Frank. Her crazy son, with a PhD in mathematics, is the wisest man in the film. He sees right through the frustration in April's life.

Sam Mendes directs this film. He also directed American Beauty. An excellent choice since both show nightmare suburban lives. Different decades, but nightmares all the same.

Adapted for the screen by Justin Haythe from the book by Richard Yates. Kate Winslett and Leonardo Di Caprio give award winning performances. Kathy Bates is great as the real estate agent. Her crazy son John (Michael Shannon) is only on the screen for a short time,, but an award winning appearance in my humble opinion. This is the first time Kate Winslett has worked with her husband, Sam Mendes.

On a personal note, I came very close to a life like April's while I was living in New Zealand. My ex-fiancé is a wealthy real estate developer who owns half of downtown Wellington. I am so glad I had the strength to board that plane that flew me far far away and on to new beginnings.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Like a Tennessee Williams Play,10/4/2019,PenyZKad,24-八月-09,"What a terribly depressing story about people who have no idea about happiness. It really did remind me of a Tennessee Williams play. All the characters are hopeless. It all starts out so innocently. Frank and April Wheeler - a couple of dreamers who are going places. They have big plans. However life doesn't tend to follow road maps. They want so desperately to be happy, but it's just not meant to be. Just when they think they have the perfect solution to all their problems, Life steps in and messes it all up. Throw in a crazy acquaintance who sees things more clearly than the so-called sane characters in this drama, and you have the perfect tragedy. I just sat in stunned silence when it was over. All that was missing was the Southern accents.",pos
Revolutionary Road,What's the Point?,10/5/2019,zeedunn,25-七月-09,"I thought this movie should win the award for most depressing movie of the year. They could invent a new category with this film in mind. This movie is my worst nightmare come to life. Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) play a married couple in the 1950s. We understand that they are perfect for one another, but their marriage is horrible. They tear each other down and say awful things to one another. They are two wounded people bumping up against one another. They don't talk about these problems and instead focus on the surface problems. They have bought into the lie that ""this is as good as it gets."" One day, April decides that good enough isn't good enough and she wants a change. She decides she can find that life in Paris. If they would only move to Paris, then they would be happy. Frank agrees and then later changes his mind. They don't move to Paris and fight even more. The movie is this couple fighting the entire movie. Instead of talking to one another, they decide to have affairs to numb the pain of their lives. They tear each other apart until there is nothing left.

Now don't get me wrong, this is a well-made and interesting movie. I was riveted the whole time, and my heart was beating fast the entire film. I'm not really sure why that was. Needless to say, it was intense. The acting was superb. Forget about The Reader, Kate should have received an award for her performance here. The same goes for Leo. I love Leonardo DiCaprio, and I always will. I have loved him since he was a little squirt on Growing Pains. Both of these actors can show the torment they are feeling with one look. Then, effortlessly, they cover it up to hide their pain.

That would be enough, having two lead actors work this kind of magic, but the supporting cast is perfect as well. John (Michael Shannon) is perfect as a tortured mathematician whose had shock treatments. He is like an oracle who can only speak the truth, even though no one wants to hear it. There is never a dull dinner party when John is invited. The next door neighbors say much more when they are not speaking.

All that being said, what is the point of this movie? I am trying to imagine someone trying to spin this to a studio . . .

Storyboard guy: Okay, Joe, so there's this married couple, you see? And their both young and beautiful. They meet, get married, and they're miserable.

Joe: Mmm-hmmm.

Storyboard: One day they decide to move to Paris, but the husband, see, he changes his mind, and they don't move to Paris.

Joe: Mmm-hmmm Storyboard: Then they are still miserable, you see? Joe: Mmm-hmmm, but it ends okay, right? Storyboard: No, it gets worse.

Joe: Mmm-hmm. Well, I'm sold.

It's not a movie that will make you cry. You just feel empty, and wonder what the heck just happened.

What do we learn? Don't get married? Is the moral really you should have moved to Paris. Let's just get real here. It wouldn't matter if they lived in Paris or not. Neither one of them could admit their fears to one another. They never helped each to grow or took the time to reach out to one another. And that's the trap they couldn't escape, not suburban America.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Middle-class, suburban America seen as a creative and emotional dead-end...",10/5/2019,moonspinner55,25-一月-09,"Playing a business equipment salesman in the 1950s--a husband and father of two whose life has become a depressing rut--Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't quite have the chops here to portray angst successfully. The 30-year-old blues appear to have arrived too early for the actor (even Richard Burton had to wait a while before the marital blahs wore well on him). DiCaprio works commendably hard under Sam Mendes' direction, furrowing his brow and keeping his voice in a lower register, but he still looks like a kid in his suits and hats. Kate Winslet (reunited with DiCaprio after their successful pairing in 1997's ""Titanic"") plays his housewife-spouse, and looks terrific in her '50s wardrobe even if her character is almost impossible to reach (she's either too stony or too talkative). This prestigious-looking adaptation of Richard Yates' novel is rather like a Douglas Sirk melodrama with the central issue missing. It is purposefully glossy and plush, yet the argumentative digs and disappointments which crop up between this immature-acting couple are supposed to be far more edgy and provocative than those found in Sirk's potboilers. One might be forgiven for wondering what the hell is eating away at these two; opening with a fight scene in front of their car at night, I felt DiCaprio's Frank and Winslet's April were eons away from George and Martha of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Winslet simply cannot eke out a tangible character within this sterile format (one wants to like her April solely because Winslet looks so beautiful, but April has far less dimensions than most heroines). The husband's job, the couple's plans for the future, the neighbor next-door who harbors a secret crush on the unhappy Mrs., all contribute to making this portrait an interesting journey--but is it a worthwhile, moving experience? I don't believe so, not with these leads and not with Justin Haythe's callow screenplay. ""Revolutionary Road"" (terrible title!) promises to be a heady exercise; it has the impeccable production and slick sweep of a good commercial movie for grown-ups, but Mendes instead offers us selfish adult children and endless bickering. Give me Sirk any day. Three Oscar nominations: for Michael Shannon as Best Supporting Actor, Albert Wolsky for his costume design (deservedly so) and for art direction. ** from ****",pos
Revolutionary Road,An emotional and dramatic insight into the 'American dream',10/9/2019,Reel_starz,24-一月-09,"When I read the book last summer, I was mesmerized by Richard Yate's unsentimental, realistic portrayal of suburban life in the 1950s. He presented a young couple whose dreams of happiness and excitement are grounded by reality and responsibility. What is so unique about this story is the fact that the feelings that the couple (Frank and April Wheeler) experience could apply to anyone, no matter where or when you live. Unlike many stories set during this time period, Revolutionary Road is still relevant today.

All this is perfectly captured in Sam Mendes' startling adaptation. Like in American Beauty, he does a magnificent job of bringing out the emotions of the characters and conveying the hopelessness of their situation. The characters are all flawed in various ways, but Mendes effectively turns these flawed people into three-dimensional, realistic humans that we ultimately come to care about - at least that's how I felt. We can identify with their hopes, fears and desires and we understand what feelings motivate them to take make sometimes drastic, even immature, choices. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two leading characters, seem to effortlessly take on the mannerisms and personalities of their respective roles. Before the first ten minutes are over, we completely forget about their idealized romance in Titanic and they BECOME Frank and April Wheeler, a tragic couple torn apart by their clashing hopes and dreams and their inability to fully understand each other the way they had when they were younger and full of life and optimism. Both of them bring just the right intensity and emotion to their scenes, and we forgive them for their mistakes and flaws because they are quite simply human. Although the entire supporting cast is good, the main standout is Michael Shannon as John Givings, the son of a 'friend' of the Wheelers who is currently residing in a mental institute. He brings the perfect blend of brashness, confidence and magnetism to his character and it's satisfying to see that his work is being recognized. He manages to convince us, simultaneously, that he is as insane as they say yet, perhaps, that he is saner than any of the other characters. Providing the heavily dramatic and uber-serious movie with an occasional comedic moment, Shannon proves here that he has the acting chops to match the daunting, impressive presences and talents of DiCaprio and Winslet.

In addition to a top-notch cast, Revolutionary Road boasts a subtly beautiful score, dazzling cinematography and fine costumes that truly represent, not only the time period, but the entire tone and message of the movie. Also, while making a few detours, the script stays faithful to the novel it is based on and does an excellent job of translating the book's feel, even though much of the emotion and drama in the novel comes more from the narration, what the characters are NOT saying, as opposed to the dialogue itself.

All in all, while it might not be for those seeking an uplifting escape from reality, Revolutionary Road is a poignant, deeply thought-provoking look at life in the suburbs, a failing relationship and the complex labyrinth of the human mind.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Great Actors but terrible storyline.,10/4/2019,ajballer88,21-一月-09,"I rated this movie with a 5 out of respect for Leo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet and their great acting abilities,so on that note the acting in this movie was about the only thing good about the movie. If it were any other two actors playing their roles I would have most definitely rated this a 1 or 2.

The beginning of the movie was slow and I was hoping for more excitement which never came. This movie was a huge let down and i actually had to stop watching the movie before it was over because I couldn't take anymore boredom. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this movie.

Revolutionary Road,Wow,10/10/2019,mmarcotte21385,13-一月-09,"It has been a long time since a movie made me laugh and cry and sit on the edge of my seat all in 2 hours. I have never in my life gone online to comment on a movie and I made an account just to comment on Revolutionary Road. I have not read the book, so I cannot compare, but this movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster of behind the scenes suburbia. I couldn't believe how I got sucked in to the acting of this movie. I almost felt as if I was their and I was fighting for them (and with them). All actors did a phenomenal job and I would recommend that if you want to spend your money at the movie theater, which for how much it costs is such a risk of disappointment these days, this is the movie that you must go see.

Revolutionary Road,Oscar worthy performances,10/10/2019,jsharma,12-一月-09,"Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank wheeler and Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, are very convincing as a happily married but extremely bored husband and wife. Their boredom with mundane activities of married life and ""emptiness"" of daily life is well understood by John Givings (played by Michael Shannon). Michael Shannon did an extremely good job as a certified lunatic with a PhD in mathematic who is recently discharged from psychiatry unit. The interaction among three main characters in the movie is based on the concept of a thin line between sanity and insanity. Kate Winslet is extremely talented and lovable ( Titanic, Little children, even not so popular Holiday and this year Reader). John has a plausible explanation of Wheeler's decisions and plans of going to Paris and then aborting all plans. Oscar worthy performances given by Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Shannon. Excellent Direction by Sam Mendes.

Revolutionary Road,The tide of time,10/10/2019,ksidirop,11-一月-09,"interesting turn of events. Kate and Leo co-starred in Titanic, a film that idealizes love and romance with both of them being restless renegades. It's ironic how the two get together in this film to tear that image apart and portrait the reality about our every day commons lives, marriage and the conventionalities we evolve around. The problem with these couples is buying the marriage-deal with a mindset of both not having lived their lives fully just yet. The moral is educating young people to stop idealizing relationships and encourage them to develop restrain instead of getting entangled in situations where they must catch up with too many things all at once (their personal ambitions, their jobs, their kids, their marriage, their inner frictions ...). To put it short: Kids + marriage + Teen Spirit Still Alive = mess

Revolutionary Road,A Road Ending In The Crash of The American Dream,10/9/2019,framedcomposition,4-一月-09,"If there is one thing that Sam Mendes seems to put across in his movies is that the American Suburbs are the last place you want to be. In American Beauty he introduced us to cast of characters who were anything but upfront about themselves and their inner desires. In Revolutionary Road it's a no holds barred grudge match with Sam Mendes in one corner and the image of 1950's American lifestyle.

From the absolute beginning the movie doesn't wait to dive into the issues of marriage and discontent. The movie doesn't build like American Beauty but hovers around in the same tense area throughout the film. These people are unhappy and no one is sugar coating it.

I would have given the film ten stars but it felt a bit manipulative at times. Constantly we are given images of misery and elusion to deep depression being experienced by the neighbors. Also the dismal existence of the 9-5 commuters and company men lined up in their dreary cubicles. We also get a glimpse into the mind of the non-conformist 50's mental patient. A tool used to show how in that period in American History people were conformed or suffer dire consequences. The dialogue is poetic but a bit too introspective for a young couple who are non-English majors. At times it feels like a propaganda film against the suburbs that Sam Mendes seems to have a distaste for. In the film there is no middle ground. It becomes either salvation or imprisonment forever in the torture which is the middle class existence.

Sam is a master of his craft and this film shouldn't be looked over. Although by the end of the film you feel the director has struck a heavy tone; You rise or fall and hope to god that you don't fall.",pos
Revolutionary Road,DiCaprio and Winslet at the top of their careers makes for a standout film,10/8/2019,Movie_Muse_Reviews,3-一月-09,"It's amazing to see where Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have gone since ""Titanic"" and it should only be fitting that they reunite in a film the demonstrates the full extent of their talents. The wide range of emotion, the external and internal struggles--without them, this film would certainly flop into obscurity, even in the hands of the talented Sam Mendes (""American Beauty""). ""Revolutionary Road"" as a script doesn't carry enough strength. It's dialog-heavy and even melodramatic at times, even if much of that dialog is responsible for adding most of the film's depth. But DiCaprio and Winslet are so commanding and convincing that you're taken by their story and Mendes brings the best out of both of them.

The timeless duo play Frank and April Wheeler, two suburbanites in the 1950s who have bought into the American ideals of the era despite their every inclination not to. Frank works a job he can't stand, April wishes she could be an actress. The film is the typical suburban conundrum: a contemporary-minded couple desire to grab life by the horns in a time where responsibility, family, practicality and self-sacrifice are the highest of values. Frank and April each wrestle with this in their own ways and it results in a lot of highs and lows for their relationship in the film.

Winslet is amazing as usual. Her inner-monologue is about the strongest of any actress in Hollywood. How she can communicate personal conflict and emotion to the audience with her expressions is astounding and in a film where she plays a woman who feels one way but is pressured to behave another, she really gets to shine. She is beautiful, enticing and tragic at different points and then all at once.

DiCaprio achieves the same effect in his own unique way. He's always been able to portray a roller coaster of emotion and playing a man who is sensitive, a bit neurotic, but also quick to defend his manhood, he has to convincingly change his emotion. He succeeds and he has to, because Frank does this a lot. His most striking strength in this film is the sensitive side in the calms after he fights with April. It's chilling how real it feels from him.

But as talented as these actors are, the parts are highly demanding. They fight, a lot, and about the same stuff, over and over again. Toward the end, their fights elicit laughter from the audience because of how over-the-top the two are forced to react to each other's piercing insults as they fly off the handle. The film needed more external stimulus of conflict, not conflict stimulated mostly by characters' thoughts. There's only so many beautiful angles and close-ups of faces that Mendes can do with a camera to maintain interest. Perhaps the point is that the Wheeler's drive themselves insane due to the nothingness that surrounds them, but films need more than that to engage us sometimes. They rarely interact with their children in the film, which would seem imperative to understanding part of their sacrifice, for example, and it would give them so much more to actually do.

The film is quite tragic, but certainly relatable. Whether its fighting with a spouse or the feeling that you're going to let life slip away because you've chosen a certain lifestyle. There's plenty of time during the film for reflection as you evaluate the arguments and decisions and decide for yourself whether they are settling or need some change.

One standout character is a man recently let of of a mental institution that the Wheelers meet as a favor to a their realtor (Kathy Bates). It's the realtor's adult son, played by Michael Shannon, who provides the film's irony--he sees the Wheelers twice, affirming their choice to make a change at first and exposing their flaws the second, digging at the contradictory roots of the film's two-faced subject matter. Shannon steals his scenes with both self-deprecating humor and by delivering his poignant lines with great strength. Why is he noteworthy in a cast with such incredible talent? Because his scenes are so refreshing in a film that is so densely wrapped up in conversation with itself, that relies on riding the coat tails of the intense emotion depicted by its characters. ""Revolutionary Road"" is nothing short of thought-provoking, it just needs to more energy and a grander purpose and that's something two of today's best actors can't entirely remedy though boy do they come close.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Seven and a Half Stars--Good Adaptation of a Great Novel,10/8/2019,brennerdj,29-十二月-08,"A Reviewer from Los Angeles, CA Minor Spoilers Director Sam Mendes creates the right sensory environment to showcase the acting of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio by filming on location in NY/NJ/CT, featuring Thomas Newman's cascading score and background music from early 1950s jazz and vocal r&b. DiCaprio looks a little too boyish in the opening scenes, but settles nicely into his mature beyond his years character within the first 30 minutes. He overplays some of the big emotional moments, but mostly captures the emotional nuance of Frank Wheeler's despair. Winslet, with her bottle blond hair and overly precise American accent, at first looks and sounds all wrong for April Wheeler, a character similar to Mad Men's Betty Draper. Despite my reservations, her performance won me over with its emotional resonance from the mid-point of the movie onward. Many actors,including Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Dylan Baker, Richard Easton, Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour, shine in smaller parts which provide some comic relief in this emotionally taxing drama.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A movie for people who love watching people argue.,10/5/2019,happyendingrocks,9-六月-09,"Let's get this out in the open: Sam Mendes' American Beauty is an absolute masterpiece. This is the sole fact that led me to set aside time for this film even though I heard nothing but bad things about it.

Revolutionary Road isn't a bad film at all, but it is inherently pointless and depressing. If you consider those negative film traits, you probably won't enjoy this too much.

You're probably going to hear that the acting on display is superb, but one would suspect that most people only say that because Leo DiCap and Katie Win are SUPPOSED to be great actors, therefore everything they do must be fantastic. They're not bad here by any means, but nothing in this film rivals the output of your local theater troupe. This isn't really LeoKat's fault; they're given very little to work with here.

We don't need to recount the plot here... You already know that this movie is about an unhappy couple. What's really missing is any source for their unhappiness. Without basic character motivation, it's hard to get too invested in their squabbles, and since all LnK do here is fight, that leaves the viewer wondering a bit why we're seeing what we are. The meager hints of the couple's malaise involve general dissatisfaction with their stations in life, which hardly seem enough to spark the two-hour cheating and screaming fest that unfolds here.

It doesn't help that Leonardo DiCaprio still looks like he's 12 years old. Not the dude's fault, and I'm not trying to be a jerk, but it's just rather strange to absorb the image of this man-of-the-house world-weary soul when said soul looks like a Junior High school lad trying on his dad's suit.

The ending is particularly perplexing, as the focus shifts to secondary characters we didn't get to know well enough to care about. There is some minor symbolism at play in the fleeting moments, but nothing that leaves the viewer with any sense of reward for their two-hour journey.

This film is best recommended for fans of LeWin who salivate at the prospect of these two gifted actors yelling at each other for transgressions ranging from infidelity to mediocre acting. This is not another slag at the stars' performances; the first argument we see in this film is indeed about KateSlett not being a good actress.

Where the catharsis comes into play here, I'm not sure. I'll concede that it's possible I missed the point somehow, but I think it's equally likely that Mendes truly thought that putting the pair who led Titanic on the screen together again was enough, and that he didn't need to make them interesting, or even likable, for us to follow them through another masterful study of failed human relationships.

KatLeo's characters in this film are miserable excuses for human beings, and whatever they get they kind of deserve. Since this film is ostensibly meant to make us sympathize with the tragedy of their crumbling union, Revolutionary Road is pretty much a failure out of the gate.

The two hours you'll spend here could be better spent watching American Beauty again instead. The asphalt here is nice and shiny, but this Road doesn't lead anywhere.",pos
Revolutionary Road,One word - BORING,10/2/2019,squirrelgrip,6-九月-09,"I sat through this movie thinking it was going to get better and like 2001 A Space Odyssey it didn't the end credits were a relief.

Critics Complained that Transformers 2 ""Revenge of the Fallen"" had no story line or plot. Revolutionary Road IMHO had less the only thing that could possibly have made it more interesting would either having the mistress get pregnant then foil the trip to Paris or the inclusion of a 30 ft tall transforming robot for comedy relief.

Transformers 2 - simple storyline, entertaining back plot.

Revolutionary Road - I'd really have to watch it a few times to even get a hint that the story had any depth what so ever over and above the disappointed house wife / unfaithful husband /wife.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Well-acted but has no life,10/4/2019,aram81,15-八月-19,"It has excellent performances, which is no surprise, given the talent involved. But the film lacks any emotions. Its stone cold, with two leads you could not care less about. In fact, the only character with any life is the mentally unstable John, played by Michael Shannon. The problem is not that the movie is sad, or the characters are troubled. There have been plenty of good movies that were sad and dealt with troubled people. The problem is that the couple in this movie have no redeeming characteristics. They are just two unlikable and miserable people who are tough to watch for two laborious hours

The stoey felt very real and it was so depressing and sad that i had to sit down and think after the movie. Few movies really move me but this is one of those movies. This is just a really sad relationship that you get to follow. If you have no experience in that maybe you wont feel moved the same way. But if you have had hard times, even in a health relationship, I think you will be moved the same way I was. A masterpice. Do not know why it got a low rating

Revolutionary Road,A Mixed Bag of Brilliance and Flaws,10/8/2019,tabuno,20-一月-19,"25 January 2009. ""Revolutionary Road"" is easily one of the more complex and inconsistently brilliant movies flecked with flaws this year. It is both stunning and irritatingly frustrating in its delivery. From the beginning ""Revolutionary Road"" recklessly and immediately jumps into an overly quick and much too brief a dive into a passionate relationship between Leo DeCarpio and Kate Winslet and then cuts to Kate Winslet's somewhat questionable but deliberate performance on stage as her character's ambition as an actress. Suddenly we are then transported into the future where we see our ""perfect couple"" with the requisite two children who seem to be conveniently missing for most of this movie. There are snatches of what seem to be flashbacks in order to provide some meaningful continuity and emotional connections which may have been better suited to a linear chronological presentation (as the flashbacks seem to disappear a third of the way into the movie). Kathy Bates is wonderful in the first half of this movie with her nuanced performance.

The plot, screenplay attempts to be strong and edgy and at times it appears to succeed, yet some of the dialogue, especially the heated arguments between Leo and Kate seem awkward and artificial at times. Nevertheless, the substantive plot points are solid and meaningfully presented as difficult dramatic elements that are successfully performed on screen. Yet for all the dazzle and flash, it is difficult to believe that the values and implicit directorial outcome of this movie might not be stained with a dislocated overlay of contemporary 21st Century morality over the actual 50s mentality and value system.

In order to make his big point and climax in the movie somewhat like ""American Beauty"" (1999), ""Revolutionary Road"" has its big scene that is not quite as satisfying because the movie continues on trying to make a statement and tie up some loose connections that even begins to resemble a horror film ending where the whole experience could repeated over again and again. While the basic statement of this movie might be legitimate, it doesn't necessarily seem consistent with the reality of the 50s and the outcome and some of the script appear to be more dramatized and made up and imposed on the societal norms of the 50s.

Who is ""crazy"" in this movie is an interesting question. Whether childish, rash notions of finding oneself here or elsewhere is the point and whether one can actually find one's self by relocating somewhere else without first examining one's inner demon's first is questionable. Overall, this movie is powerful, compelling, but appears tainted by some questionable editing decisions (one brief scene where Kate Winslet is looking away from her house instead of at it after a flashback regarding how wonderful the house seemed to reduce the emotional flow of the scene), some questionable dialogue choices and arguments that feel somewhat flat, and the imposition of basic premises regarding the culture of the 50s our assuming we can impose our beliefs of today onto it.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Beautiful,10/8/2019,eino90,9-一月-19,"Very sensitive and beautifully written story of a couple who are dealing with something that most of us are familiar with. There is nothing perfect and everything can be better. It is life and movie captures just a glimpse of what it is.. captures it so beautifully that it makes you stick to the screen and hold your breath waiting for it to conclude.

Revolutionary Road,What a couple...,10/7/2019,Thanos_Karagioras,8-一月-19,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a couple in the mid-1950s trying to surpass their personal problems and at the same raising their children. It is obvious that the couple has a lot of problems since they aren't happy with each other and seems that everything is lost. After they realize that, the woman suggest to move to Paris for a brand new start.

I liked this movie because it has an interesting plot and some very good interpretations made by its cast. I also liked the way that some problems of the couple were presented and how they tried to solve them. The direction which was made by Sam Mendes it was exceptional with many great scenes that made you feel that you were part of this movie and a friend of that couple, something that I found very important. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention Kate Winslet's who played as April Wheeler and she was simply outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Leonardo DiCaprio's who played as Frank Wheeler and Kathryn Hahn's who played as Milly Campbell.

Finally, I have to say that ""Revolutionary Road"" is a nice movie with an interesting plot and some great interpretations. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that every person has something to gain from it. Even if you have high expectations from this movie you won't be disappointed and after you watch it, you will think about a lot of things such as personal relationships, family moments etc.",pos

Revolutionary Road,The female version of American Beauty,10/7/2019,Oogway,28-六月-18,"While watching this film I indeed got the feeling this is the female version of american beauty. Then the credits rolled in & the director is Sam Mendes...so that fell into place. From the theme through the cinematography & the script (when we were young we were full of hope...and laughed at everybody that was like we are now) this is a rehash of AB but still the director shines the light at a bit of different angles, showing different variations of the characters emotions. Kate Winslet gave a very good performance but in my opinion DiCaprio was terribly miscast. Or terribly directed. His manic-depression kind of role was awkward and over the top. Perhaps we're supposed to relate with April more than Frank but in AB Annette Bening was totally relateable even-tough having a smaller role. Mendes really knows how to treat this subject and apparently likes it enough to do it over again (this coming from a man who's life is I guess not quite like his main characters...) Last point I'd like to make is regarding the film name. Like AB it packs a lot of meaning & perhaps some anarchist pointers for the real people out there.

Revolutionary Road,choose the right life,10/10/2019,lee_eisenberg,21-三月-17,"Sam Mendes had previously focused on the falsity of the suburban lifestyle with his Oscar-winning directorial debut ""American Beauty"". He returned to the topic with ""Revolutionary Road"". Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play a 1950s couple who abandoned their dream jobs in favor of a suburban lifestyle. Neither the husband nor the wife feels fulfilled. When they consider a change of pace, it exposes not only the flaws in their lifestyle but also in their relationship. And I mean with dire consequences.

Suburban Gothic is a common theme in cinema. I have no doubt that what the movie depicts happened more often than we might think. Indeed, there are still instances of people giving up on their dreams to do what they think that society expects of them.

Both DiCaprio and Winslet put on fine performances, as I expected. Far removed from their ""Titanic"" roles, their characters start out close but feel more and more distant from each other as the movie progresses. To be certain, there are some unpleasant scenes in the movie (but they do add to the plot). Also appearing is Leo and Kate's ""Titanic"" co-star Kathy Bates as a hypocritical realtor. Like ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""Save the Tiger"", the movie offers an acerbic look at the supposed idealism of the American dream. I recommend it, but remember that it's not an uplifting movie.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Objects in mirror are sadder than they appear,10/9/2019,Edd-N-Furter,27-十一月-15,"Richard Yates' seminal novel Revolutionary Road, published in 1961 has become one of the quintessential books to understand the post-WWII America with all of its virtues (the promise of a better life, the notion of happiness being attainable by achieving economic abundance, the society and communities as emotional anchors), but also its flaws (the shallowness of a society more concerned about economical success, the fear to see beyond and look for a change, the lack of ambitions and dreams or how they get lost in the way in order to seek comfort.

Frank and April Wheeler have a life other people would die for: a beautiful house in the suburbs, two charming children and they're beloved by their neighbors. Together, they're gonna make a plan to escape from this suffocating and lifeless environment. This is how April finds the perfect solution: they'll sell the house and then move to Paris, where they can find their real purpose in life. Things, however, won't be so easy, as Frank starts to have second thoughts about this idea after he gets promoted at his job, and April is not willing to give up her dream, for it represents her salvation from misery.

Director Sam Mendes assumes the challenge to bring Yates' provocative prose to the big screen with a very faithful adaptation (penned by Justin Haythe), that remarkably recalls that feeling of ""Hopeless Emptiness"" described by Yates, which ends up devouring silently not only Frank and April's mettlesome minds, but also the ones from the people around them (even if they're not fully aware of it).

Thus Mendes develops a subtle, but emotionally powerful work, backed up by admirable production values, such as Roger Deakins' enticing cinematography, Thomas Newman's delicate music and Kristi Zea's eye-catching production design, that perfectly captures the 50's atmosphere without making it obvious nor redundant.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet find not only an excuse for a long-awaited reunion, but also a perfect vehicle to deliver vividly affecting performances as Frank and April Wheeler. Leaving behind the ghosts of Jack and Rose, they succeed by embodying the souls of two lost people trying to find out who they really are and how they drag each other into a spiral of regrets and frustration.

Along with them, there's a superb supporting casting, featuring Kathy Bates as Helen Givings, the real-state agent enthralled by the Wheelers' ""immaculate life"" and Michael Shannon (in an Oscar-nominated performance) as John (Helen's son), and emotionally disturbed man, who ironically is the only one able to see Frank and April's distress and will become the voice of truth when everything falls apart for them.

Just like Mendes' Oscar-winning debut American Beauty, this movie is a harsh and effective dissection of life in American suburbia, which by the way hasn't changed that much in over half a century.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Two Leads are Miscast,10/4/2019,BatBanks,13-八月-14,"The movie is about young 1950s couple's dysfunctional marriage. When the wife masters a plan to move the family to Paris to save their marriage, careers, and unfulfilled dreams. When the husband commit infidelity, she also commit infidelity, her acting career is failure (because she can't act), and other issues that lead into tragedy.

The movie is kind of like a play both leads are miscast. Kate Winslet can't act and is not right role. She and Leonardo DiCaprio have no chemistry. It's only because fans like their relationship in Titanic (in which neither have chemistry and can't act at the time). And the film is not so great so it a skip that film topic.",neg
Revolutionary Road,The Titanic is sinking...,10/4/2019,Dragoneyed363,10-八月-14,"Revolutionary Road, what boring smut. I really wish I could have liked this film; I wanted to. Me and my boyfriend just decided to pop this in when I blind bought it. It kind of was like the sinking scene in Titanic had already ensued when this movie begun; right away it was on a downward spiral into abyss.

First off, both DiCaprio and Winslet just seem, bored and out of place. It was almost like they just were forced to do another movie together and both really had no idea of what they were getting themselves into; zero chemistry. The story is bland. Wah, we both have problems. Wah, DiCaprio isn't big enough of a man. Wah, Winslet is just a woman on the brink of her own destruction. This less than mildly amusing story continues on for an inexplicable two hour runtime, and somehow this movie never seems to pick up or come to a climax. Needless to say we both felt robbed after it was over of time and brain cells.

Revolutionary Road is anything but revolutionary in the end. It could have offered groundbreaking acting chops and story, it didn't. I take it most people loved the book and just let their ideas assume the identity of how awful this movie was to where everyone was blind enough to consider it so highly. How some movies are nominated for Oscars, I'll never know...",neg
Revolutionary Road,bad,10/4/2019,AisakaLovelis,23-六月-14,"This film shows us the comfort of western life, a hoax with which we teach and say that people should be happy. Also see two pairs actors and couple of friends who comply with the system established. The performance of the actors is good, although I have trouble seeing Leonardo Dicaprio otherwise gives me the feeling that always makes the same role in all his films and continue along the same line. The best thing about the film was Michael Shannon, in his role as crazy, dropping truths ... to what extent is crazy? Do you consider crazy out of the system?. In summary Revolucionary Road not a great movie, I expected more. All that said, I do not think that is a great movie, it is not the masterpiece it could have been. I think the film tiptoes through some problems and some solutions also affecting drama film which may not be entirely relevant, but I for one can not stop and take them into account missing your consideration.

Revolutionary Road,REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is too submissive,10/5/2019,fredberglyle,7-八月-13,"Fine acting by Leonard d' Capri and Kate Winslet that deserved applause in most scenes. Kate definitely deserved the Golden Globe. Good 1950s setup by the movie team and made me remember some good-old black and white movies of that time. The movie was realistic.

I don't personally find enough revolution on the road taken by the director for this romance-drama. No definite plot for this movie something like 'sex' followed by 'smoking' followed by 'swearing' followed by 'drinking' followed by 'hate' followed by 'despair' etc. . Dialogue was much painful but hidden with some good delivery by the lead stars.

Revolutionary Road,My rating: 9,10/9/2019,kekca,2-八月-13,"Always, when I see Leonardo DiCaprio showing in a movie I am not really enthusiastic but many of the movies with him are very good. As this one is.

It is about this how harder is for the trivial world to become different. And is it possible for the different world to become trivial? Isn't it every well-known path a revolutionary road? I hope that I will not insult someone with this - the spirit of Europe loves expressionists and expressionism, while on the opposite pole there is spirituality which finds life there cheap figuratively and literally. From the one side you can hear laughter and from the other sad crying which is capable of being happy because of the unhappiness of the others. But which one where is it? This movie shows the moment of exhausting of a relationship and the different points of view capable of supporting it. To believe on someone else's promise or to believe on your own? And if to be grown up means to give yourself up... I will not make conclusions instead of you. And about this to be wondering to keep your unborn child or not, or for the abortion in general, about this I will never change my opinion.

The moments in the wood were showing the unmistakable calculations of the elementary mathematics of truth. In its hard for reading signs, the under-questionable or without-questionable everyday life stays behind. To stay in the moment of falling in love - to state your love again and again. And to lose everything. This is the sad aftermath.

Incredible soundtrack. Film that assure you that you are alive and you can feel things.

Revolutionary Road,Leonardo DiCaprio is ruined,10/4/2019,lost-in-equestria,19-六月-13,"This movie ruined Leonardo DiCaprio for me.

In all, this movie isn't about how a couple get passed the suburban life, or how they mend their relationship in any way. No, the entire movie has nothing funny about it, it is all a huge spiral down the drain. As sad and twisted as the film is, it is extremely well filmed. Mostly the final scene with Kate is a very moving and powerful scene if you have some knowledge of women history. You will know that back then there was no real contraception and that if you were pregnant and didn't want more children were considered horrible people. The final scene is the most touching to me. Otherwise, the entire movie has no real point aside perhaps showing the mentality of the 50's. That a woman was considered crazy for wanting to be in control of her own body and wanting to provide for her husband.

But as I said in my first sentence, this movie really ruined Leonardo DiCaprio for me. He is an extremely good actor to pull that off.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Tragic and different.,10/7/2019,love_for_nails,14-九月-12,"Most of us remained with the Jack/Rose feeling from Titanic and seeing the most perfect on screen couple like this was most likely a shocking appearance. I didn't thought about this side of a story between Leo and Kate, but honestly was not that awful as I expected to be. Yes, it was sad and tragic, but I don't know why I couldn't feel that magic that I felt watching Titanic. The fight scenes were intense and that were probably the parts that delivered the seriousness of the situation, but except for that it was a pretty weak story. I understood that it was inspired from a book. I haven't heard of it nor read it so I can't judge the storyline properly, but as a viewer I thought the story was pretty weak and poor written. The actors acted fantastic, Leo and Kate were brilliant as always, I always loved those two and still love them. They delivered their characters with talent and passion and I was impressed by their performance even in this unfortunate couple state. It wasn't their fault that I didn't found the movie over all impressive, it was the screenplay which I think, thought more wisely would have been great.

Worth watching for sure though. Especially if you are a Leo or Kate fan. Or both.",pos
Revolutionary Road,a great performance by DiCaprion and Winslet,10/10/2019,kastri_gr,6-八月-12,When i first heard about the film i would not expect to be so good.And the main reason is the actors.When i heard Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet would be the main stars of the film i immediately remember Titanic and i could not combine these two people in any other film.But i was wrong.The film is excellent.There is an obvious chemistry between Dicaprio and Winslet whom in my personal opinion are much better than in Titatic without of course to turn down the film of 11 Oscars this performance seemed to me more real.Of course it locates the relationships between young couples in 1950s and the problems they had basically with the stereotypes of the society.Though i wish it had a happy ending not that this one was bad but i expected a happy ending for the couple.Otherwise it is a good choice to watch and learn important things about human relationships and how to deal with them.,pos
Revolutionary Road,Quite a Revolution in film making!,10/8/2019,leslie-gardner-322-985959,22-三月-12,"More than ten years after TITANIC, Leonardo and Kate Winslet are together again and now everyone gets to see exactly what might have happened if the couple had survived the boat going down. Hahahaha!!! And while there is nothing romantic about their reunion, they are REVOLUTIONARY Road's one true revelation. Winslet is remarkable. She is subtly but always at odds with herself inside. She wants to love her life, her husband, and on some level, she does. But she is also yearning and desperate to feel alive. DiCaprio is a bit shaky but while April's hand is less than reassuring, Winslet's hand lifts him and elevates his performance to nearly the same level as hers. To watch the two of them go back and forth between being hopeful for their futures and dismally resigned to a lifetime of unhappiness is a ride well worth taking and one that will certainly leave you dizzy by the time it comes to its harrowing close.

The problem with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is that Mendes seems more concerned in presenting the Wheeler's as a symbol for the greater point instead of allowing them to just be the relatable characters that they are. Frank and April are special. When we begin to buy into the idea that we are just like everyone else is when we become just like everyone else. When a film tries to make a point instead of just allowing the point to make itself is when a film takes on an importance it did not earn to start. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD could have been beautiful if it wasn't trying so hard to be the biggest house on the block.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road,10/6/2019,jboothmillard,6-一月-12,"From Golden Globe nominated director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead), the leading actress's then husband, it had been eleven years since the stars of Titanic had worked together, and this is an all together different mood of film. Basically Frank Wheeler (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) met April (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Kate Winslet) met each other at a party in the 1940s, and after he secures a sales career they get married, and 1955, they live in 115 Revolutionary Road, Connecticut, and have two children, son Michael (Ty Simpkins) and daughter Jennifer (Ryan Simpkins). To many people, including their friends, real estate business worker Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) and her husband Howard (Richard Easton), and neighbours Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) and her husband Shep (David Harbour), they seem like any regular happy couple with a good suburban family life. But Frank and April's relationship is troubled, as she has failed to achieve her dream to be an actress and is forced to be housewife, and he is working in a New York City office job he hates, it has become a repetitive lifestyle and the passion is fading. One day, thinking it will make things better for both of them, and possibly the whole family, April suggests they should move to Paris, France, a place that Frank once said he would love to live in since he enjoyed it so much, and at first this sounds a big decision to make. As part of the plan to move, it would mean April would be the one bringing in the money from working a high salary secretarial job for a major international organisation, leaving Frank free to decide about his options and what to do, and after initial concern he agrees it sounds like a great idea. They tell all that would need to know about their plan to move to Paris, and there are mixed opinions from those, such as their friends they have known for years, and especially from Frank's work colleagues. Circumstances change for him, and even though he has never liked the work he does, it has been considered most satisfactory, he is even being offered a promotion with higher salary, and with April pregnant again there are second thoughts from him. She is contemplating having an abortion because of the tension between them, and this angers Frank so much that he concludes moving to Paris is a decision and dream too big to make a reality, and he accepts the promotion at work. One night April has Shep coming onto her, but she denies his advances, and the next day Frank admits to (apparently) having an affair with his office assistant, hoping his wife will have some sort of reaction, but she responds by saying that it no longer matters as she does not love him any more. That night they have the Givings round for dinner, including their troubled son John (Oscar nominated Michael Shannon) joining him, and John really lets rip about his opinions about Frank apparently getting April pregnant on purpose, and the friends run out in the heat of the moment. Frank and April have another big argument as well, to the point when she runs away, and after trying to get her back going after her, he goes back feeling low. Next morning they seem surprisingly calm having breakfast together, their moods improved, but right after Frank has left the house she takes the horrific action to give herself an abortion to the baby that has developed after a few weeks, but this proves fatal for her. Frank is hysterical in grief because he knows she killed herself killing the unborn baby, but apparently he continued to work at the company with the upcoming computer technology, and devoted all his time to his children. Also starring Happiness's Dylan Baker as Jack Ordway. Both DiCaprio and Winslet are extraordinary being so realistic in the domestic environment, and they really emphasise that life cannot be perfect as they come to terms with the heartaches thrown at them, it works really well because you can relate to the hardships they face, and the dark hard hitting material such as unwanted pregnancy and abortion doesn't disappoint to grip you, it is most watchable period drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Good!",pos
Revolutionary Road,Something To Inspire,10/9/2019,ron-de-weijze,2-一月-12,"The USA must have felt the time after two wars the same as Europe, especially after intervening. A time to rebuild, to count blessings, to try what is valued and value what is tried. Infrastructure for everybody, from the interior house decorations to the exterior career structures. Good old cronies not excluded. The setting for a republican life I guess. If the structures are a little to tight, there are hardly ways out except for Paris and getting knocked up by a friend. Or to get sent to a shrink for whom the raise would pay too.

A great excuse for the arrival of the 60s and the birth of the new world-view, which would primarily be the overthrow of all values keeping this life together: God, Truth, self and reality. Beautiful styles and architectures do not count, when the rhythm of returning wars seems to stop, we simply continue on the Revolutionary Road by blowing ourselves up. Is this of all times? No this is typically 50s with a huge after-burn till our days. But very good that these reviews are created at all.

We do want to go back in time, there has never been so much retro as today, especially in films and on TV. Mad Men, Pan Am, *series* about these times. Clearly there is something we did not get over, in spite of all the philosophers accounting for what happened and why we lost what we did, telling us otherwise (Derrida, Zizek). Some will agree, in NY and on liberal corners. Many will feel there still is something that was good about those times that these films and their scriptwriters have left out, something which will continue to inspire the creation of these films.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Unengrossing and bizarre, yet very worthwhile",10/6/2019,Wuchakk,31-十月-11,"Eleven years after their mega-hit ""Titanic,"" Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite for ""Revolutionary Road,"" released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty, whereas Leonardo is definitely a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a drama about a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates, whereas April (Kate) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. April's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Feeling emasculated, Frank has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April comes up with a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of total exhilaration and April desperately wants Frank to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the miserable corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of living dead in their midst?

I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent ""Snow Angels,"" the potent ""Grand Canyon"" or the masterpiece ""Dead Poets Society,"" but ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my main criteria for evaluating any flick.

Yet it does have some glimpses of greatness. For one, the movie possesses a very real bizarreness that's hard to explain. Seriously, this is easily one of the most slyly offbeat dramas I've ever seen. Secondly, Michael Shannon as John Givings, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), is a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their suburban paradise are crazy. Big surprise. But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really insane. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war ""paradise,"" and spit on it, for better or worse.

The film raises some important questions: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is their more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?

""Revolutionary Road"" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.

The film was shot in Connecticut & NYC and runs almost 2 hours.

FINAL WORD: Because of the unengrossing characters and story, I can only grade ""Revolutionary Road"" as a strong C+. But I can see why others rate it higher because it does have flashes of greatness and it definitely makes you reflect on its themes. In some ways, the same message is addressed in ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon,"" to a lesser extent) -- rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams -- the difference is that ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"") accomplished this with a captivating story whereas ""Revolutionary Road"" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is.

But this is a film that might get better with repeat viewings. We'll see. I'll be sure to adjust my rating if so.

In any event, it's definitely worth catching if these themes trip your trigger.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Fine Acting; Nasty Characters,10/2/2019,RGismondi,19-六月-11,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Reviews have mentioned outstanding acting, excellent settings and artwork, etc. I agree with those comments.

However, a movie is a story--entertainment. And this story was horrible. None of the characters were likable. In fact, every major character was at least annoying, and most were nasty. The whole plot was depressing, and reflected a pathological world view. Not one character was happy or well adjusted. None were admirable in the slightest.

That the resources put into this movie created so little of value is absolutely astounding to me. And the viewers who rated this movie highly are indicative of cultural decline.

The decision makers need rehabilitation--or more.

Revolutionary Road,"""Mediocre ReUnion For A Dream Pair""",10/6/2019,kimi_layercake,19-三月-11,"""Revolutionary Road"" is a drama film about a couple whose lives spiral out of control owing to compulsions of life putting restraint on their desires to live a free and uncomplicated life, something not achieved.

Cast wise, Excellent. Leo and Kate give their best to their respective roles but at moment, the acting seems a bit stretched and over done. But the core of the movie has to be Kate Winslet, who brings on screen a very mesmerizing performance worthy of awards. Rest chips in well.

""Revolutionary Road"" strength lies in its casting. Story wise, nothing much to tell. It weakens itself in the Screenplay, Editing And Direction part. Frankly, the Screenplay could have been better and the Editing with Direction doesn't help raise the movie beyond the level of an Average movie. It's Kate Winslet who elevate the movie, barring the negative aspects.

Overall, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a One Time Watch movie. Also, it's difficult to like and dislike the movie simultaneously. But I believe the dream pair of Kate And Leo could have reunited for a better movie than this mediocre piece of work.

Revolutionary Road,revolutionary road is a street,10/6/2019,tanelteder,9-三月-11,"I like dramas. Good dramas make me smile because obviously they're so fascinating to see. But this one here, I don't know. It didn't achieve its purpose. It was like a tragedy. The more to the ending, the more story got depressing. But when I shun that, the movie itself was built really well. Storytelling was quite good one. This picture takes place in 50's, so the art-direction for the movie is very auspicious. There have been done some remarkable job.

Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors. Leo and Kate Winslet haven't been in a same movie since Titanic back in 97'. Their reunion for this frustrating movie is the best outcome from it. They both give good performances, but as you could guess, there's no great destiny here for them too. Some couples just look good, but it doesn't mean they last forever.

Leo and Kate live in a nice white house which is located in Revolutionary Road. At first, I thought the title means the 'road' a young couple are going through, but I was way wrong. It's actually just a street name. But revolutionary for sure.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary characters on a road that curved to brilliance,10/9/2019,napierslogs,28-一月-11,"As Frank and April Wheeler move to Revolutionary Road, it is indeed hard to remember if they are the young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, or the young Revolutionaries on Wheeler Road. This was noted by mental institution patient, John (Michael Shannon) and I agreed with him. Part of the brilliance of ""Revolutionary Road"" is having the one character who is deemed mentally unfit also be the one voice of reason.

Director Sam Mendes takes us back to the 1950s to a Connecticut Suburb, where you were supposed to get married, have kids and play house. And if you wanted to play in a pretty house with a pretty wife and kids, then you had to work at a job you didn't like. Frank and April are more perceptive and innovative than those around them, and they believed that they didn't have to live that life to be happy. They could move to Paris and do whatever they wanted.

Revolutionary Road was not a straight road, and although it never really twisted or turned, it did curve. Frank and April could see past their neighbours, but they couldn't see past themselves. Instead of a revolutionary move across the ocean, we got to examine trust issues that only spanned the suburb and the city. And for as forward-looking as they are, they couldn't see what was holding them back. But we could.

I was fascinated by ""Revolutionary Road"" because they gave me a revolutionary character that I could instantly connect with, and the resolutions for Frank and April were always just around the bend that you could almost see. DiCaprio, Winslet, Mendes and writer Justin Haythe have enough talent and nerve to drive me straight to the end without stalling.",pos
Revolutionary Road,An astounding piece of cinema art,10/10/2019,yshtok,5-十一月-10,"This is one of a very few reviews I wrote, despite the huge amount of movies passing through. Its just that this one has made a very strong impression, stirred me so deep I was surprised it is still possible. There is no ""action"", not even any dramatic events along, no special effects or mind-boggling ideas. It is just... it brings ups things that are so fundamentally TRUE, so much in the core of people and their relationships, and simultaneously so BASIC, that mesmerizes you completely. Many time I would jump of a seat and run describing the storyline to my wife (who is in no position to watch movies right now), which triggered quite an involved discussion. The actors were at their best performance I have seen to them so far, and there were many great roles by Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, you will agree. I like Leo, but I couldn't believe he is capable of such act. I am not familiar with other director's works, so I can't compare, but the entire piece feels very different from the load of of the Hollywood movies, despite being in the same format. Michael Shannon was brilliant - hell, there is no single mediocre performance in this move, despite there is of course some marginal roles. Summarizing, I am amazed such movies are still possible, such storyline can be made and such act can be observed. If you are disappointed of the western cinema, or you think you've seen it all - Revolutionary Road is the movie which will return you hope.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road was a revolution of emotion,10/7/2019,moviesaccordingtodes,14-十月-10,"Revolutionary Road really touched me. I thought that the struggles and emotions were very real. Though this movie contained two amazing actors, the acting was just not believable for me. They were going through very difficult, heart wrenching times and I just did not care. The acting wasn't believable. I felt like they were trying too hard and maybe just couldn't connect to the emotion. Dicaprio and Winslet are two of my favorite actors but in Revolutionary Road, it just seemed like they were memorizing a script.

I was kind of lost with the flash backs and flash forwards. I couldn't tell when they were flashing back because the actors always appear to be the same age. It was too subtle.

The plot was very powerful. It was sad, sweet, and kind of inspiring. It rang true to the struggles two people can face together. I feel this film would have been more enjoyable if the actors connected with the plot.

Revolutionary Road,"A great insight on the ""emptiness"" deep down",10/10/2019,books-from-boxes,11-八月-10,"A great performance by both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio! Their chemistry is far more visible in this movie rather than in ""Titanic"". They have both grown into complete actors and with this movie they have proved that they can mirror a wide range of emotions convincingly and also that they can lure the audience into entering a (non)fictional world without taking notice of anything else.

The movie portrays the story of two human beings in an American 1950's suburb that hold a battle against each other and against themselves. The battle is held for the freedom of the soul; it is a rebellion against mediocrity and the greatest tragedy people face everyday. It is a movie that raises many questions regarding Life and what people do with it.

I believe that a movie like this can't do anything else, but leave a bitter taste in one's mouth because it depicts exactly what we don't want to face. A mere handful of people do indeed take advantage of this frail gift we possess - Life, but most allow it to pass by them much like strangers in the street. Most might dislike this movie especially because it tells this bitter truth that we don't want to acknowledge.

Watch the movie!!!",pos
Revolutionary Road,You will think about this movie every day,10/9/2019,lisa-629,3-八月-10,"This is one of the best Sam Mendes films I can think of. Casting was perfect, and the story was impeccable. The story takes place in the 1950s. Being an American History teacher, I adore films about the 50s. This movie captures the prison in which women may have found themselves being married and attempting to fulfill the stereotypes of what a woman was supposed to be in the 1950s. Kate Winslet captures the hell she is living, and allows the audience into her tormented world, even if only briefly. You feel for DiCaprio's character at times, but realize that both of them are victims of their era, not of each other. The last 15 minutes of this film are burned into my mind, and I think about this movie constantly. The acting is superb, you will not be disappointed in any way with this film.

Revolutionary Road,Extremely realistic and moving,10/10/2019,skullballmovies,25-七月-10,"Movies like It's a Wonderful Life and American History X show us how grateful we should be for our lives and how we should respect other people. Revolutionary Road, however, shows us how frustrating life can be. I've wanted to see a movie that finally nailed this, and I think I got it with this movie. It shows us that giving things up for our dreams isn't easy at all, and sometimes we need to check to see that those dreams are realistic and easy enough to do. This was the whole theme of the movie and I couldn't have asked for it to be better. Leonardo and Kate were acting gold and were completely believable together. They made me believe that they were a real couple and this was a real situation. It's an extremely depressing movie but it tells a great lesson. Maybe one that we don't necessarily want to hear, but we have to hear it anyway.

Revolutionary Road,Complex and rewarding,10/7/2019,ferdinand1932,1-五月-10,"The theme of the authentic life was intellectually popular it the Fifties. Existentialism made it a movement: Sartre and De Beauvoir explored it: in her case more successfully, as she is a better writer.

This film depends on the leads and DiCaprio has this in the bag: his performance is just ideal, a mix of hope and rage, He looks and sounds the part. Winslett is fine as April but her character is very complex and almost too ambiguous to really understand. She speaks in a strange and restrained manner which withholds her from the action. That is not to say it is wrong, but rather it is unusual in movie terms.

In fact Winslett's April Wheeler is the crux of the story. It's hard to know whether their marriage is bad anyway, or if moving to Paris will solve anything. April Wheeler has creative instincts as shown early on by acting in a play, which are frustrated. Husband Frank Wheeler is like thousands of people who say they have a novel inside them but in fact they concede their vague and possibly vain ambitions by increments as they manage day to day life.

It is a shame that this story ends badly as if they, and no one, can ever win the battle to escape the 'burbs, the job, the predictable and inauthentic business life.

The device in this story of having a 'crazy person' tell the truth serves a plot purpose but is not very stylish in 1961, when the book was published.. Shakespeare used it, in having the fool tell kings about reality.

Deakins's photography and Mendes's guidance are superb, the tone is right, as are the production qualities too. This film will provoke thoughts for a long time after.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A cinematic punch to the gut.,10/9/2019,lewiskendell,30-三月-10,"Wow. I'm almost at a loss for words. Revolutionary Road was one of the most honest and emotionally involving movie experiences that I've seen in months. It's fairly rare that a film leaves such a strong impression on me, but I'm pleased to say that it has happened once again. 

The music, acting, and directing are brilliant, but that is to be expected from a movie with this many talented people involved. I won't go into any particulars about the plot. It's best that a viewer experiences this with no pre-defined expectations, like I did. Just know that there are some incredibly complex issues presented here, and there are no easy solutions to be found. Revolutionary Road is undeniably sad, but there's a complete lack of those ""tug-on-your-heartstrings"" moments. It's all brutal and true to life. That's what makes the movie so compelling. You can't watch it, without thinking about yourself.

Revolutionary Road,Another Trip on the Titanic!,10/8/2019,Hitchcoc,25-一月-10,"I read this novel in college. It was absolutely biting then and I have kept it with me for over 30 years. The movie is so painful to watch. I remember the fifties and their sterility and the roles people were expected to play. A few years had past since the end of the war and people were happy just to be bored. April (Kate Winslet) is ahead of her time. We know this because the talk she talks is stunning to the neighbors. He plans to embrace bohemianism make most around her think she is crazy. DeCaprio tries hard but thinks she is also nuts. There is so much angst in each scene. Some of the people who have found fault with this film are judging these people with criteria based on contemporary life. It was so much duller then and so were the people. They chose to be dull. This sets up a powder keg. The ""Wheelers,"" rolling forward, have the respect and admiration of all those around them. He is handsome; she is stunning. They have two beautiful kids. His job is tiresome, but he apparently makes a little money, enough so he wouldn't have to work for six months if they went to Paris. The best scenes are when the realtor who sold them the house on Revolutionary Road (certainly an ironic title because nothing revolutionary happens) brings her bipolar (perhaps) son to visit. He is the real spokesman for the movie. The crazy guy who really knows what is going on. Anyway, this film cuts to the heart, showing people who have failed to but heads with the realities of their time. The acting is quite good though it is really hard to like either of the characters much. Silence is another main character. It's like a grim reaper when it appears.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Dark and unsettling but fascinating,10/9/2019,preppy-3,10-一月-10,"This takes place in the mid-1950s in Connecticut. There's a young couple named Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). They have a big beautiful house in the suburbs and two kids...but they're miserable. Frank hates his job and April's dreams of becoming an actress are shattered. Things slowly get darker and more serious and leads to a disturbing ending.

This is NOT a feel-good film. It's dark and unpleasant but it is an incredible look at the dark side of the picture perfect American suburb of the 1950s. The cars, clothes, furnishings and music are right on target. The acting by the leads is incredible. DiCaprio explodes in his role. He's miserable and slowly gets angrier. He's downright terrifying! Winslet had the much more difficult role of his wife but she's brilliant. You see her crumbling inside and trying to hold herself together. Just incredible. Everybody is good but a little extra credit goes to Michael Shannon playing the dangerously crazy John. There is some humor though. I got a big kick out of one woman who smokes constantly in the movie even when she's pregnant!

There are a few missteps. This does have its slow parts and the kids the couple have seem to disappear completely for long periods of time. You would think they would play a part in their parents lives but that never seems the case. Still this is a fascinating if depressing look at suburban life in the 1950s. Obviously not for everybody. I give it a 9.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Proof that ""some Women"" are Insane",10/7/2019,rrryoyorrr,4-一月-10,"This movie is really great at revealing how some women are just insane, and they drag their husbands down like a ton of bricks. April, Kate Winslet, is great at playing a depressed, housewife, who has unfulfilled dreams of being an actress, let ruin both her and her husband's, Frank, Leo DiCaprio's, ""perfect life"" in the suburbs. Unfortunately, this is a story that is played out everyday by men and women who live together in reality. Frank has no idea what he has done to cause April to stop caring for him, after all, he really loves her, does his job as the supporting husband, and even tries his best to understand her. Yet, despite all he does for her, she is still unphased, and could care less about him. For Frank, April's resentment towards him is unbearable, because he does not know what he did wrong. Frank even blames himself for April's absurd behavior, but it is really April's self-loathing that is ruining their lives. The end pretty much sums it up for Men who want to stay in a relationship. Watch the movie before you decide to get married.

Revolutionary Road,Trailer Held More Potential Than Final Product,10/6/2019,aznangel2,3-一月-10,"Perhaps it was just me overlooking how trailers tend to inflate a movie to something bigger than what it really is, but I really did have hope for this movie. It seemed epic and heart-wrenching, like a classic that could make you cry every single time you watched it. Sadly, however, it did not impart an impact remotely as strong as I expected. Don't get me wrong, it had its high points. The storyline is sound. The acting, the emotion, absolutely riveting. My dissatisfaction only spawned from how short it seemed after it ended. Something was not right. I was so captivated with the trailer, it might as well have been a short film itself. But the movie...the transition, the build-up of conflict...it could have been better. The ending would have been the fantastic cherry on top, would have absolutely torn me apart had I just fallen a little deeper in love, become a little more entangled with the characters and their plight. If only they had been developed a little more. Additionally, I found the musical score to be severely bland. Wild Is the Wind was perfect for the trailer, and I thought the movie's sound tracks should have been built around its theme.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Dull. Plodding. Obvious, Redemmed only by Kate Winslett",10/4/2019,Brian B-2,1-一月-10,"There must be dozens if not hundreds of more interesting takes on ""hopeless emptiness"" and the despair of suburban existence, trapped in a life not lived. This film treads the same turf as ""Mad Men"", but without the subtly pace or humour.

I would not have watched until the long telegraphed conclusion of the story, except that Kate Winslett is radiant whenever she is on the screen. She also brought nuanced acting to her performance, though her accent slipped occasionally. DiCaprio, on the other hand, in my opinion, over acted horridly, displaying anger, confusion, passion, all by shouting and glaring.

The pacing was tedious - too many lingering shots of people staring off into their souls; too many cars pulling into driveways. It felt as padded as a 1960s bra.

Zoe Kazan in a small role as DiCaprio's office fling was a pleasure, but there were too few of those. None of the characters except Winslett's show more than two dimensions.",neg
Revolutionary Road,Powerful and subtle,10/9/2019,pontifikator,5-十月-09,"This bleak, bleak film was hard for me to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely mesmerized me as Frank Wheeler, and the supporting cast was phenomenal. Kathy Bates and Kathryn Hahn were heartbreaking; Michael Shannon was alternately dead and manic as the certified insane version of Frank and April Wheeler (April was played by Kate Winslet). But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Frank meets April and they get married. April has dreams of becoming an actress, but she's lousy. Leonardo DiCaprio's attempt to soothe April while blowing off her ambitions was utterly believable. DiCaprio's Frank is a shallow jerk with no soul and no ambition. I didn't know DiCaprio was this good. ""Revolutionary Road"" shows their lives together in the Fifties, as they end up in the march of grey flannel suits in grey, sterile lives. Shannon's character, John Givings, gives voice to their hopeless emptiness. Frank and April make a big decision to blow it all off, move to Paris, and live a happy, fulfilling life. April actually has a plan, and it looks like she can pull it off. Her dream of being an actress may have foundered, but getting out of the rut of suburban Connecticut, office life in Manhattan, and forced parties and entertainment definitely looks doable.

The characters in this movie are relentlessly human. From the beginning, Frank has no real appreciation for April's dreams, but he eventually realizes she's a human being with some feelings. They have two kids, and Frank wants to be a good father to them, and succeeds for the most part. He's not perfect; neither is April; but who is? As the years pass, Frank seems to be more aware of April's needs, less inclined to dismiss her. I watched their ups and downs, but there was a serious note throughout that kept me edgy, upset. Thomas Newmans' music echoed the tension without being tense; his theme was brilliant, spare.

The picture of life in the Fifties shown in this film is stultifying, claustrophobic, suppressive. One had to give parties, one had to dress correctly, one had to say the right things (""Oh! You shouldn't have! This is _too_ good!"") - one had to conform. Frank had the peer pressure of conforming at the office, and April had the wifely peers pressuring her at the home. This kind of pressure makes diamonds. Or it crushes souls. It was a pressure that welded Frank and April into one crushed soul.

April doesn't seem to realize consciously her need to get out of the Fifties; Frank doesn't have that need at all, but he goes along because he intuits that it's a requirement. April has their tickets, their passports, and their dreams all in her hand, ready to go. She even has her job lined up. She'll support them while Frank looks after the kids and looks for work. I watched April's happiness with dread. It's the Fifties. Wives didn't work. Wives didn't support the family. Winslet's April has the brains and the ambition, the soul, that Frank lacks. But it's the Fifties. There's nowhere for her to go with it. There's nowhere for a woman's dreams.

""Revolultionary Road"" is powerfully subtle. And the end I was left drained. Empty. There's no Hollywood ending here. I kept thinking of Rick telling Ilsa, ""We'll always have Paris."" In ""Revolutionary Road,"" I knew they'd never have Paris.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A woman's childish unrealistic demands are a road to hell in 50's era setting.,10/7/2019,dilbertsuperman,28-八月-09,"This drama focuses primarily on Frank and Amy Wheeler, a married couple with two children that reach a crossroads when Amy completely loses her skull on an idea about moving to Paris, France as both the ultimate life achievement to match their goals and also the most pressing and important issue in front of them as a couple. Frank is going to Paris or else this insane woman is going to make his life a living hell. Poor Frank gets dragged down by his woefully insane and melodramatic wife's unfulfilled need for .. ? What we never really know, but Amy wants it, and it's in Paris, damnit. She has no money to take the family there, no ability to work there to finance the idea, but somehow it's FRANK's fault they are not in Paris yet. This woman just gets battier and battier as the movie goes on, which is an interesting juxtaposition against the good old 50's style of conformity. If you like watching Leonardo Di Caprio argue heatedly with his utterly insane yet well spoken wife, there's a lot of scenes of that here. A lot.

Overall the characters are pretty well developed and the movie is shot well with some nice old cars, etc.. It didn't seem like they really knew how to end the movie properly; overall it was a well acted flick. The most interesting character is a fellow on leave from an insane asylum who talks with the couple.. he's essentially the voice in this Woman's head and an interesting character foil for her madness.",pos
Revolutionary Road,A movie that touches the soul,10/9/2019,michelasp,6-八月-09,"I recently watched the movie The Revolutionary Road, a drama about an unhappy married couple living in the 50s. Sam Mendes paints a picture of American suburbia, reminiscent of a world well into the industrial revolution when people felt the benefits of a booming economy. Indeed in the 1950s the American economy was the strongest in the world. Keeping up with the Jones' was a part of life, as was hypocrisy, intolerance and the dried-up imagination which often went hand in hand with the consumerist, work-driven lifestyle, where the women were pushed aside to make way for the bread-winning man. The latter theme is excellently portrayed in scenes such as the rush hour at the train station where men bustle through as if taking over the city, and at Frank's office which is completely male dominated apart from a handful of female secretaries. The reaction of their conventional friends when April (Kate Winslet) and her husband Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) announce that Kate will be supporting the family in Paris speaks volumes of the place of women at the time. The dried-up imagination is lucid when the friend exclaims ""what for?"" when told they will be emigrating to Paris.

I love a film that does not need only words to convey its message, and this movie is one of them. April's strained body language when her dreams of moving to Paris are shattered, the shots of the lifeless empty rooms with dull furniture and the brown and gray suits of Frank and his wearisome colleagues depict a pervasive ""hopeless emptiness"". The whole scenario spells insipid, and when Kate and Frank excitedly discuss the possibility of leaving this depressing existence behind for a new and interesting life in exotic Paris, we as viewers are intrigued. We want them to pack up and go and we look down on the conventional couple that will be left behind to rot in their unsavory, bigoted existence. Ironically it is the mentally unstable John Givings who seems to see through everyone's facade, and pushes them all to face their truth. ""Hopeless emptiness. Now you've said it. Plenty of people are onto the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Despite the dramatic turns in the plot, it is the simple images like this that stick – Frank dressed in his suit standing next to his car and waving to his wife perhaps thinking that if he acts like everything is alright and normal, it will be. There is a clash between the adventurous and bohemian and the practical and rational approach to life, whereby you do as is expected of you, and life is defined by your success and place in society. It is a movie that hits home because of what it encourages us to ask ourselves, a rhetorical and age-old question that influences the course of all our lives and is easily a fodder for debate: what is our meaning in life?

The title is an irony that you may find follows you throughout the film. 'Revolutionary' conjures images of the young and fitful - restless souls that seek to change the world. Yet Kate's dreams are stifled by the 'oh come on, stop it' attitude and her tragic end dashes our own hopes for their new found purpose in life. Most of us will be left disappointed after already having decided that Anne's words and a prevalent message of the movie meshes with our own belief: ""It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.""",pos
Revolutionary Road,Steamy and Stimulating,10/8/2019,liupower,19-六月-09,"This is one of the best film i watched in these few years. Gorgeous and outstanding performance of Leonardo..dreamy yet reality hold you on the ground...holding you on the ground yet make you become dreamy...

Story line is Oscar level definitely...at least much better than most so called Oscar nominated lately... this movie can be depressing yet forward looking..it is complicated..I don't know how to say that, to be honest, just watch it. You wont regret, make sure you get yourself a glass of wine....(spicy one like Shiraz, then a sweet sweet dessert--caramel slice) then watch it with no expectations... just imagine another boring titanic, then u will realize the simple story is actually so complicated that will drive you crying. even a man like me..

Revolutionary Road,It will leave you Speechless,10/10/2019,mitchelledwards,15-六月-09,"Director Sam Mendes best known for his work behind the camera in American Beauty (2000) delivers a powerful and poignant film. The story revolves around a young married couple Frank and April Wheeler played to perfection by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet (she won the Oscar) who are desperately trying to break the conformity of 1950's living. Technically this film is astounding the shots are done beautifully the lighting creates all of the right moods and the score is just haunting. Also the emotion of the script is felt by the way that Leo and Kate play off of each other, I think that Leo has been coming into his own over the past few years with films like Blood Diamond and The Departed but for me this was definitely the best performance of his career. Kate did an outstanding job and like I stated before won the Oscar for last year, anyway see this film you might not enjoy it but you will definitely remember the journey down Revolutionary Road.

Revolutionary Road,Redefining Marriage,10/7/2019,brooks-was-here,15-六月-09,"The very first thought come to my mind after watching this film is, if that was what marriage all about, I'd rather choose to stay alone quietly. Honestly, both DiCaprio and Winslet were doing a fantastic job in showing the emptiness and hollowness of the routine married life. With the consciousness of getting far away from the initial goal of life, they feel desperate and decide to leave, start over at where their dreams begin. However, it was once again being proved, reality comes bigger than everything. Life is fragile once you lose the faith, even a flash of thought can absolutely destroy everything, including those illusionary happiness.

Revolutionary Road,Great Cinematography; Unrealistic Ending,10/5/2019,sanosito,11-六月-09,"OK. The cinematography captures the exact way color photographs look like from the mid 1950s. Neat. Too bad so many things in the sets were not readily available to the American consumer at that exact time.

Hey. The acting was really superior in this film! It is hard to believe that the two leads are the same two kids from Titanic. They have both come a long way from that stinker. And Kathy Bates; she is ALWAYS great. Come to think of it, Kathy Bates could have played any character in this film with ease, except for the ""idiot"" son. That would have been a too normal character for her.

The April character was dead on realistic until the very end. Point in fact: She would have either had the abortion secretly early on, so as to not screw up the agreed upon planned move to Paris, or she would have simply left and gone without hubby and the first two kids to Paris when she realized hubby was not who she thought he was. Then, after the birth of baby #3, she would have gladly shipped it back to hubby when he demanded it.

Sad but truer.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Far from Heaven and Far From Hell,10/4/2019,billion_mucks,15-五月-09,"Since the quiet triumph of Haynes' ""Far from Heaven"" among the most delicate critic circles films have been trying to recompose the elegant justice of Sirk's urban dramas proper from the 50's. Revolutionary Road is a clean, obvious attempt at that.

From the ornate composition of interiors to the double-standard acting myriad everything is a blatant attempt to reconstruct the epoca of the 1950 and the movies characteristics of it. The wrong turn is taken with the unattractive story, the common and stamped characters and the very weak development. Di Caprio, though, is phenomenal. On my part, Winslet was overly dramatic and boring.

Decide yourself, the movie relies on the objective of being a time machine, a reconstruction, but it's not worth an instant viewing.

Revolutionary Road,Playing Devil's Advocate,10/10/2019,specialagent69,22-四月-09,"Has anyone ever thought that maybe they both gave up? Rather than just him calling it quits. And her throwing an irreversible tantrum. Maybe instead of moving to France, leaving all their friends and family behind, they could have stayed and affected their friends and family (society). Don't throw up the WhiteFlag just yet-kind of styles. Great film to bring up a major topic like Humane Social standards. BTW, Michael Shannon's performance as John Givings, as the French say: 'Tour De Force!' I want to see Part II called 'The Crazy Guy from Revolutionary Road'. Maybe get Kal Penn & John Cho to Direct. And might as well put them in the film too. 'Harold & Kumar Go To Revolutionary Road to hang out with John'.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Sailing Down to Revolutionary Road,10/7/2019,samuelding85,22-四月-09,"Sam Mendes make an adaptation on Richard Yates novel into a movie, and pairs the couple who melted the hearts of millions with the 1997 blockbuster, Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had a reunion in Revolutionary Road, which finally, Jack and Rose has become husband and wife, under the name of Frank and April Wheeler.

Set in the suburban of Connecticut during the 1950's, Revolutionary Road is an exploration on a couple seeking a better life, which is to fulfill their dreams by migrating to Paris. One can easily compared Revolutionary Road with Mendes first big screen work, American Beauty (1999.) Frank and April settles in Connecticut, with a big house, 2 lovely kids, a job that has no problem putting bread on the table. However, Frank do not like his job, while April is drowning herself in sadness when she is unsuccessful in becoming an actress. Things take a drastic change when both decided to migrate to Paris, with 2 issues hindering their plans: Frank getting a promotion and April getting pregnant. What falls ahead of them are countless challenges on their relationship of an unhappy matrimony.

One will never be disappointed with any movies from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, since both has never delivered disappointing performances. With their outstanding performance in Titanic, Revolutionary Road will never disappoint anyone who is expecting more from the couple.

Sam Mendes discussed the issue of an American dream turned sour in American Beauty, where he introduces a failed husband seeking a breakthrough for himself, a wife who wants to break free from a loveless marriage, a daughter with growing up issues, infidelity, erotic dreams and drugs. Things take a turn in Revolutionary Road, where similar issues were discussed.

Together with the scores composed by Thomas Newman, one could see the shadow of American Beauty in Revolutionary Road. The husband having a quarrel on the dinner table, the wife who wants to fulfill her dreams at the expense of her husband to a neighbor who is a former mental hospital patient, we could easily see the linkage between American Beauty and Revoultionary Road.

While American Beauty begins with an brief introduction of The Burnham's family and their neighborhood, Revolutionary Road begins with how Frank and April knowing each other in a party. The next scene begins with Frank and April, now a married couple, facing the problems they had in their marriage. Mendes is taking a twist in terms of presentation for both movies discussing similar issues.

Just like the environment in Revolutionary Road, it was peaceful and calm, where one would slow down their paces and enjoying what is around them. Mendes handles the nature of the story and present it in a way where one will not feel much harsh elements in Revolutionary Road, compared to the straight-to-your-face reality featured in American Beauty. This can be told by the unexpected ending for the movie.

Sailing down to Revolutionary Road is not as disastrous compared to taking the maiden voyage in Titanic. While one will wrench in Titanic, they will appreciate the beauty of Revolutionary Road, which will not be easily forgotten.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Fabulous acting, heart-wrenching story",10/8/2019,sprintz1132,18-四月-09,"Revolutionary Road is probably most known for its long awaited reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The duo last met in 1997 on a doomed cruise ocean liner in the phenomenally famous blockbuster Titanic. Ironically enough, in 2008, the sinking ship in this situation is their marriage. Through a series of violent arguments and morally questionable behavior, Frank and April Wheeler play the exact opposites of Jack and Rose. Instead of being driven mad with affection for each other, they are stuck in an unhappy relationship being driven mad by all the restrictions that their stagnant lifestyle imposes on them.

Trapped in the confines of 1950s suburbia, the Wheelers are living with their children in a quiet little house on a quiet little street. April stays at home and Frank goes to the office. Every day, though, things progress more and more into disillusion as the two start to wonder where their hopes and dreams went. Their lives have been restricted to boundaries of their seemingly picture-perfect life, but on the inside, the strains of commitment and ennui have weakened their relationship significantly. The film is somewhat of a mockery of how we are all forced to hide our problems and put on the old dog-and-pony show to make us look nice on the outside, while behind closed doors there are struggles no one can imagine. Things start looking up for the Wheelers when April suggests that they move to Paris and finally do what they've always wanted to do. An unexpected pregnancy, though, prevents them from going and so begins a slow, downward spiral that's painful but fascinating to watch.

The performances of Kate and Leo are arguably the strongest of each of their careers. There's, objectively, nothing to criticize about them. So much pain and emotion flies between them that just watching the Wheelers exchange words is exhausting. Even though their characters are constantly hurling insults at each other, there's still an innate chemistry between them that makes them mesmerizing to watch on screen. DiCaprio's performance all but brought tears to my eyes as the husband who tries his very best to support his family, but is fed up with his mind-numbing job. His tense relationship with his counterpart only makes him all the more stressed and genuinely confused about how to fix the situation. April seems like more of the free spirit and although Frank cares for her, their values are starkly different. One particular scene that especially moved me was after a particularly bad episode with April, he comes downstairs to find her calmly cooking breakfast as though nothing even happened the night before. In response to April slinging an ""I hate you"" at him the previous night, he just looks at her and asks—something to the effect of—""you don't hate me, right?"" It's just a few, simple words, but they succeed in being the most poignant words spoken throughout the whole movie. It's great acting, and DiCaprio does not disappoint.

Kate Winslet has never been under appreciated as an actor, and rightfully so. Every movie she's in, romantic, dramatic, funny, what have you, she always plays the part. She has mind-blowing versatility, and Revolutionary Road is no exception. April would be easy to make into the villain. After all, she's upstaging her family in pursuit of a pipe dream, she has unrealistic expectations of her husband, and she's overzealous (arguably, to a fault) when it comes to the chase of said dreams. Winslet, though, is able to make a sympathetic plight for April. Although a severely flawed character, she's still humanized and relatable. Not to mention, she's a powerhouse screen presence and she's so tapped in emotionally to her part that it's riveting.

The general consensus among critics and audiences is the not-so-cheery ending. One can't help knowing that something bad is coming considering the gloomy tone of the whole storyline, but thanks to DiCaprio and Winslet, the depressing plot is still watchable. Mostly due to the actors, Revolutionary Road may not have been a hit during awards season (whoever is responsible for DiCaprio not earning an Oscar nomination should be locked up), but I was glad I saw it. The directing (by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes) is precise enough to allow the actors to do what they do best and the source material (the novel by Richard Yates) is nothing to sneeze at. Hopefully, Kate and Leo will reunite in the near future to deliver the same gripping performances as this one.

My grade: B+",pos
Revolutionary Road,"trivia spoiler for Titanic, R U Kidding me?",10/5/2019,timmetje_1992,5-四月-09,"Why the f*** does the trivia of this movie contain a spoiler for Titanic? I never saw it and I assume the yellow line only warns for spoilers of the movie that the trivia belong to, g******it. Now I can never watch Titanic, unless my memory were to be erased. Movie disappointed me too, by the way. Revolutionary Road, that is, not Titanic, since that could never please me anyway. Giving away spoilers is very very dangerous and why doesn't IMDb warn about this? It warns about the spoilers of one movie, but not about the other. This really saddens me, why, why, why? Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all time, I would like to watch it and be mesmerized, but that's not gonna happen, is it? Because the trivia of Revolutionary Road on this site contains spoilers about Titanic.

Revolutionary Road,How sane or insane are we?,10/8/2019,harishprakashhp,17-二月-09,"If American Beauty questioned human morality, Revolutionary Road questions sainity. Richard Yates disturbing tale of human relationship has transcended into screen by Sam Mendes.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet who came together a decade ago for Titanic, play the role of the Wheelers, an outwardly happily married couple with two kids residing at Revolutionary Road.

In the first few minutes of the movie, the audiences get to see, Frank Wheeler and April eying each other, falling in love and then cut to the present, a few years later there is sea change in their lives. Frank hates his job as a salesman in a cubicle while April's dream to become an actress is a failure. Adding to this is the stress of their marriage falling apart.

And just like that April decides for them to get away from the emptiness and hopelessness encumbering their lives and start anew in Paris. She chalks out a plan to get herself a job there so that Frank can find what he really loves to do in life. All those close to them think it is the most unrealistic fantasy like idea, except for their land lady's lunatic son John Givings (Michael Shannon), who feels it's the sanest decision they had ever taken.

Just as things are looking upbeat for the couple, in terms of relationship, fate takes a different turn. Frank gets promoted and Alice is pregnant. From here the tale grows into a complex heart wrenching. With the Paris dream shattered, their life once again goes topsy-turvy. And mad man John with his deep insight hurting words to set a cascade of unpredictable reactions to follow.

Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are such a treat to watch. Di Caprio as a loving practical, responsible and once-in-a-while-going-astray husband, is especially good in the emotional scenes. Kate Winslet, yet again proves why she is the best actress on this planet. Michael will never be able to beat the Heath Ledger's insanity levels, but his very brief role getting nominated for the best supporting actor in the Oscars, speaks volumes.

The monotonous background score by Thomas Newman is just as haunting as the movie.

The movie is distressing in every right. It questions morality, fickleness of the human mind and its unpredictability. Who or what are we living for? For our own selves or for others? These will be the questions that will linger in your mind after watching this Mendes flick. He is a phenomenon, no doubt.",pos
Revolutionary Road,An ambitious try,10/7/2019,stensson,11-二月-09,"The American dream again and has that dream ever been more strong than during the 50s? However that was, this is about the couple who tries to escape it. Or maybe they are escaping the escape? Di Caprio and Winslet, especially Winslet, are competent. But the acting is anyhow too melodramatic sometimes. This is not people of the 50s. And it's not neither film nor theater.

But it is a serious try to illustrate complicated feelings. Not silly at all, but the ambitions are higher than the result. If we're still waiting for the Great American Novel, we've already got the Great American Movie. But is isn't this one.

Revolutionary Road,"Can April and Frank work it out? They are so weak in a world where people have departed from their ""state of nature"" (to quote Rousseau here).",10/7/2019,anguillanneuf,7-二月-09,"Being 20 something, I don't want to appear too smart on this subject simply because I am not. However, I don't understand the silent smile that Mr. Howard Givings' wears at the end of the movie. Is that the expression of human wisdom? Is that signifying a kind of reconciliation with the unhappiness in life? Is that telling us to give up our true desires just to be living from hand to mouth? I want to stop asking these questions for now because I have sensed an impasse just inches ahead. I am thinking about the couple in Michael Haneke's The Seventh Continent and another couple in Robert Bresson's A Gentle Woman. Having seen those two, I have to say Revolutionary Road is much easier to grasp, however, in a way, also not as thought-provoking as them.

Revolutionary Road,Scholastic desperation,10/7/2019,marioonline,5-二月-09,"I have heard a lot of people complaining about this movie being neglected by the Oscars for the major prizes. Although an Oscar nomination does not automatically translate into universally accepted excellence (see: The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, etc etc...), I do not see this lack of nominations as a tremendous injustice: this is movie is good, but not very good. I have not read the book it is taken from, so maybe its shortcomings are a direct consequence of the novel's...this depends on how faithful is the script, especially when it comes to dialogs and characters' interaction in general. The acting is good (Winslet's better than Di Caprio's but this does not come as a surprise) but some lines where really either over the top or trivial. A movie that claims to be a merciless depiction of how ugly a relationship can get cannot rely on trite clichés like a woman accusing a man of not being a man, or an ""Idiot savant"" who explicitly tells it like it is with his acute insights and tongue-in-cheek blabber. In many scenes of the movie I felt like the characters were explaining their inner world, in a very simple and clear way. Like in 5th grade. We're all grown up here, people. Let's move on. So, well done, but it could have been so much better. 7 out of 10.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"An impeccably staged, detached tragedy",10/5/2019,rjyelverton,4-二月-09,"Why do we not sympathize with the Wheelers? ""Revolutionary Road"" is a tragedy, but we find little sympathy for the Wheeler family who bring about their own dissolution. If you cannot connect with a tragic figure than you are merely a voyeur. For the audience, there's no catharsis and no tears. We are merely clinicians or scientists, observing. Cold and detached. If the Wheelers were placed in the same setting with the same stimuli, the results would be the same. What lesson do we learn from this film? The Wheelers should never have gotten married.

Part of the problem is with director Sam Mendes detached style. The lighting in his scenes is just so. The set dressing, make-up and costuming impeccable. He can put together a beautiful image with the best of them. (See the beautiful, but similarly detached ""Road to Perdition."") There are some nicely constructed moments in ""Road"" involving parades of faceless businessmen coming to and from work. At key moments, Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) nearly disappears into the cloud of drones or stands apart from them. Winslet and DiCaprio deliver intense performances that were undoubtedly taxing--there will be shouting--but we are always watching them from afar.

There is an invigorating moment, late in the film, when Mendes switches to a hand-held camera--almost always used to amp up/signal a rise in tension--and lets his film go a little. We are suddenly there with Frank and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) and the film jangles the nerves. Distractingly, the score for this so similar to the one created by Thomas Newman for Mendes' ""American Beauty"" that you might swear the two were one in the same. ""Revolutionary Road"" is a bit of a curiosity. An impeccably staged, detached tragedy.

(Michael Shannon is getting some awards season notice for his role as the film's Jester. He's good in this, but even better in this year's deep-fried, low budget drama ""Shotgun Tales."" He was also the best part of the adequate Oliver Stone film ""World Trade Center."")",pos
Revolutionary Road,Deep down in one's soul,10/9/2019,mcsawley,2-二月-09,"There is much more to this film than a simple story of selfish or disillusioned people. This is about two persons who cannot make up their minds about where should their life path take them and who are totally mesmerized by the ""hopeless emptiness"" of living. An stunning performance of actors, playing characters devoured by strong feelings, inflamed hope, resentments and frustrations. The idea of having their hidden, deep thoughts deciphered by the lunatic neighbour, is a very strong point for the film.

Not often have I seen a film in which the innate difficulty at communicating between man and wife - the way we look at common projects, failures and achievements- have been so crudely carved and depicted. Yet, for most of us, fortunately, affection, luck or giving up, maybe even sometimes common sense allows to heal the wounds. The final scene illustrates on a light tone the difficulty of communicating between spouses, the man choosing his own way to not have to continue the dialog with his life partner.

Franck and April are passionate people, and common sense is not something you want to hear about when you have a passion. Their drama is that they do not know what they are passionate about, they cannot find what makes them ""special"".

The same director as ""American Beauty"". In a sense, the characters in that film were totally unconscious, even if behaving in an irresponsible way, of what was going to happen; they could not think about the unthinkable ending. In this story, you can perceive a good deal of willingness to hurt and to be hurt; just to feel something, finally.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Interesting movie, Better performances",10/7/2019,butchfilms,2-二月-09,"I thought this was going to be a more entertaining movie, but what make it worths to watch it are the performances of DiCaprio, Winslet and Shannon.

I can't understand how Brad Pitt was nominated for the Oscar and not DiCaprio when he has a much better performance. The better moments of the movie are the conversations and discussions between the 2 leadings, the scenes where Shannon appears are very good too, the supporting characters are entertaining. I think the weak point of the movie is its length (119 minutes), I think 105 minutes would have been better because some moments the film is a little slow and boring.

Frank and April are a young married couple who are tired of their boring life, that's why they decide to go to Paris and live there, but when Frank gets a better job and salary offer at his work, he will have doubts of leaving, that's when really serious problems begin in this couple's relationship .....

This movie is recommended specially for adult people who like dramas.",pos
Revolutionary Road,"Thank you for this movie,",10/10/2019,id-57,1-二月-09,"What a great movie, well thought off, extremely strong acting and a brilliant direction and script.

Everyone can see him/her self in this movie, no matter where you come from or what state your in, the messages in the movies are so blunt and strong it's almost hurtful, but we need a slap to pause at our life and look deeper in our decisions and way of life. Prepare to take a big slap, but don't be arrogant and pretend your not like that in some way or another, it's not your life alone.

There are strong messages in every sentence and angle in this movie, and the actors really go far to make it real, the whole movie act as an unmasked picture of our lives, no BS and no cosmetics, just plain life. Before i watched this movie i didn't understand why the movie was shot to look like it's happening in the 50's, I'm glad they did, because we think we're different and we're not, we're still there, like our parents and many generations before us, and we still make the same mistakes. Kudos to the whole staff for such a wonderful film, i hope everyone will like it as much as i did.",pos
Revolutionary Road,What if the American Dream is a nightmare?,10/8/2019,Red-125,1-二月-09,"Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Sam Mendes, is a great vehicle for Kate Winslet. Winslet is an actor whom I truly admire. A critic has called her the ""Meryl Streep for her generation,"" and I agree. Leonardo DiCaprio does a reasonable job as her husband, although for most of the film his expression varies between a scowl and a dark scowl.

Frank Wheeler is living the 1950's American dream--well-paying job, beautiful wife, two kids, shiny Oldsmobile, house in Connecticut. April Wheeler is living the dream as well. It's true that her career as an actor has gone nowhere, but she loves her husband and her kids and their beautiful home.

Except. . . Frank says he hates his job, and April thinks they should be looking down on the life they're living. They know they're better than other people they see around them. Her thought--let's go to Paris where I can work as a secretary and you can find yourself.

The problem with the script is that there's a major scene missing. We're led to understand, in context, that Frank had great dreams for himself, and April shared those dreams. That point is never made clear--when did they decide they could do great things, and what talents did Frank have that people around him didn't have? (We also never see Winslet, as April, acting. Early in the film, we're shown a scene where she's acted in a community play which, apparently, was horrible.)

The film contains some sub-plots, which basically serve as filler. Frank has a dalliance with a secretary, one of their friends is in love with April, and a mentally ill man is the only person who both sees the truth, and is able to tell the truth about what he sees.

The strength of the film is in Winslet's acting, and in the basic question: Is the perfect life really the perfect life? If it isn't perfect, what then?",pos
Revolutionary Road,Not revolutionary but interesting adult drama,10/8/2019,bobbyelliott,1-二月-09,"I'm a fan of Sam Mendes' direction and his style in clear in this movie, which is one of the film's strong point. There are other strengths: the acting is good by just about everyone involved but especially Kate Winslet (who does a much better American accent than the usual grating attempt); the topic is interesting (marriage problems); and the treatment is mature. And there are some genuinely deep moments in the movie that any married couple will relate to. Mendes does suburban angst better than anyone in cinema but his theatrical roots show at times with the staged scenes and clunky dialogue.

DiCaprio just can't carry off heavy roles - he looks like a wee boy in a grown-up's suit. The film is based on a Sixties' book and inherits some of the sexism from that era (but not intentionally or ironically). And, at the end of it, it doesn't say a great deal... except that marriage is not the idealised perfection that romantic novels lead you to believe.

But for the acting, interesting topic, cinematography, music and atmosphere, it's well worth catching and markedly better than most movies. Watching this movie is time and money well spent.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road: It's a one way street,10/7/2019,Red_Flag,31-一月-09,"Stop, before you even attempt to read this review I must warn you. If you are currently engaged, if you are in a happy relationship and especially if your newlyweds, stop reading now. This movie is designed to repel you. This may just be the most depressing movie of 2009. An anti-marriage campaign if I ever saw one. What sets it apart from other movie with the same attitude (The Heart of Me) is that its flawlessly done. Sam Mendes movie looks and sounds gorgeous and not once does it put a foot out of line. What Revolutionary road fails to do however is maker you like it. Its wonderfully made sure, but the subject material is so banal its almost impossible to sit through.

With ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes's previous film, we were given at the very least a glimmer of hope. The theory behind that movie was that even in the last year of your life you can live a lifetime over. Here, none of these characters are given a glimmer of hope; in the end it all feels worthless.

It's a movie for a specific audience, an audience I thought I catered to, with this movie however I even had to think twice about staying. It's not that it's a bad movie however, as I said it's wonderfully made. Look as hard as you want your won't find a flaw, its simply a case of the execution overruling the premise, a rare feat but true in this case. Its seems that from the get go this story fails to do justice to the elements Sam Mendes incorporates into it.

These elements, done so flawlessly, include two riveting performances from Kate Winslet and Leonard DiCaprio both playing tortured middle class people living in 1950's America. Titanic shipmates Kathy Bates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet step onboard for director Sam Mendes' tale of suburban malaise in 1950s-era Connecticut. Adapted from the classic 1961 novel by author Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different.

They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.

The score is executed with the same pin price precisions of that used in American Beauty, it feels as if somebody has spent a great deal of time on it. As does this film itself, Sam Mendes may have been so busy with the elements of his movie he may not have realised that the premise he was making his movie on felt a little lifeless. For better use of the word, a downer. Revolutionary Road is beautifully made, but it won't make your day.

Verdict: A film crafter so beautifully it would be a shame to pass it up now. Sam Mendes directional style shine through the dim premise and while it's unlikely to leave any audience member happy, simply due to its depressing nature, it may just enlighten some. You come out knowing you have seen some great performances, brilliant direction and beautiful cinematography, but it is just not a film you love. For my overall rating I give Revolutionary Road 3/5.",neg
Revolutionary Road,"Revolutionary Road is a depressing, tragic, immaculate, powerful force of a film.",10/9/2019,dj_xand325,31-一月-09,"Sam Mendes shocked us in 1999 with his magnificent study of American Suburbia with American Beauty. He's come back onto our screens with Revolutionary Road, a shocking retelling of Richard Yates' novel. It tells the story of the seemingly perfect family, the Wheelers. They have 2 children, live within a very respectable neighbourhood, financially secure and seem externally to have a very loving relationship. Yet with Mendes (like American Beauty), nothing is ever as it seems and we see how Frank and April's relationship becomes jaded, empty and hopeless. April is a failed actress who spends her days tending for the house while Frank has a job that he can't stand. They're relationship is dysfunctional and Mendes maximises the devestating effect of this with the flashbacks of when they were newly weds which creates a profound contrast.

Frank and April have an opportunity to break out of this monotonous, vacuous lifestyle they live in by moving into Paris yet the arrival of a pregnancy and higher job hopes for Frank leads to this immature dream deteriorating which leads to a tragic conclusion.

This film is beautiful, visually and contextually. It presents the superficiality of American Suburbia that covers up the empty, cold lives these people lead. Dicaprio and Winslet were the highlight of the film. Their performances were sensational, Dicaprio's tour de force performance was vehement, passionate yet at times poignant. Winslet's performance was whimsical and truly flawless. The most important thing was the chemistry of these two characters, this withstood outstandingly throughout the film, which was of course helped by Winslet and Dicaprio's partnering in Titanic around a decade ago.

Winslet and Dicaprio reunite in Mendes' beautiful film about the crushing effects of post WW2 American Suburbia. American Suburbia has been given another swipe by Sam Mendes, and hes looking as bold and brilliant as ever 9/10",pos
Revolutionary Road,"beautiful, simple movie",10/10/2019,alshehri,31-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road is absolutely one of the best movies in 2008.Sam Medes succeeds again dealing with real life issues using two of the best actors in their generation.

Leonardo DiCaprio now has his print on Hollywood map.His captivating performance is probably the best male performance this year and his best(after The Aviator of course). Kate Winslet's performance is as good as her co-star.(shame on the Academy for snubbing them).At least Michael Shannon got a nomination he deserved.

It's dark drama presents painful reality.Thus,it may not be interesting to the young audience who wants light movie.

Revolutionary Road,The Big Bourgeois Trap,10/9/2019,swillsqueal,31-一月-09,"Wage-slaves tend to reproduce the lives which their parents lived, with minor changes of location and personages. It's also true that some young adults swear that they'll live life differently. There's an urge to avoid a meaningless existence. There is that youthful Kerouac-like urge to escape the Big Bourgeois Trap and instead, to jump in the car, put the peddle to the metal and be free.

Willy Loman was trapped. Arthur Miller wrote his play ""Death of a Salesman"", revealing the life of a tired, forgotten wage-slave near the end of life's road; loyal to his bosses, disloyal to his wife, while lying to his kids and at the same time supporting them financially through his tireless journeys for love and money. It's more than ironic that Elia Kazan directed 742 performances of ""Death of a Salesman"" in which Lee J. Cobb played the empty, hopelessness characterized in Willy. Ironic why? Because, among other things, Kazan's granddaughter has a significant role, playing Milly in ""Revolutionary Road"". Ah, but that's another story. See the film.

Willy Loman's world is just one aspect of this 1955-centered movie which can be mined by the mindful. There are so many others, including references to the movie version of Edward Albee's George and Martha in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". Ah yes, the 'bickerings' you say. Ah yes, the secrets, lies and use of sex as a weapon in the struggle between males and females in marriage. Ah, but there's even more to ""Revolutionary Road"" than this.

""Revolutionary Road"" is about the desire for freedom, nay, the instinct for freedom which is constantly being stomped down within the Big Bourgeois Trap from the time you are a terrible two until you've finally grown up and realized that you must be an adult and conform. Either that or die or become a hobo or be thrown in an insane asylum as the mathematics Ph.d. John Givings has been in ""Revolutinary Road"". John (played excellently by Michael Shannon) is that kind of Francis Farmer non-conformist who has not grown out of his child-like bluntness, ergo, he must be shocked to keep from shocking others. (Was he thrown in the asylum by his ever loving mother, played by Kathy Bates?) He blurts out truths, even within proper, safe social settings. He blurts them out like the machine gun fire one might face as a soldier during WWII. Frank Wheeler (Di Caprio) has seen this kind of truth before. At first, he and April recognize it and embrace it. Frank was a soldier, facing death in the WWII, which in 1955 had only ended ten years before. It was at that moment of life or death truth, he confesses to his wife April (Kate Winslet), that he felt the most alive, even though he was frightened. And April, whose love for her husband has been challenged by the hum-drum life of housewifery in the safe, leafy suburbs of NYC, confesses that she felt the same, existential awakening when she first experienced love making with Frank, back when they were young and on their own revolutionary road away from the ordinary lives which their parents had lived. The moment of this mutual recognition leads to a very steamy sex scene in the kitchen. Surely, you are interested now, dear readers.

The thing is that Frank is now a salesman for the same company which employed his father and he sees the death trap of a Willy Loman lifestyle descending over him, much as Willy's children saw it destroy their father. April sees it too. But hell, they've now decided to chuck it all, the relative security of life in the burbs of the 50s to take a chance on April in Paris. Yes, to move the two kids and their married lives ('the whole catastrophe', to quote Zorba) to Europe where existentialist juices are imagined to be flowing as freely as the espresso at the Cafe des Deux Maggots. The prospect of finally 'finding themselves' blooms somewhere, just over the rainbow shrouded Atlantic Ocean. Yes, the chimes of freedom are flashing again after some years of marriage with its triumphs and disappointments. Their instincts have been re-awakened from the doldrums of everyday life in the 50s with the father kissing the wife a la Dagwood and taking off to bring home the bacon from the office which Mr. Dithers runs and the kids, of course, running around in the yard shouting, ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"".

In the beginning of their relationship, both April and Frank really want this freedom from the Big Bourgeois Trap and they believe that this urge places them in another league from their peers. This urge sets them on fire with love for each other. Others see the spirit in them too, the ones who have already grown-up, conforming to the lies required of fear-filled wage-slaves in everyday life. They want to touch it; but are ultimately cowed by their social conditioning, rationalized as,""familial responsibilities"". When Frank is offered a big promotion in sales (he will be an ad-man for the then, cutting edge exotic machines called computers), he is tempted to accept and give up on pulling up stakes in burbs and moving to Paris with April.

April is not of the same mind. She is still star struck with the idea of getting out, perhaps escaping to the sheltering skies of Tangiers with Paul Bowles, instead of ending up as yet another archetypal Lucy Jordan, wife to that ultimate tragic archetype of capitalism, Willy Loman. Thus, lovers become haters and the road to revolution in their lives turns into its opposite: death on the installment plan in middlebrow suburbia, complete with those occasional visits to a reputable psychiatrist, just so one can remain safely shrink-wrapped in the Big Bourgeois Trap.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road,10/10/2019,edhubie,30-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road was a great film in many aspects. First the powerful acting delivered by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. Second the dialogue was absolute genius. Finally the story is so unbelievably told that it leaves you speechless to what you're actually seeing on screen. It baffles me that this movie didn't get more nominations and Leo and Kate needed nominations for this movie, but this isn't the first time I've seen Leo get shafted by the Oscars. The story of two people only in love with the idea of each other, getting married having children and trying to do the right thing with everything that's wrong finally clashes and is told so brilliantly and believably in this movie. This movie was highly underestimated by the Oscars. It was wonderful in many ways and Sam Mendes yet again brings us another great movie that leaves us thinking about it long after the credits end.

Revolutionary Road,Up there with the greats,10/10/2019,Chris_Docker,31-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road is an exquisite piece of serious melodrama. Much of the emotional depth relies on what we don't see. Don't hear. And don't have explained. Characters control their feelings rather more than American cinema would usually like them to. That, will hopefully put off many a teenage cinemagoer who would be bored rigid by a lack of explosions. A lack of over-acting. A lack of subject matter one can relate to without at least one failed marriage, one relationship you get up for but would rather not, and a long period where the choice between emptiness and hopelessness stretches out like a life sentence. Di Caprio an Winslet are reunited. This time, it's not Titanic that fails to reach its destination, it's the American Dream.

Take a moment to recall a time when you had something all figured out. How everything would be just perfect. If only people would do it your way? Trapped inside individual visions of perfection, Frank and April communicate at emotional cross-purposes. They are an idyllically good-looking young couple in 1950s Connecticut, buying their first house. Expecting their first child. The world is opening up to them. Have you been there perhaps? Just a few adjustments. Tweak each other's views.

What do you do when you love someone and they won't see sense? Frank tries to disabuse April of her childish notions of being an actress, something she has trained for. She's awful at it anyway, he's right. Why can he not see that this is not the way to be supportive and loving? April slips jarringly from being the perfect wife to putting on perfection as a show. Then she has a bright idea. Let's start again. In Paris. Frank will have time to find what he really wants to do in life instead of an advertising job he hates. Deep down he loves her. If she can only just re-kindle that.

The problem with pretending to be nice is just that. If you have to pretend, then deeper issues are not right. Sooner or later they will come to the surface. Stuff about the symbolic nature of the title (the street where Frank and April live is called Revolutionary Road) could fill pages. But the film's strength is that any deeper meanings are secondary. There is sometimes a great temptation (certainly by this writer) to interpret films within a social context, to analyse their moral agenda. While this provides intelligent gratification of consciousness, it can blind us to the power of film as autonomous art, the precise use of a dramatic device for its own sake, the carefully crafted harmony of costume, lighting, sets, inflection and intonation, and the many formal techniques unique to cinema among the arts.

Winslet is here most diva-like, more self-assured than in many of her flamboyantly emotional parts. She delivers her lines with scalpel-like precision, and at last cuts the profile of an actress destined to become legend. Di Caprio is still underestimated as an actor in my opinion. Here, he plays off Winslet with the fire of a young Brando. As they throw emotional punches at each other, they are like two five-star boxers. A surgical jab to weeping wounds which hide tears. Pain inflicted without breaking rules. The cut and thrust of barbed words eliciting the worst. Is change possible without destruction? Bring on a neighbour's son, a mathematics Ph.D certifiably unsocial after repeated electric shock treatment to 'fix' him. Now a Village Fool like those of legend, who can speak the truth that no-one dares. Nowhere is such an occasionally theatrical device deployed more scathingly than with Michael Shannon's character, John Givings. A man who is past caring, towering over Frank and April physically and intellectually, he shreds any illusions we dare hold for their sake.

Perhaps I am wrong about teenage audiences. Some did walk out. But I remember Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. One of the first 'adult' themed films I saw as a young lad. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, bickering incessantly, and pointlessly showing off encyclopaedic command of words just to needle each other. I had to make myself sit through it. But the film made a deep impression and I look back on it now as a classic. I hope some young viewers will have the same experience with this Revolutionary Road.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Back in the Gray Flannel Days Before Mankind Discovered the Clitoris,10/8/2019,Hick_N_Hixville,29-一月-09,"After seeing yet another existential evocation of dystopian lives in 1950s suburbia (try the far more campy melodrama, Far From Heaven , or the far more gentle satire, Pleasantville, for a set of comparisons) it is obvious why the next step in American cultural evolution following Frank Lloyd Wright's inspired masculine tract house angularity involved both the ""Feminine Mystique"" and the ""Hite Report."" The sex in these 'burbs was just god-awful. Dicaprio's office stud was, at best, a six to seven pump chump fighting to beat a soft boiled egg timer when he played kitchen man to Winslet's unfulfilled housewife. Not surprisingly, she cheated to find better, but the guy next door was a truly pitiful front seat three stroker, if that. Did people of this type during this time period really screw so industrially? I mean I know the proverbial back seat drive-in movie thing was likely a fast, furtive and mostly clothed affair, but if this movie makes any statement about the banality and hopelessness of these characters' predicament, it is in the bump and grind of their everyday lives, or the lack of any to be precise. These well-suited and fedora clad men had won the war, then came home to fight meaningless memo battles within art deco wood and frosted glass foxhole versions of Dilbert's future cubicle hell. They wound up all pea and no cock, and their poor drab hens paid the real price.

I can easily picture Eddie Haskell as a selfish and quick lout bumbling about darkly in the back seat of a Studebaker between double creature features, but. I wonder if this is what it was like in Ward and June Cleaver's bedroom, or in their kitchen when Wally and Beaver were off somewhere being all American boys?

(Curious Note: Actor Dylan Baker, who plays DiCaprio's cubicle inmate at work, strikingly resembles the model for the father subject in the infamous 1930s anti-Depression propaganda billboard, ""World's Highest Standard of Living, There is No Way Like the American Way."" This billboard was made world famous through Margaret Bourke-White's classic ironic black and white photograph showing poor African-American flood victims lining up for relief in front of one in Louisville, KY in 1937.

Revolutionary Road,Powerful stuff.,10/9/2019,TOMASBBloodhound,29-一月-09,"All right, let's get it out of the way. I counted about four Titanic references. How many did you count? The casting of Bates, Winslet, and DiCaprio, the steamer trip to France, making love in the vintage car, and the close-up of Leo's hands while drawing a diagram in front of Kate at the breakfast table. Despite the fine quality of this film, I could not help but notice these things, and I'm sure most other people will, too.

Revolutionary Road is another attempt by director Sam Mendes to show a darker side of the typical suburban American marriage. Though this film won't quite garner the awards that American Beauty did, it is still a film of that same quality. The film deals with a young suburban couple during the 1950s who are coming to a crossroads in their lives. Frank works in the city doing an office job that is meaningless to him. While he's away each day, his wife April tends the house. It is a nice house for a young couple. They have two children who are often off screen and are treated more or less like additional furnishings of the home. Any depth of relationship between the Wheelers and their children is not explored in any way. Early in the film we see April participate in a community playhouse type of production that is universally panned by all that see it. This scene is there to show us how her dreams of becoming an actress are forgotten very early in her adulthood. One day April suggests to Frank that the two of them give up their stale suburban existence and move to Paris. She can do secretarial work while he figures out what he really wants to do with his life. Pretty much everyone they know pans the idea, thinking it foolish. But Frank and April at this point think the joke's on all of them. They are really serious about this Paris thing, and everyone who doubts their dream is simply lame and emotionally dead. Just before the move, two big developments send reality crashing down on Frank and April. Frank is offered a considerable promotion from work, and April learns she is pregnant. From here on, the whole facade of their marriage and even reality itself comes crashing down on them. One argument after another tears the two farther and farther apart. Until finally, tragedy strikes.

The film kind of took me by surprise. I, as a proud life-long bachelor expected to relish in their emotional pain an arguments. But as the film went on, and things got more bleak I found myself really feeling bad and caring for these two. I WANTED them to find an understanding and be happy. But once everything was out on the table, the two had clearly burned any bridges they could have used to come together once more. Kate is wonderful as always, and this was Leo's best work since that big film that made them famous. And Oscar nomination not withstanding, I felt the mentally challenged character was a little bit contrived. Sure, he's good in the role, but I just didn't buy the role itself. That it took a crazy man to be honest with the Wheelers... I just didn't buy that they'd even let him in their front door. Even as a favor to the real estate lady. There are affairs to be had by both Frank and April, but they are not the cause of strife. Just symptoms. I'm sure most couples of today would divorce for even 10% of the problems between these two people. Maybe their biggest mistake was ever thinking they were special in the first place. 9 of 10 stars.

Revolutionary Road,"Devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her family, hard to take but easy to admire",10/10/2019,inkblot11,29-一月-09,"April Wheeler is one very desperate housewife in the 1950's. She married her attractive husband, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), thinking his unconventional ways and casual attitude toward his jobs would result in a less-than-ordinary life. However, once April got pregnant with her daughter, and her younger son, Frank changed. He started to work for the same staid Manhattan firm where his father had toiled for years and he moved his family into a lovely home in suburban Connecticut. Consequently, April is in a state of slow suffocation, for although she appears to be the typical, all-American housewife, she is not. One day, April greets Frank with a big smile and a nifty family party for his 30th birthday. That's because April has hatched a plan. Why can't the Wheelers move to Paris, which Frank saw and admired during his military years, and which would surely hold a bevy of new sights and sounds? Frank would not even have to work, April would work as a secretary for a government agency and Frank can figure out what he really wants to do in life. Caught up in April's enthusiasm, Frank agrees to the new venture. But, then April finds out she is pregnant with the couple's third child. What will happen to April's dreams of a new life? This is a devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her unhappiness with a picture-postcard family existence. April's problems are compounded by the fact that she lives in the 1950's when women were just beginning to break out of the typical homemaker ""mold"". In the 21st century, many couples grow apart as they grow older and there is not as much of a stigma to ending a marriage and starting all over again. Yet, Frank is a sympathetic character, too, for he is not the money-driven businessman that many folks are, but he does have a family to support and his feet are more rooted in reality than April's. The result is that the Wheelers are a couple in desperate need of serious counseling but they don't get it and tragedy ensues. As the principal actors, Winslet and DiCaprio are incomparable in their difficult roles. Winslet embodies the beautiful, unhappy April as few actresses could but DiCaprio, despite receiving no similar award nominations, is every bit her equal in his part as the torn-in-two directions husband. All of the supporting cast, from Kathy Bates to Michael Shannon and the rest, are absolutely marvelous, too. The scenery in suburban Connecticut is lovely, the costumes well chosen, and the production values are first rate. As for the story and its direction, by Sam Mendes, they are monumentally powerful and sad. Not all of us are cut out for the ""normal"" family life and to feel caught in a life style you don't love is a major downer. Therefore, this is not the film to see if you are in a state of depression or are experiencing any difficulties in your own family relationships, for it will thoroughly demoralize you. But, if you are a movie fan who yearns for a film to ""shake you to your bones"", with a strong story and great depth, this one just can't be missed. Mendes, as in American Beauty, is a master at showing the dark side of anyone's seemingly sunny life.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Beautiful Movie.,10/10/2019,WendyAndBashir,26-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road is a beautifully directed film done by Sam Mendes. Highly Acclaimed director of American Beauty. This movie struck me in the heart. It made me sad just to think about being in the position of Frank and April Wheeler. Having to live through life like that. Also with 2 kids. This is a truly heartfelt and emotional piece done by to amazing Actors.

Kate winslet- This is truly a career defining performance. She is won of the few actors who can show so much emotion and expression such a little look. The character April Wheeler is a very complicated character to comprehend.she is a truly confused and emotional mother. Kate Winlset plays her perfectly. So subtle but yet so powerful. Kate winslet was snubbed for her performance

Leonardo Dicaprio- Give this man an Oscar already! his performance in this film was fantastic. Why he did not get a nomination for this is beyond me. Frank wheeler, is a very confused person. He loves his wife but yet hates her at the same time. So much confusion in his life can often lead to emotional breakdowns which Dicaprio plays perfectly.

And might I mention Micheal Shannons performance? Micheal shannon- Micheal Shannon plays Helen Givings mentally ill son John. Going to this movie i would have never suspected such a raw and honest performance. Good Luck at the Oscars.

This movie is a flawless piece of cinema and is truly one of the best in years. Despite being snubbed in the Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Picture categories at the Oscars, this movie will go on to be a memorable piece of work done by an extraoridinary group of people.

Revolutionary Road,The American Dream,10/10/2019,stratogod,26-一月-09,"I usually do not post in forums, comments, etc... but I felt like I needed to after I saw this influential film and the type of feedback it was receiving. The feeling this movie gave me is something I have never felt in my life. Sam Mendes does a wonderful job directing while both he and Justin Haythe adapt this Richard Yates novel into a screenplay... however, the biggest element that shined in this film was the superb acting.

I don't consider myself a movie guru, but I do know a lot about the general aspects that build a powerful film. Revolutionary Road was a complete outlier, as it struck chords I didn't even know I was aware of. I have been married for almost 3 years... I love sociology and I have written papers on American Institutionalism... which this move depicts very well in the 1950s. It was a time of change, a time of conformity, and time of confusion for Americans....

The two main characters in this movie - April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leo Dicaprio) had a connection that only deep lovers may understand... I know many argue otherwise... but seriously... if both you and your spouse lift yourselves above the 'Marriage' institutionalism ideal... you will begin to realize, that we are both just two humans questioning a sociological constructed ideal called 'Marriage'. The way Mendes depicted this movie was flawless... there were moments I felt completely disconnected with reality and had almost a sense of eeriness watching the couple interact during their ongoing conflict in the film.

The movie probably won't appeal to the masses... but if you are aware of socially constructed ideals and institutionalism, you will find this film hard to forget. I think both actors did a wonderful job... I have never seen such emotional and flawless acting. Leo definitely got snubbed for the Oscars... I never really watch the Oscars, but the fact that he didn't' even get nominated has sincerely frustrated me.

Watch this film. Truly a quality piece that will show you an ongoing battle within every marriage... it is just a matter of how tolerant and willing you are to play 'the game'. I admire the couple for their willingness to be free-spirited and aware of their predicament. Marriage is socially constructed... it is NOT natural... despite the advantages, it just isn't. It is a form of social control delivered by a higher agenda that we may never come to realize.

We still fall victim to love though, and this movie depicts the struggle and realization of this institutionalized cage of marriage and individualism.

Revolutionary Road,A very fine movie,10/8/2019,richard-1787,25-一月-09,"The trailers for this looked intriguing, and while I know they can be deceptive, I went anyway, having been very impressed by Kate Winslett's performances in other movies (Hamlet, The Reader, Sense and Sensibility).

Still, I was not prepared for as good a movie as this turned out to be.

Winslett and Di Caprio give first-rate performances, particularly Winslett. Yes, there is some shouting, but that's not acting, it's shouting. Anyone can do that. Both these actors say far more with their faces, their expressions, than they do with their shouting. They telegraph pages of script into glances, as the best actors do. Winslett at the end is absolutely devastating to watch as she prepares for what she clearly sees as a fatal act.

The directing is very fine as well. The scene of the abortion is perfectly and most movingly filmed, moving at just the right speed, cloaked in just the right hushed almost silence, with discretion and respect. It would have been so early to over-dramatize it, but Mendes does not, making it all that much more devastating.

There are points where one might want more elucidation. Why does di Caprio's character oppose the abortion? What is he thinking, married to the very beautiful Winslett, when he seduces the less attractive office clerk? There are other questions for which I might have liked at least suggestions of answers.

Still, I don't need every i to be dotted and every t to be crossed to enjoy a movie, as I most certainly did this one. It is a very moving story about a woman trapped in a life that does not satisfy her, surrounded by others who cannot understand her feelings and seem to be very satisfied with what she has. In that respect, it recalls the middle story of The Hours, though I found this more subtle and very much more moving.

The Academy may have overlooked it for best picture, but you should not.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Revolutionary Road hardly revelatory,10/8/2019,moutonbear25,25-一月-09,"The drive from the train station is not that far. Once you get past the first stretch, home to local folk like plumbers, seamstresses and the like, you turn on to a quaint, quiet road. The house that will hopefully soon be the home to you and your children, present and future, sits atop its tiny slope, understated but proud. As you drive past the other homes, you see the people that inhabit them. The children run under sprinklers; the parents sit on their porches and enjoy their afternoon cocktails. They all look so happy, so home. This is what you need. This is what will make you happy too. This is Revolutionary Road. Only, it isn't really that. What it is really, is Sam Mendes' REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, and just like the pretty picture it paints, it isn't as revelatory as it inherently suggests nor does it bring the happiness you thought it might.

Mendes has been down this particular road before. In the Oscar winning, American BEAUTY, Mendes explored the trappings of suburban life. It was hardly revelatory when he did it then but screenwriter, Alan Ball's unique take on the subject made it feel fresh and relevant. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is based on Richard Yates' 1961 novel of the same name. It tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet), the lovely, new couple who have bought the aforementioned house at the end of Revolutionary Road and who bring with them the promise of youth and vitality. You see, the Wheeler's are special. Everyone has always said as much. Then they moved to Revolutionary Road. They made their house into a home and filled that home with two wonderful children. It was at this point that they realized that they may not truly be as special as everyone has always said, that perhaps they are not destined for anything greater than what they already have.

Leo and Kate are perfectly cast as the Wheeler's. More than ten years after TITANIC, the pair are together again and now everyone gets to see exactly what might have happened if the couple had survived the boat going down. (I trust I gave nothing away there.) And while there is nothing romantic about their reunion, they are REVOTIONARY ROAD's one true revelation. Winslet is remarkable. She is subtly but always at odds with herself inside. She wants to love her life, her husband, and on some level, she does. But she is also yearning and desperate to feel alive. DiCaprio is a bit shaky but while April's hand is less than reassuring, Winslet's hand lifts him and elevates his performance to nearly the same level as hers. To watch the two of them go back and forth between being hopeful for their futures and dismally resigned to a lifetime of unhappiness is a ride well worth taking and one that will certainly leave you dizzy by the time it comes to its harrowing close.

The problem with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is that Mendes seems more concerned in presenting the Wheeler's as a symbol for the greater point instead of allowing them to just be the relatable characters that they are. Frank and April are special. When we begin to buy into the idea that we are just like everyone else is when we become just like everyone else. When a film tries to make a point instead of just allowing the point to make itself is when a film takes on an importance it did not earn to start. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD could have been beautiful if it wasn't trying so hard to be the biggest house on the block.",pos
Revolutionary Road,great movie,10/9/2019,hacheurdeportos,25-一月-09,"When I sat down, I was wondering if the film I was here to see was just a remake of the magnificent ""American Beauty"". It isn't, Revolutionary road is much darker than its predecessor. For the last hour and a half, I couldn't look off the screen due to the intensity of the tragedy lived by this couple. The acting is very impressing particularly Leonardo DiCaprio who seems to be on top form. Kate Winslet wasn't good enough for the part but who is? Sam Mendes might have aimed a little too high with the female character, tortured and yet full of hopes. However, revolutionary road left a good impression on me. More than a remake of ""amercian beauty"" it's a sequel showing the troubles of the American society.

Revolutionary Road,Beautiful,10/10/2019,kyle_caldwell,24-一月-09,"Revolutionary Road has turned out to be a beautiful movie. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are perfect. Winslet plays April Wheeler HEAD on. and DiCaprio plays Frank Wheeler HEAD on. The two fit in just like puzzle pieces, and I'd have NO problem watching the movie again. Eagerly awaiting DVD release. ALTHOUGH---- this movie is not for everyone. You have to be in the mood to enjoy what Sam Mendes brings to the screen, but all around it's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful movie. It really is a triumph. I would VERY much so recommend this film to a friend. The events fit in and it's not hard to follow. Two amazing actors fit in beautifully and I'm short on words. You are left without word to describe. It's simply and truly beautiful

Revolutionary Road,Why Was Leo Shut Out of Awards???,10/8/2019,3xHCCH,24-一月-09,"The moment I heard that Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet had another movie together last year, I was stoked to watch it. When it earned both of them Golden Globe nominations and Kate won Best Actress, the more I wanted to watch this. So was it worth all the expectations? It turns out that this is a movie that is very uncomfortable to watch, especially as a couple. I watched this by myself, and I was thinking how it would be if my wife watched it with me. It portrays the story of Frank and April Wheeler, an idealistic young couple in the 1950s who live in a nice suburban house along Revolutionary Road. It traces their gradual emotional deterioration as a couple until it reaches an inevitable conclusion.

""Revolutionary Road"" was written by males, both the book and the script. I do not know about the book, but this movie was clearly written from the male point of view. I may sound sexist, but the character of April is so maddeningly irrational! I do not fully understand what she really wants. Though Frank is no saint himself, I empathize with the frustration of Frank as he tries to put up with the inexplicable moods of his wife.

Kate Winslet was predictably good in this role, which is very much reminiscent of her turn in another suburban housewife in ""Little Children"" last year. But for me, it was Leonardo di Caprio who totally succeeded in inhabiting his role of Frank. He was very good in delineating the exasperation Frank must be feeling being caught in such a depressing situation. I personally think Leo's portrayal of Frank had much more depth than Brad Pitt's Benjamin Button.

Kate Winslet had been quoted to say that she felt Leo di Caprio is her second husband (after director Sam Mendes) and they do look like a real married couple on screen. They really look good together there, so this makes the twisted storyline more heartbreaking to witness. I cannot believe that both of them were shut out of Oscar nominations.

The surprise Oscar nominee that seemingly came out of nowhere was Michael Shannon as Best Supporting Actor. Shannon played John Givings, a psychiatrically-ill math genius (and son of their landlady) who seemed to be the only person who could read the true thoughts of the embattled couple. He was only in two scenes, but he made his mark despite the limited screen time.

Sam Mendes gives us another tragic view of suburban America as he did in his Oscar-winning ""American Beauty."" As with ""Beauty,"" someone from my background would feel that everything seems over the top and unrealistic. Is it? People do not really talk or behave that way, do they?",pos
Revolutionary Road,"An emotional drama of life, love, showing the ups and downs of marriage proving it's a roller coaster ride.",10/7/2019,blanbrn,23-一月-09,"""Revolutionary Road"" an emotional drama and true it's not everyone's cup of tea still the film is well done and enough of an emotional drama to make it a watch for most especially married couples. Based and adapted from Richard Yates's novel director Sam Mendes takes a haunting and close look at marriage in 1950's Connecticut living the American dream in the suburbs. Meet April and Frank Wheeler(and again the chemistry between Winslet and Dicaprio is top notch maybe better than ""Titantic""). And they are the perfect young couple already with two young children. Both have unlimited promise April is an aspiring stage actress and Frank works a good job as a sales rep in the city. Both want big dreams to happen as they plan this after they move into their house on ""Revolutionary Road"". Yet as is so common with many couples they find the struggles of trust and most of all they feel trapped in a world of coded convention. Then it's the lying and the lack of faith and the behind the back cheating that surely enough leads to explosive problems for the Wheelers.

Yet April(in one of Kate's strongest performances)wants to start over again by leaving Connecticut for the confines of exotic Paris, France. As expected Frank's heart isn't in it and this leads to extremes especially for April as she will push herself over the edge. Overall I found this nothing great yet, it's worth a watch for the performance of Winslet especially who's very strong and a must see for Kate and Leo fans. Still most couples and especially married ones can relate well to this film as it's proves and shows married life is never easy especially when each see different paths it proves that marriage is clearly a roller coaster ride and no bed of roses.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Tour-de-force,10/10/2019,PWNYCNY,16-一月-09,"Move over George and Martha. Step aside Archie and Edith. Take a walk Oliver and Barbara. Here comes Frank and April. They are in the house. They have arrived and they mean business. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio give tour-de-force performances as a couple in conflict. Separately each character is likable, indeed wonderful, someone you would want to have as a friend. But together? Oh boy! Hold on to your hat because you'll be going on a ride, with a lot a bumps along the way. The director has taken what would otherwise have been little more than another hokey Hollywood potboiler and has raised it to the level of a classic. This movie is devoid of the mucky sentimentality that reduce such stories to sappy melodramas and instead deals forthrightly with the trials and tribulations associated with unmet needs. For one wants freedom and other wants security and they struggle to bridge that gulf. Ms. Winslet and Mr. DeCaprio were wonderful in Titanic. In this movie their performances are better. They're older but still retain that youthfulness which make them so appealing as actors. Also kudos to Kathryn Hahn who is one of the great comic character actresses. There is no bad guy or good guy, just people struggling to get through life and not be emotional frauds.",pos
Revolutionary Road,Like an autopsy of a relationship's corpse,10/9/2019,fertilecelluloid,9-一月-09,"Superb drama. Solid performances from Kate Winslett, Leonardo De Caprio, and the amazing Michael Shannon (one of filmdom's brightest hopes). Finally we have an American movie that dares to be honest about our lives (hopes, realities, and disappointments). ""Revolutionary Road"" (named after the street on which the characters live) is about the consequences of the choices we make. It's like an autopsy of a relationship's corpse -- only the corpse may still be breathing. Winslett and De Caprio are a couple who have succumbed to the so-called Amereican Dream of a house in the suburbs, kids, a job in the city, the usual bull. Winslett, smelling the rot beneath the floorboards, suggests they pack up and move to Paris. At first, De Caprio is all for a change. Then, ever so gradually, he's pulled back into the maelstrom of conformity and material promise. Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Justin Haythe, this raw collision of emotion remains consistent and true to its thesis. It offers no easy answers and isn't afraid to suggest that looking for answers is, in itself, problematic. Michael Shannon (so great in ""Before The Devil Knows You're Dead"") plays a mentally unpredictable man who sees the truth in what's going on between Winslett and De Caprio. The scenes where he single-handedly exposes the domestic fairytale for the crock it is are riveting and darkly funny. The end result is breathlessness. Mendes, who directed ""American Beauty"", has a talent for getting under the fascia of modern relationships. Here, he gets in there and manipulates the tissue until it bleeds. I loved every awkward moment.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Very good film has those Spielberg edges!,43656,rosscinema,18 March 2003,"At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Witty con man.,43748,jotix100,24 January 2003,"From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.

Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.

It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.

The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.

The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!,43687,camcmahon,31 March 2005,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.

Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.

I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.

However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400!

Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A lot of fun,43718,rbverhoef,8 June 2003,"While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.

I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.

The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Hard to believe its true,43687,mjw2305,17 January 2005,"I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.

It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.

It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10.

I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected. Leo plays the roll very well - give the man an Oscar already! I'm also thinking that Leo and Tom Hanks must have had a lot of fun filming this.

There were many famous actors and actresses in smaller rolls, which I liked. Perhaps some of them weren't so famous back in 2002 (I'm a bit too lazy to do the research at the moment) but seeing for example Ellen Pompeo and Jennifer Garner made me even more interested in the movie. Sometimes, movies with too many movie stars falls flat, for some reason. But this one certainly did not!

I'll definitely watch Catch Me If You Can more than once, more than twice! Loved it! <3",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Brill movie,43748,tvegalovebeck,1 February 2014,"I have just finished this movie and I can honestly say this is such a addictive movie!! once you have watched it you want to watch it over and over again!!! It is so funny how Frank passes himself off as a Pam Am pilot, a lawyer and a doctor all before he is 21. It is also a shame at the end where Carl tells Frank his father is dead and he doesn't believe it. It is funny at the beginning where Frank says he is dying and they take him to the hospital and he escapes and when he pretended to be a substitute teachers and calls himself Mr Abagnale and when he embarrasses the bully in front of the entire class!!!! He looks so cute as a boy!!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch It If You Can!,43687,MovieAddict2016,22 May 2003,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.

There's no real plot to go into, as I have already given it to you. Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.

Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.

I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.

The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role.

I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom.

If you just want to sit back and relax, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the perfect film for you. There's nothing all that special in the film, but the film kind of becomes special because it is so easy to watch. I recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"" to anyone who can enjoy a movie for what it is.

""Catch Me If You Can"" is a true popcorn flick, and maybe a little bit more.

4.5/5 stars -

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of the Best Movies Ever!,43748,jonathan_maroon,21 December 2013,"Catch Me if You Can is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is without a doubt the most underrated movie I have ever seen, especially with the all star cast it has.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, I know this might not be a popular vote but it is my favourite Spielberg film he has made.

The acting is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio is Oscar worthy, the fact that he didn't win Best Actor at the Academy Awards is amazing. Tom Hanks should have also received Best Supporting Actor and Steven Spielberg easily Best Director.

The script is one of the best scripts I have ever heard with some of the best dialogue ever. This movie is so funny. There is one scene towards the end were Tom Hanks is on the phone at the airport and you just see Leo and the stewardess' walk write by him, that had me on the floor laughing.

The ending is a perfect wrap-up to a perfect movie. 2 hours and 20 minutes of perfection

10 out of 10 stars.

Perfect!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch it if you can. I concur this movie is good.,43687,ironhorse_iv,16 April 2014,"Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story"" in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel & Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym ""Sean O'Reilly"" in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch. So catch it!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Don't you think that this movie is some kind of comedy?,43748,cherenedelvais,15 March 2006,"I think the movie is some kind of comedy. What would you say about that?

CatchMeIfYouCan,A light hearted yet polished film,43748,tuna-567,18 March 2014,"Going into this movie I was far from excited but I was utterly impressed by how this movie was executed. I knew the acting was going to be solid, you can never go wrong with Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, but they weren't the only superb things about this movie.

I was most astounded by how entertained I was during this film. It was brilliantly put together and wildly engaging.

To say I was surprised by the bouncy and vivacious screenplay is an understatement. There are scenes that are truly playful, lively and to my surprise, comedic. DiCaprio executes his perky and charming character flawlessly; he handles the vibrant persona with ease.

Do I even need to talk about Tom Hanks, I mean, we all know he's a remarkable actor.

Amy Adams has a small but very spirited role.

I came into this movie because of the actors and came out immensely delighted.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Going Places,43687,slokes,17 March 2006,"Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of ""Catch Me If You Can"" convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.

Indelible impressions are the sort of thing Frank Abagnale Jr. is good at, especially on the kind of phony checks that fool bank security. After his parents' divorce, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off in the Big Apple, making his way as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an assistant district attorney, all by means of fraudulent credentials and irresistible charm, not to mention the ability to stay one step ahead of the law, as represented by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).

A film that owes a debt to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Henry Mancini, ""Catch Me If You Can"" zips along on its own kind of sneaky charm, making us root for a character who would probably steal our life savings if given half a chance. At the same time, Spielberg avoids the pitfall of relativism by making sure Hanks as Hanratty keeps some amount of our rooting interest, however much we feel for this crazy kid with his naive belief that, like the mouse stuck in a bucket of cream, he can churn his bucket into butter and crawl out. It's a trick every bit worthy of the subject of this engaging tale.

From the opening moments of this film, featuring the best-ever Spielberg titles sequence (courtesy of Kuntzel-Deggas) and a very unusual but entrancing John Williams score that uses shushing sounds and finger snaps in place of his normal bombast, we realize we are in unusual territory for a Spielberg film. Right away, the theme of mistaken identity is introduced courtesy of a ""To Tell The Truth"" clip with host Joe Garagiola giving us three Frank Abagnales to choose from. We think we know which one he is, but we don't know as much as we think.

""You know why the Yankees always win?"" asks Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). ""It's because the other team can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes."" Walken, like Spielberg, works against audience expectations. Sure, he's a criminal, much what we expect from Walken, but he's got a good heart and a beguiling innocence. He believes in the American dream, even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry to get what he wants. Ultimately he's a victim, and a lesson to his son about why the straight and narrow isn't the way to go.

DeCaprio gives a solid, impressive performance, the best I've seen from him, playing a consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims. He finds the drama in his character, but also the comedy, in a film that shows Spielberg can be funny even when he involves us in a dramatic story. As we watch him fake his way aboard a cockpit, in an operating room, and even in a bedroom with an expensive callgirl played by Jennifer Garner, we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because he's succeeding.

The film also benefits from an immersive sense of the period in which it is set. Williams' score, along with the costumes and set design, present us with a view of the 1960s in its more sophisticated adult form, with Dusty Springfield and Frank Sinatra providing the music rather than the pop and rock acts we think of when we think of the time.

Does ""Catch Me If You Can"" go on longer than it should? Yes, I think tougher editing would have made it better. But I don't miss the mawkish attempts at uplift that pock Spielberg's lesser work, and the few poignant moments Spielberg throws in amid Abagnale's ruses ring true, especially a moment involving Frank and a little girl at a window near the end of the film that only Spielberg would try to get away with, because he can and does.

No, this is not a great film, just a very good one that might have slipped past a few people on its first release, as it did me. But give ""Catch Me If You Can"" a chance, and you may find this as a con you not only enjoy being taken by, but wish to experience again just to see how the masters, Abagnale and Spielberg, make their plays.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Good popcorn movie,43687,j_mongoose,24 May 2003,"An all-around good movie worth seeing. The plot is pretty basic: Quick-thinking kid from a broken family that he loved. He spent the next few years playing a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Think ""Pretender"" (the television series) but based on real events. The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe. An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru ""Gladiator"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Elizabeth"", and the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest]. So if your date is the discriminating-type, he/she should be able to sit through this movie and enjoy it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Caught me,43718,tomsview,13 May 2014,"One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.

He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Terminal"", ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich"".

Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.

The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.

It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.

Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her - we know something she doesn't.

Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.

There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.

The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.

Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or ""concurs"" with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.

I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,How meaningful the relation between parents to their children,43718,rony-790-339919,14 February 2014,"Everyone see movie and try to find out a part of stories that match their own, I mean personal life. Some stories more or less similar their personal experience. There are something inside of everyone that can not be reveal for some social reason. This thing and whatever it is like pain, past, situation, dream, mistakes all that you can not tell to someone makes you alone. You have everything around you that can make you happy related to material. But the thing inside of you makes you condemn. Because you can not say it out loud to others to accept. It is very hard to tolerate to bear. You know a simple incident could happen to many of you but you can't confess or sometime hide. When you find the similar thing also happen to someone else then you will find that it's not only you there are someone else who are like you. It seems like someone share your burden and feel much better. The story of the movie tell you that you are not alone and of-course teaches you not to take a role of the same mistake. The effect of the relation between parent on their children is very meaningful. It motivate your children.It's my personal aspect of seeing movies.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Great Film,43718,reissd2,4 December 2013,"Catch Me if You Can is a fast-past adventure, but a major departure from Spielberg's usual films involving dinosaurs and aliens. Spielberg shows in this film that he is more than capable of creating an entertaining film without the use of expensive special effects. The film is a biographical true crime film depicting the life of conman and counterfeiter, Frank Abagnale. As a teenager, Abagnale began a crime spree that would result in him cashing over $2.5 million in fraudulent checks and take on the false identities of a pilot, pediatrician, lawyer and college professor. In the film, Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins his crime spree after his parent's divorce. When he is faced with deciding which parent will retain custody he decides to run away. Throughout the film, Abagnale uses various identities including that of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer to facilitate his check cashing schemes. It's clear that Abagnale hopes that with enough money he can somehow reunite his separated parents. Throughout the narrative, Abagnale is hounded by FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows a begrudging respect for the young con artist. The development of their relationship is very believable and adds a lot of depth to the overall narrative of the story. Leonardo DiCaprio masterfully takes on the challenging role of Abagnale simultaneously illustrating to the audience Abagnale's genius (albeit misguided) and his naivety regarding his family. Christopher Walken provides great acting as Abagnale's father while Tom Hanks provides his usual great acting acumen portraying an FBI agent who becomes a father figure to the troubled Frank Abagnale. If there is one aspect of where the film fails is its failure to truly analyze the real Frank Abagnale's motives. The motivations of Abagnale are romanticized throughout the film as a young boy who naively believe he can bring his parents back together. The real Abagnale wasn't so innocent and was far more motivated by women and using his ill-gotten wealth to meet beautiful young women all over the world. This weakness is rather small and takes away none of the entertainment value that the film has to offer. This film is incredibly well acted and is a rare true crime film that deviates from the expected blood and gore of the drama usual of the genre.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Scorcese is obviously not the only one Dicaprio can hit a home run for!,43656,thekyles99,27 October 2010,"Finally sat down and watched this film starring the always awesome Leonardo Dicaprio.

Abagnale (Leonardo Dicaprio) a con man who as a young boy worshipped the ground his father (Christopher Walken) walked on .His dad teaches him some lessons at a young age on how to get things for free unfortunately not knowing how far his son would run with this info. Frank's world is shattered when his parents divorce causing him to runaway and start is life of deceiving companies and people for their money, major ally from a prestigious airline. Frank learns the art of deception in the form of creating fraudulent company cheques getting it down to a science and distributing them all over various point of the globe. During his tenure he imposed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer all the time switching identities every time the feds especially one FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gets too close for comfort. Enjoy the cat and mouse game as Hanratty chases Abagnale all over the world.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Worth catching,43656,Stampsfightclub,23 March 2010,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Di Caprio) makes his way across America posing as a lawyer, a pilot, a doctor whilst all the while being chased by Carl Hanratty (Hanks) Based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale Jr. this ambitious crime caper is a turn for excitement harmless joy that encodes spurts of comedy in a dramatic construction of a man looking for a sense of mayhem and wealth, to live in his father's footsteps.

Flowing with the energy you would expect from a Spielberg project alongside Oscar nominated scorer John Williams you would expect a ferocious appetite of crime shindigs and sharp tantalising scenarios across America and for the most part we see a relaxing and remarkable story that is hard and equally remarkable to believe really happened.

Leo Di Caprio, in his first paring with Spielberg, stars as central character Frank, giving the conman an elusive personality whilst aiming to be naïve of the difficulties at home between his parents. Encoding uses of his father's charm and wit may seem corny but the resemblance between Di Caprio and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken is mirror like, giving the film a formidable consistency.

Tom Hanks, in more of a supporting role, has his moments as the stubborn and driven FBI agent determined to catch Frank. Hanks uses the character's intelligence to his advantage to make his acts seem fruitless whilst all the while maintaining a key objective. Hanks even slides in some delicious deadpan expressions, the knock knock joke in the car for one arguably one of Hanks best ever comedy moments, which is quite something given the American's CV.

The plot is the main drawback of the film's potential. Whilst the story itself is based on true events, there feels a lack of consistent believability, which is purely down to the messy structure placed upon it. Starting on a game show, it jumps back to Frank's youth, then to prison then forward to school years, then his fleeing, then forward to present and so forth and because of these Kangaroo style jumps there feels a reluctance to let us into the moment of the character and situation. We are just getting used to Frank being a pilot when the film shunts us to present day dealings and it is a real pain as if this film was portrayed in chronological order we would have had a flawless foundation for an endless chase without knowing the outcome.

Williams' score is brilliant, especially the title sequence and Oscar nominated was a truly deserved. The title sequence matches the feel of the music so poignantly we are instantly engaged and ready for the off.

The film collaborates usage of career mastery and unanswered questions to the eventual finale, that is worth catching and as mentioned, had this film gone from past to present with no flash back/forwards it would have been perfect. As it is, this is a charming often funny crime drama that is an enjoyable ride of a true story.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Pretty Interesting Look At An Impersonator,43656,ccthemovieman-1,25 April 2006,"This is kind of an odd story, another one of those based-on-a-true life tales. This was hyped up a little too much for me because I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending. The only thing I didn't enjoy watching was DiCaprio (as ""Frank Abagnale"") taking advantage of genuinely-nice girls. This guy was no hero, believe me.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A Dishonest Movie,43626,Theo Robertson,17 January 2006,"!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!

Much hyped as a true story on its release CATCH ME IF YOU CAN tells the tale of con artist extrodanaire Frank Abagnale Jr and FBI agent Carl Hanratty's attempt to catch him but the cold facts are this is not a true story - It's a Hollywood story inspired by real events and therefore the audience are required to do nothing more than pay their money at the box office , sit back and be entertained . Certainly they won't be expected to ask questions such as why is con man Abagnale being portrayed as some sort of misunderstood little boy lost

Right from the outset we're shown Abagnale's ability to con people as being a force of good . Check out the scene in the school where he takes the class bully down a peg or two "" Ah "" thinks the audience "" Frank's a good guy , he's a man of morality "" but I'm afraid he's not because he's a con artist and the story telling technique doesn't allow much thinking to be done by the audience . What about the scenes where he passes himself off as an airline pilot . Can anyone explain to me how he did this for many months and was never ever suspected of being a fraud ? Didn't anyone ever ask him seriously technical questions about flying a jet that caused alarm bells to be rung ? These questions are never answered

Abagnale also passed himself as a doctor where he falls in love with a young nurse lacking confidence called Brenda and this sub section of the story caused a few alarm bells to be rung in my head , so after I saw the movie I conducted some internet investigation only to find that while Abagnale was posing as a doctor a baby almost died under his care due to his own lack of medical knowledge . I ask you if the screenplay included this scene how would you feel about Abagnale then ? Exactly . All through the running time we're shown Frank Abagnale as some kind of cheeky chappie , a little bit naughty but hey he's a young good looking kid with no real harm in him . As John Ford said - "" Always print the legend ""

I can certainly understand why people enjoyed CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and won't criticise them for it and I can also understand why Spielberg and company decided to make an entertaining movie that doesn't dare get involved in any type of morality . It is unfortunate however that the director and everyone else involved are involved in fundamental dishonesty themselves",neg

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Fascinating, joyful and thoughtful.",43748,zaytsevaanya,18 February 2019,"Inspired by the true story of Frank William Abagnale junior the movie follows Frank's runaways of being a con man successfully posing as an airplane pilot, a doctor and an attorney Frank by escaping from FBI for years.

Here we see the story of a schoolboy, a minor American teenager who managed to work in different spheres while being so young. The movie itself is light and fascinating with a good humour as well. However, the story also touches some deep social issues by showing a guy who has experienced the divorce of his parents, the adulating period and the significant time when he was completely lonely. Being influenced by parental problems, he decides to escape a life he no longer loves as well as to escape from himself. Therefor, the film gives us the opportunity to wonder about who we are in the face of where we have come from.

Dreaming about a united family, Frank works to get his mother and father back together and make the family whole again. Of course, this can't work. During the movie he meets with father a several times and tries to convince him to get his mother back but a teenager doesn't understand that everything is broken and he needs to face the cruel world by himself. The moment, when Frank sits with Brenda's family and watching them being happy he wants so badly to have the same reunion and be frankly loved by his own family. While I was watching the movie, I clearly saw that Frank tries to resemble his father. Moreover, he learns from his father how to be the ""second mouse"" and get off with whole skin, whereas the moment with a necklace demonstrates it clearly.

I also was astonished by this movie as the director shot so many peculiar and unique details which helped us to understand the personality of Abagnale. For instance, the scene when Frank comes to cash his checks and witnesses the name tags whether the woman is Miss or Mrs. for the purpose of flirting or not. Or another moment, when at the beginning of the movie the comics with Flash hero are shown just next to the Frank's bed and after that the allusion to this hero appears during the whole movie.

So , I highly recommend to watch this movie as you will surely enjoy the great work of Spielberg and the perfect acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Great fun based on a real story,43748,perica-43151,7 January 2019,"This is one intriguing movie about a very fascinating real life sociopath, that, fittingly, works for the feds nowadays. Movie is fast paced, grips your attention from start to finish, Leonardo Di Caprio almost redeems himself for Titanic, in any case he is brilliant here. The Spielberg shows his talents too. There is also a beautiful opening credits animation as an icing on the cinematic cake.

CatchMeIfYouCan,There wasn't much that I found wrong or exceptionally great about this film.,43656,theVade,11 July 2017,"There wasn't much that I found wrong or exceptionally great about this film. It had some great comedic moments, and I felt that it was an entertaining flick all the way till the end. How much of it is true is beyond my knowledge, but for a man to get away with so much.. it's kinda crazy. I will say that other than the great characters and their development, this did not feel like a Spielberg film. It just didn't have that masterful touch that I usually get from his other films. Is that bad? Well, no. It just doesn't feel like his best movie. So in conclusion I gave Catch Me If You Can a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10. Although I wanted to give it an ""Alright"" this film's characters and actors were outstanding and really made this film a good movie. The small issues with how the story was told, and Jennifer Garner's character (kidding) really held this film down from being a truly memorable one. If this film showed each event in chronological order this movie would have had great suspense and would have be a great movie overall, yet all it really gives us was Jennifer Gardner, and no one really wants that.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A film well worth catching,43718,TheLittleSongbird,31 January 2017,"Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.

While 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.

Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.

John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.

This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.

It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.

Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Clever and charming!,43718,tdinh,2 December 2013,"If you're looking for a movie that's lighthearted at times, sad during others, and charming overall, this definitely meets those requirements. I was laughing throughout most of it, but there were certainly some very poignant scenes in which the strong emotions felt by Frank, Jr. (played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio) were illustrated perfectly.

I thought one of the things that Steven Spielberg does a good job of with this film is providing the audience with a psychological understanding of why Frank does what he does. Spielberg gives us Frank's past and background through the use of flashbacks throughout the movie, and this really helps the audience sympathize with the young con artist to the point where you're almost rooting for him albeit his illegal criminal activity. Another thing Spielberg also does well is the emphasis he puts on how much effort and time the clever Carl Hanratty (played by the incredible Tom Hanks) puts into capturing Frank, and by showing how similar they really are despite the cat and mouse game they play.

Overall, the film is great. The acting is superb, but with an A-list cast such as DiCaprio (whose baby face fits the role of young Frank, Jr. perfectly by the way), Hanks (who gave excitement and life to a potentially bland character), and Christopher Walken (Frank, Sr.) with a quick appearance by the always wonderful Jennifer Garner, this is to be expected. The charm that DiCaprio brings to his character is fun to watch as well. I gave it 9/10 because I do think it runs a bit long, and the flashbacks sort of take away a bit of the suspense, but the film is exciting and certainly makes up for it in other areas.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A movie worth catching and watching,43656,Maziun,8 November 2013,"This movie is based on real story . Since this is a Hollywood movie probably some things were changed , but that doesn't really matter . What is important is this movie entertains . It's long , 2 hours and few minutes , yet it's never boring . It's set during the 60's and 70's and the humor in ""Catch me if you can"" reminds me humor from movies from that time. My favorite joke is the ""knock, knock"" joke from Hanks.

The opening credits sequence is brilliant. It's one of the best opening sequences ever. DiCaprio fits in his role well with his boyish look .Tom Hanks is nice as the grumpy FBI agent. Christopher Walken steals the show with his performance as the charming , always optimistic father of our hero. He deserved Oscar nomination. It was also good to see Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. Jennifer Garner appearance was rather pointless.

The tricks that DiCaprio uses look believable . I can only complain that he acts a little bit stupid during the second half of the movie , but maybe that's how it was in the real life ? Anyway the movie provides good fun . There is some depth here . Both DiCaprio and Hanks are lonely people who have nothing more than their jobs . Spielberg also tries to explain why Frank Abagnale Jr. started his criminal career . His explanation sounds logical – he was running away because he couldn't deal with his parents marriage problems (He was 16 years old then).

""Catch me if you can"" is a well made fluff entertainment. I give it 8/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A welcome departure from Spielberg's usual style,43687,cartman_1337,9 September 2013,"This is the story of perhaps the biggest American fraudster in history, and the cat-and-mouse chase to catch him. A hunt that in many ways brought Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) together, since in many ways they were each other's lives at the time, and culminated in a lifelong friendship. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s story is an incredible one. By the time he turned 18, he had successfully played the roles of an airline captain, a doctor and a lawyer, and cashed in false checks for over $2.5 million. This is the film of his story, based on Frank's own accounts of the events. And it is an exceptionally entertaining film. Cocky con artists succeeding pretty much always make for a fun film, and when it's based on the true events of a young and likable man, it gets even more fun. It's amazing what you can get away with a little ingenuity and enormous amounts of nerve. But there's of course a price to pay when your whole life revolves around living a lie.

Catch Me If You Can is actually a rather unusual film to bear Spielberg's name. The usual Spielberg trademarks are mostly absent from this film, without that necessarily being a bad thing. Initially Spielberg didn't intend to direct this film at all; it was Gore Verbinsky who first got the job. But when Leonardi DiCaprio was called back to film more scenes for Gangs of New York, delaying the shoot, Verbinsky had to withdraw. At that time James Gandolfini was lined up for the role of Carl Hanratty. It could've been interesting to see how the film had turned out with them, but looking at the film as it is, it is hard to imagine it being better than the Spielberg/Hanks collaboration it turned out to be, their fifth at the time.

Along with Spielberg's departure from his usual style, there's also John William's soundtrack, which is very different from the pompous soundtracks he's most known for. It's jazzy and beautiful, and fits the 60s setting perfectly. The acting is first rate, from the leads of Leonardo DiCaprio, who started showing at the time that there was more to him than just being a heartthrob, and Tom Hanks, both delivering top notch work, to brilliant supporting parts from actors like Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. It's a well crafted and playful movie overall, delivering the goods across all lines. It's a highly entertaining movie, that I'm sure will stand the test of time. Recommended!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Amusing and entertaining,43656,a-ozornin,12 April 2012,"When we were children, we used to imagine who we want to become: astronauts, firefighters, top-models, whoever. Apparently some people live their lives as if they are still playing in the courtyard; they easily change their occupations, looks, even characters. Catch Me If You Can is about such a man.

This is a true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor. He admires his father and from him he learns how to manipulate people and systems. Of course, he attracted attention of the police forces, and in particular of Carl Hanratty, man in charge of falsifications in the US. The pursuit that ensues is the main focus of the movie.

The plot is based on the autobiographical book by Frank Abagnale Jr. himself, where he describes his adventures, and despite the huge potential that the book had to offer to the movie makers in terms of the characters, relationships etc, the movie turned out to be nice extra rather than the stand alone piece of art.

The movie lacks personality. Charisma of real Frank Abagnale Jr. did not allow Steven Spielberg to put anything personal in the movie. It is simply re-telling of the book; the director or the screenplay writers don't have their own opinions on the matters going on, they simply take the back seat and show us what happened to the main character. This approach made the movie automatically inferior to the book – the audience still needs guidance; good movie is always a dialogue, not a monologue, not a dry ascertaining of facts. It is still amusing and interesting to watch, but poor Frank and Carl look like animals in the zoo rather than humans with human feelings and emotions. It starts to feel artificial game of cat and mouse.

The famous director failed to inhale life in the characters. Little surprise that the star cast didn't manage to do it either. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks clearly do their best. DiCaprio convincingly plays immature kid with little understanding of consequences of his actions. Hanks convincingly plays workaholic cop. But the lack of conflict, lack of deep interactions means that the characters don't evolve, and in the end of the movie we see the same two chaps that we saw in the beginning. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams – they all play their parts perfectly, creating exactly the characters they were asked to create. Shame they still look unnatural. And in the end, all the action around the master of reincarnations simply leads to the thought that maybe exciting, fulfilling life doesn't need to be full of action and pursuits and God-knows-what. Maybe what people actually need to live truly interesting lives is the presence of other people, who would guide, teach and just talk meaningful talks. Who needs all the checks and all the millions if there is nobody around to tell you where to spend it?

The story of the man who never stopped being a small child is worth watching only for the sake of this idea.

VERDICT: Good illustration to the book, amusing and interesting, even though it fails as the movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Spielberg, Hanks, DiCaprio: Catch this film if you can",43656,gregeichelberger,11 February 2012,"Review first published on Dec. 27, 2002.

The one thing we do not see enough in movies today is a good animated opening credit sequence. That's why when ""Catch Me If You can"" began with such a treat, I immediately knew this was going to be an exceptional motion picture.

And my prediction was correct.

Starting off with the clever cartoon opening and the quick, jazzy score by John Williams, the perceptive observer recalls films such as ""The Pink Panther,"" ""Around the World In 80 Days"" and ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

We are then swept into the world of Frank Abangale, Jr., taken from his book and adapted for the screen by Jeff Nathanson. In a nice opening scene, Frank, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man — who because of various situations in life — impersonated a teacher, an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a Secret Service agent (and almost gets away with it), is introduced on an episode of TV's ""To Tell the Truth."" In addition to fooling hundreds of people over the years, he cashed over $4 million in fraudulent checks. During most of his escapades, Frank is hunted by an obsessive FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (a wonderful performance by Tom Hanks).

In almost a Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner fashion, the impersonator pulls off several miraculous escapes, leaving the law with a fresh coat of egg on its face. While DiCaprio's Abangale is clever, free-spirited, charming, sexy and charismatic, Hanratty is a lonely divorced father, dull, sour and doggedly determined to catch his thief.

Both manage to communicate with each other over the course of several Christmas Eves because they know each others' minds. Both are also pathetic characters in their own way, although poles apart, personality-wise.

While Frank's choice as a pilot (he only flies free as a ""dead-head,"" never actually attempting to control an aircraft), is to attract women, he is forced into the medical and legal professions directly because of Carl's detective work.

Hank's character — complete with a perfect Boston accent — can get close to his prey, but can never quite bring him in. Meanwhile, as a doctor, Frank (who watched episodes of ""Dr. Kildare"" to bone up on his surgical technique) attracts a naive young nurse in braces (Amy Adams) whose father (played by Martin Sheen), is a District Attorney in New Orleans.

Studying for two weeks — and watching ""Perry Mason"" — he passes the Louisiana bar exam on his first try and becomes Sheen's assistant. Playing it super cool, as well as picking up professional jargon and vernacular, Frank bluff his way through several hilarious situation, including making $400 from a prostitute who thought SHE was ripping HIM off.

Later, though, things become very dark, indeed, as Frank's constant dodging the law is less and less fun. During the masquerades, his mother (Natalie Baye) divorces his father (Christopher Walken, an Oscar winner for ""The Deer Hunter"" and who will probably get a nomination for this role, as well) after an affair with a lodge buddy (James Brolin).

Frank's father, hounded himself (by the IRS), sees through his son's fraud, and while secretly envying him, knows it can only lead to misfortune. Finally captured, Frank is given an entire new career in a nice twist of an ending.

""Catch Me If You Can"" is a major departure for director Steven Spielberg, whose last several films — ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""A.I."" — have been of the utmost seriousness. This almost lighter-than-air picture still manages to tug a few heartstrings here and there, but maintains its cheerful look or the most part.

Sometimes, a bit too long (at two hours, 20 minutes), audiences will nevertheless find the humor and breeziness of this movie too irresistible to let this bother them.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,excellent,43687,rebeccac-282-499646,3 February 2012,"I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.

It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.

All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Hanks vs Dicaprio: The Mad Men Years...,43687,loogenhausen,9 November 2011,"Spielberg did it again with this one. After the entertaining but overrated Minority Report, he brought us one of his most effortlessly fun films in a long time. I caught myself grinning from ear to ear many times throughout the movie. DiCaprio turns in his finest performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape & The Basketball Diaries. Even though the story is based on a true story/autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr., it all seems like some crazy Hollywood plot that's just too irresistible not to love. As for the rest of the cast, Tom Hanks is (as always) thoroughly reliable as the G-man set on catching Abagnale. Christopher Walken steals every scene he exists in as dad Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank Jr.'s impetus and inspiration for his outlandish check fraud spree. Like father, like son indeed. Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner make delightful appearances in key scenes and John Williams' score is top notch, perfectly catching the snappy-cool kitsch of the 60's in every note. It's all a refreshing mix of everything we've come to fall in love with the movies. Some may be taken aback by the lackadaisical pacing, expecting some action set piece to pop up - and thank Odin there weren't any to be found",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,handsome biography!,43687,bonzybino,13 October 2011,"Biographic movies are always populace, this one in particular would be my personal favorite of all. The ensemble cast in a Spielberg movie which happens to be a biography would be nothing less than good, true to keeping the name high, Catch me If u can is a terrific watch for those who love biographies and for those who enjoy quality movies.

Leonardo Caprio And Tom hanks teaming up with Spielberg was more than enough for me to watch it way back like a decade ago. And never feel tired watching it even today, for its all handsomely shown, those life pictures of a con man from real life. Frank Abagnale JR would be your real life hero instantly, cant think of another person portraying Frank than Caprio, hes just handsome and his behavioral acting would have helped a lot in it. The music was tricky with a mystical feel adding tempo to the chase and tricky parts in the movie.

When a hearty biography is directed by Steven Spielberg cant complain about a flaw anywhere, but to be fair, it wasn't that engrossing as a Schindlers List - i know its stupid to even compare- and would be able to give only a 8 though i thoroughly enjoyed it",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,An absolute blast,43687,KnightsofNi11,6 August 2011,"I love sitting down to watch a movie, not expecting much, and then being pleasantly surprised by what a great movie it was. That is just the case with Stephen Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the most successful and intelligent con men of all time. When Frank is sixteen his father runs into problems with the IRA and loses his entire fortune, which also prompts his wife to leave him. From then on Frank vows to earn back his father's savings. He does so through a slightly (i.e. extremely) illegal manner. Check fraud. Frank travels the world taking on different personas, faking work as a pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc. But once the money he is illegally earning starts to build up, red flags go up for the FBI and Agent Carl Hanratty, played so well by Tom Hanks, sets out on an obsessive quest to chase down and capture Frank.The film is clever, quick, and an absolute blast.

The nice thing about Catch Me If You Can is that it doesn't take itself too terribly seriously. It is more of a lighthearted film with a serious undertone. This film is actually really funny at times before it grows into a more serious story of character development and winding plot progression. But from start to finish it manages to retain a feeling of witty intelligence that stays smart and intelligible, but also entertaining and fun. The film never gets unbearably boring, even when it slows down for more serious plot points. It is 140 minutes long so certain things are a bit drawn out and I can't say that every scene has a major purpose, but it's always fun and always entertaining.

I have a certain asphyxiation with con and heist films, so Catch Me If You Can is sort of a dream come true for me. It is every single thing about great and clever cons wrapped into one film. Watching Frank Abagnale work is like magic. The situations he talks his way out of and the ways he manages to get around certain things is uncanny. The film is based on a true story so I'm not sure what about his cons is true and what is exaggerated, but it all makes for great entertainment. There's something so inherently fascinating about the way he manipulates people through ingeniously subtle psychology and the way it works seamlessly, most of the time at least.

The film also succeeds by adding a new layer to a typical con film. It makes its incredibly clever and devious protagonist human. A lot of films portray the con man as a flawless machine that works everything out so perfectly and executes every minute detail without a single issue, so much so that they are more of a gimmick than an actual character. The character of Frank Abagnale is truly human, complete with all of his inner turmoil and realistic flaws. Throughout the film he grows more and more troubled as the law gets closer and closer to him. We see a very human transformation that is as touching as it is fascinating. By the end of the film we love this character not because he is a clever genius, but because he is human.

If I had any tiffs with the film they would be that it runs a little long and some of the logic doesn't always add up. But it's nothing to make me dislike this film in any way. It was a blast to watch and a joy to reflect on. Strong performances helm the film while a great atmosphere and wonderfully intelligent character development make its roots run deeply sincere. This film is one of the most human con man stories I have ever seen and for that it deserves a hefty amount of credit. This is a fantastic film.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.,43687,Spikeopath,2 July 2010,"When his parents announce they are going to divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) runs away from home and embarks on a career as a conman. Originally only armed with some blank cheques, Frank cons his way into being airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and into a couple of million dollars. But hot on his trail is dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).

Frank Abagnale Jr. a real guy, who did these real things. Sure there's some liberties taken with the adaptation from Abagnale Jr's own book, but regardless it's a fascinating story that transfers very well to the screen. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is perhaps a touch overlong as he slots in an on going father/son relationship that didn't happen, a classic broken home theme close to his heart of course. But this is no popcorn fodder piece. It's a black comedy that's tender at times but also also rather moving, even as the humour starts to kick in, we get plenty of reminders that Frank is running not just from the law, but also his unhappy past. There's no shirking from some of the darker aspects in the tale too. Infidelity, abortion and parental pressure all show their faces, never mind the troubling point of airline security eh!.

Clocking in as it does at over two hours, the plot and its little thematics required the highest calibre of acting talent to keep the audience interested. Here's Spielberg's trump card. A fine ensemble gather and reward the bearded one with some of their best work. Certainly DiCaprio hasn't been this good since Titanic, while Hanks continues to live up to the Jimmy Stewart of his generation tag with another, yet different, everyman performance. As for Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Senior, well, get the hankies ready for you will have to have been cut from granite to not let Walken pull your emotional strings. Good support comes from Martin Sheen & Amy Adams, while Jennifer Garner pops in for a sultry and sensual little cameo.

A great story is given exceptional treatment by some of Hollywood's biggest hitters. Score! 8/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Run, Run as Fast as You Can",43687,baldwi17,23 April 2010,"Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is running from a crumbling family life. Frank sets out reconnect his mother (Nathalie Baye) and father (Christopher Walken). Frank Jr.'s mother leaves his father because of some financial difficulties. Quickly Frank finds out that the real world doesn't come cheap and pays for his new lifestyle with fraudulent checks. Only being 16, Frank finds out that all the money in the world cannot bring back the past. Pushed by his father, Frank desperately tries to buy his parents reunion. A great true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., Catch Me If You Can shows the lengths a young man will go to in order to get back what he holds dear.

Hot on Frank's heals is the smart, but often mistaken, FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). While trying to reconnect his parent's lost marriage, Frank finds something he isn't looking for in Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). The two hit it off and quickly fall in love. A reoccurring color and lighting motif appears in the meeting of Frank and Brenda and suggests the possible downfall of Frank's new life. (It's always a girl.) Director Steven Spielberg manipulates lighting and color to show the glamorous lifestyle of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer, all careers Frank cons his way into. The contrast to the brightness of the glamorous appears in a drab, dark palette when young Frank's life isn't heading where he would like.

Like Max in Where the Wild Things Are, Frank creates a new world for himself in order to deal with what is taking place at home. DiCaprio does a phenomenal job of creating empathy from the audience for his character. Although Frank is breaking the law, it is hard not to root for him.

Frank manipulates people to get to his goal, an elaboration of something he learned early on from his father. Little did he know at the time, Frank's lifestyle gave him the education to now be the world's foremost leading authority on check fraud.

Frank sets out to re-establish his childhood, but ends up growing into a lifestyle all his own.",pos

Leonardo DiCaprio did really good and so did Tom Hanks. This movie turned out to be a dramadey including such scenes like how when Frank became a pilot for Pan Am, he seduced an older woman! That man is a player. It turned out to be Ellem Pompeo, who I think is hot. This movie told the story of how he became a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer. Not very many people can do that.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Great fun, DiCaprio is perfect",43718,Snoopymichele,7 March 2007,"SPOILERS BELOW

This is one of those movies that you're not sure you are going to like, and you watch it, and you end up loving it. It's fast paced, well acted and directed, and great fun.

Leonardo DiCaprio is utterly charming and endearing as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who in the 1960's posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer-all the while evading the FBI who wanted him for check fraud. Tom Hanks shines as Carl Hanratty, the fed who first wants to nail Frank, then ends up taking him under his wing and giving him new direction in his life. Christoper Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank's star-crossed parents also give fine performances. Amy Adams nearly steals the movie as the young woman who steals Frank's heart.

The film is about a young man who is traumatized by what the US government has done to his family so he decides to literally become other people to escape from whom he really is. Frank is a charming smooth talker with an uncanny knack for forging checks and documents. He's so angelic looking and unassuming that none of his victims are aware they are being conned. As he has proved time and again in films like ""This Boy's Life,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and ""Titanic,"" DiCaprio is more than just a pretty face. He has the talent to back it up, and this role is tailor-made for him. Under Spielberg's direction, he's taken that talent to another level. Ultimately it becomes about a surrogate father/son relationship between Frank and Carl. While he's trying to outwit and outrun the sometimes curmudgeonly FBI agent, Frank admires him at the same time. Carl, for his part, does hold a soft spot for Frank, and he leads him down the path to redemption.

The sets, the costumes, and the music all capture the essence of the sixties, when anything was possible and nothing was out of reach if you wanted it.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this film-I give it a 9 out of 10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,This movie is a keeper....,43718,efifis@hotmail.com,17 February 2006,"Catch me if you can is the story of a true fake, and is cleverly told through the fine acting performance by Leonardo Dicaprio. There is a great supporting cast too especially Frank Abagnale Senior played by Christopher Walken who is hilarious when he lies, and who's character along with Dicaprio's I generally sympathized for despite always trying to scam the authorities. I thought the chemistry between Leonardo's character (Frank Abagnale Jr) and Carl Handraty played by Tom Hanks was great to watch. The story is a bit hard to believe but if anyone can get away with passing as a Lawyer, Doctor, Secret Service Agent and Pilot its Leonardo, and if anyone can make a knock knock joke funny its Tom hanks. This movie is a keeper.... 9/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,Getting Away With Murder,43656,raulfaust,1 May 2014,"Well, first I'd like to comment how easy it is to lure spectator into this movie, due to the great names involved in this project. Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken are what made me wanna see it. To be honest, the film as a whole is good. Frank Jr. is a guy who is willing to do anything in his power to make easy money, even if it means stealing and cheating all around. There are plenty of moments in which the spectator gets to think ""he won't get away with it"", but, surprisingly, the well written plot always allows him escaping from the FBI. However, sometimes the way DiCaprio's character gets away feels over-the-top, considering that people wouldn't be THAT dumb in real life. I mean, how would Frank Jr. work as a physician in a hospital without EVER being asked about diseases or something related to it? Wouldn't Brenda's family make questions involving medicine? So, in my opinion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a well directed movie that entertains the spectator for the whole time, but sometimes admits to be just a movie and not a real thing.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,An entertaining film,43656,kdammers,28 December 2005,"This movie is about the making and doings of an incredible con-man. The movie should NOT be seen as a biography of the real con-man (assuming that his co-authored autobiography is for real), since the interesting psychological background is made up and some of the incidents are fictitious. The movie uses a couple of framing devices to get started: the hunter goes to a French jail to get the hunted and take him back to the United States; the hunted is introduced on ""What's My Line"" ( a popular mid-century U.S. t.v. show). Then there is a flash-back to the hunted's childhood, and we watch his development into a con-man.

The pacing and characterizations are well done, and the viewer is kept pleasantly off-balance by both situations and switching empathy for the hunter and the hunted.

The period items (like the ""What's My Line"" bit, clothing, cars, ways of talking) do more than just ring true: they draw viewers back into that time and place.

Although the film is primarily entertainment, the story it tells gives one pause more than once. What does it mean that a teen-ager could pass himself off as a professional in various fields? Was he really driven to do what he did, or was he simply a rogue? (This latter question might be answered differently depending on whether one is discussing the movie or the book).",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,A twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare.,43687,cruise-imdb,17 March 2006,"Catch Me If You Can is the screen adaptation of the autobiography of Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), renowned as one of America's youngest and most successful con men. The story tells how Frank Jr. steals over four million dollars by forging checks while impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, all before his nineteenth birthday. The film also stars Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI special agent assigned to track down Frank Jr. By telling this cat-and-mouse story from both the perspective of the cat and the mouse, director Steven Spielberg shows that hard work and honesty are more rewarding in the long run than any get rich quick scheme.

The theme of Catch Me If You Can is best illustrated in scenes involving Frank Abagnale Jr. and Frank Sr., played by Christopher Walken (nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor). In one scene Frank Jr. treats his father to dinner in a fancy restaurant, where he tries to make a gift to his father of a brand new Cadillac. Although Frank Jr. has been forging checks and only posing as an airline pilot, he lies to his father and tells him that he has become a co-pilot for Pan-American airlines. By lying to his father, Frank Jr. shows that he understands the values his father has tried to teach him, even if his actions don't reflect those same values. Although he has stolen everything he has, Frank Jr. knows that he can only gain his father's approval by posing as someone who is hard working and respectable.

In a later scene Frank Jr. meets with his father to announce that he's getting married. When Frank Sr. reveals that he knows that his son is wanted by the FBI, Frank Jr. begs his father to make him stop. Frank Jr. storms out of the bar when his father encourages him to continue running from the law. Frank Jr.'s reaction shows that he regrets his choice of a life of crime and wants to stop running.

By showing Frank Jr. as regretful and ready to stop committing crimes, the audience is allowed to develop some small amount of sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic character. This ploy has been used by writers of the heist and con-man genres for years, for example 2001's The Score, and 2003's Matchstick Men.

Spielberg uses many film elements to illustrate the theme in Catch Me If You Can. For example, When Frank Sr. is accepting an award honoring his hard work, he is filmed from a low angle. In contrast Frank Jr. is filmed from a high angle in the same scene. The combined effect of these two angles is to place Frank Sr. on a pedestal in his son's eyes.

Catch Me If You Can is a twentieth century retelling of Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a smooth-talking con man who stays several steps ahead of the plodding FBI agent who pursues him. But by the end of the film we see the tortoise's deliberate effort pay off as he finally catches up to the exhausted hare.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,The Sara Lee of films,43475,bregund,5 November 2003,"***This review contains spoilers***

The biggest problem I have with this film is the same one I had with Coppolla's `Dracula': this film is a hodgepodge of vignettes, less a continuous stream than a series of carefully crafted scenes. Normally the editing process of a film patches the scenes together into a unified whole, so that the resulting film flows, but in this film nearly every scene opens and closes like its own little film, leaving little room for character development. I have no idea what motivates Frank Abagnale, for example. One might be tempted to look at the failure of the family business or his parents' divorce as a catalyst, but still we are given absolutely no insight into the character. It would have been nice to see the characters given a little humanity instead of looking and acting like stiff background characters from some crappy 1960s cartoon.

In one of the most bald-faced product placements I've ever seen, three FBI agents, including Hanks, are invited in to Franks's mother's house for `Sara Lee'. One of the agents says: `nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.' That might be true if the only food you've ever eaten is tree bark, but the waxy, unsatisfying desserts offered by Sara Lee are the Keanu Reeves of the dessert world: they look good, but have no substance.

Situations arise and disappear like zephyrs. Why does Frank apply for the job at the hospital, did he get tired of being a pilot? He gets the job at the hospital, okay that's simultaneously interesting and funny, but then what happens? Does he quit, is he fired? How does the girl get back together with her parents, did they forgive her, does she keep her job? How did Frank perform as an attorney? When and how did he buy a house in Atlanta? Who are all those people at his house? What was the deal with model/prostitute? The whole scene served absolutely no purpose. There are dozens and dozens of unanswered questions such as these, from start to finish, leaving a curiously empty, unsatisfying feeling, much like eating a frozen dessert made with artificial chemicals. That Sara Lee gets such a high-profile product placement in this film is no coincidence, I am sure.

Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances as Frank's father. Like Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story, Walken's face tells more about the character than anything he could ever say. His performance is so rich and deep that he should be nominated for best supporting actor. LDC, having shown so much promise in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' is merely adequate in the role of Frank Abagnale; he's no Christopher Walken, that's for sure. Hanks plays himself, doing his best Robin Williams impression of Tom Hanks playing a dramatic role, occasionally raising his voice just like he's been doing since Bosom Buddies. Hanks is the Sara Lee of actors.

All in all, this is an interesting film, albeit a curiously empty one. The day after you watch it, you won't remember any of it.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Stay Awake If You Can,43506,SWhite,28 December 2002,"Perversely, this movie would actually have to be better for me to dislike it. As it is, it's just too boring to care about. Good cast and crew, likeable production values, no complaints there - but there's also no story, no believability, no suspense, no interest, no ANYTHING.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives a one note performance in which he looks cute (whoa - THERE'S an Oscar caliber stretch, huh?) but tells us nothing about the character. Tom Hanks apparently decided to give nothing to this performance except some extra time at an all-you-can eat buffet. He's a slightly chubby cop obsessed with catching Leo for no particular reason; he doesn't even dislike Leo, nor is anyone else in the FBI apparently even interested in catching this ""master criminal.""

But worst of all, Leo's character impersonates a doctor, a pilot, and a criminal attorney...and yet we don't see him get caught in a tight scrape even once. As this is a real life story, surely the real Frank Abagnale had many hilarious or suspensful ""near misses"" - so why have they all been cut from this film? Leonardo postures in costumes; Hanks follows at a walking pace (with virtually no police procedural techniques shown); no one particularly cares if Leo's character is ever caught or not. (Worse still, in the opening five minutes of the film, you ALREADY KNOW whether or not he got caught, and who (if anyone) caught him). Peg this one at ""zero"" on the old suspense meter.

This seemed like a not particularly well-done TV movie, done for not a particularly prestigious network. A definite disappointment for all involved (even John Williams' score is lame). I'd say to wait for this one to hit the 99¢ rental rack...and then ""Catch It If You Must.""",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,The Equal Screen Time Ruined This Film,43565,Christmas-Reviewer,17 October 2017,"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. TRUST ME THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE. NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 Christmas MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FARE

This was a film that suffers because of over length. I am not sure who signed on to the film first. Leo or Tom. One thing is certain Both parts were equal in the amount of screen time each charterer got. This made the film exceptionally long and slow.

In this film three-time Oscar winning director Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can follows Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. as he successfully passes himself off as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor - all before his 21st birthday!

So many events in this film were fabricated that if you know the true story you can't believe they added so much for dramatic effect that in reality wasn't needed!

This film could have cut 30 minutes down easily by combing scenes or even eliminating few.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Hype-powered (slight spoiler),43626,Oneiric,1 January 2003,"The performances are good. Christopher Walken is himself, and even when he's sympathetic, he's odd. The movie looks clean. But for a caper/con movie, it's very slow.

(Spoiler) Also, the movie suffers from the typical neat Spielberg coda where ""Poof! Now he's happily married and a millionaire!"" Kind of like Mike Milken, Ivan Boesky and (soon to be) Enron, Adelphia and WorldCom figures who bilk little people for millions, serve almost no time, and come out ready to restart with all their cronies. I'm all for redemption, but without the context of the interceding years, this amounts to glamorizing grand theft and fraud. I'm sure the facts are true, but they didn't belong in the movie. Unless the director is making an expensive lesson advising his (and my) children that crime can pay if you're just clever enough.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,In Speilberg's world...,43595,mercuryadonis,2 January 2004,"Welcome to Steven Speilberg's world, a parallel universe where nuance, subtlety and personal interpretation are non-existent. In this world FBI agents are stumbling lead-footed stooges, wearing identical MIB suits and porkpie hats, who enter a suspected check-forger's apartment with handguns drawn, shouting ""CLEAR!"" as they stumble about from room to room. In this world a love scene must be accompanied by items on a bedside room service cart being knocked off one-by-one. A conversation between two secret agents must be shot in silhouette against an ominous blue background. A police station should be as glossily lit as a top European fashion emporium. The precocious hero must be able to escape an airplane lavatory in mere seconds, without tools, by removing 4 tiny screws. The love interest must be blonde, the in-laws stern, the failed father edgy, brittle and possibly nuts (Christopher Walken will do). And most of all the hero's dubious achievements must be shown to have benefited society in the long term and any of his character flaws attributed to youth, naivety and bad upbringing. After all, this is a movie and we can't have a fundamentally flawed hero or a morally ambiguous ending. Even if the said ""hero"" bilked countless innocent people out 4 million dollars.

It would be nice if just once Spielberg could depict a story or a sequence of events as they might realistically occur rather than having to plaster everything with his trademark gloss and worn-out directorial flourishes. It would be nice if you could come out of one of his movies with an opinion rather than an answer.

CatchMeIfYouCan,The Captain Sinks The Ship,43475,robertpanek2001,10 January 2003,"I love a good ""con"" flick and when I read about the exploits of Frank Abagnale recently in the prerelease publicity for this movie I was psyched to see this flick. Hey, it even has Steven Spielberg directing with a huge budget!

The story as it was told in the publicity for the movie left me filled with anticipation because I could not understand how a teenager could do what Frank Abagnale is reported to have done, and after watching ""Catch Me If You Can"" I still don't know how he could have done what he is supposed to have done.

Obviously this is a big problem, and the problem exists because Spielberg does not understand how Abagnale could have done these otherworldly things.

Spielberg took the lazy way out; he decided that because the events are supposed to be ""true"" (hey the FBI says they are!) he as director was under no obligation to convince us.

Wrong!

If you want to see a great ""con"" flick see the film masterpiece known as ""The Sting"". That was not ""based on a true story"" and thus George Roy Hill understood that for the film to work he had to make us believe that Redford and Newman could pull off such a caper and he succeeded so well that under repeated viewings we have no doubt that these two could both devise such a plot, find the ""talent"" to do the job and lead them successfully to the end.

In ""Catch Me If You Can"" Tom Hanks playing the FBI agent who tracks Abagnale around the country and in Europe (though he apparently went to South America as well and Spielberg or not South America never seems to fit into the budget) asks Abagnale to the very end how he passed the Bar exam to be an attorney in Louisiana.

We never get a believable answer. After 2 hours and 22 minutes we don't know how a teenager could work as a doctor in a hospital (and in a supervisory capacity over other doctors no less!) or become a prosecutor (!) in Louisiana.

What you will get though is all the ""big budget Spielberg"" that you could expect along with all the other Spielbergisms that you are familiar with. That's the problem with ""Catch Me If You Can"", it's a story that needed the recently departed George Roy Hill, but instead was bought by the director of ""The Color Purple"".",neg

It is one of my favourtie movies ever.

People love watching movies that I call 'excites them'. To explain this, think of Harry Potter, you may wonder why it is so popular and it is becasue it excites people as they wish for that world to be true. People love to watch movies they wish they could live in or have charaters they wish to be like. Fact.

It is the same with the movie Wolf of Wall Street, people love it because in a way they wish they could live (minus the consequences) the way Jordan Belfort lives in that movie (but they may not want to admit it), the different life style excites people as it is different from their own.

CatchMeIfYouCan,One To Keep You Engaged,43687,eric262003,17 June 2013,".The inspiration of the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" must have lingered in director Steven Spielberg's mind for decades after knowing the amazing misadventures our protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. encountered throughout his very highly interesting life. Spielberg who as a youth in the 1960's used to get past security at Universal Studios just to sneak in and marvel at the art of filmmaking.

Leonardo Di Caprio as Frank Abagnale Jr. is seen in the midst interviewing a Pan American supervisor to get a full report on the careers of airplane pilots for the purpose of writing an article for his high school paper. What's really going on is he's seeking knowledge on the many activities Pan Am pilots as he tries to successfully do everything he could to mimic them. Along with his savvy ways of impressions and conjuring up bogus cheques, the FBI is left high and dry as Abagnale Jr. leaks out millions of dollars from the banks. His pilot uniform gives him the advantage to cash in cheques globally.

Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale Sr. who at one time was a thriving businessman from New Rochelle, New York and is now been reduced to eating very little but his pride. The Internal Revenue Services has been giving him hell which resulted in him owing them a bucket load of cash. The Abagnales must leave their posh mansion to a small low budgeted apartment. If that wasn't bad enough, Frank Sr.'s Franch wife for many years has added flames to the fumes by divorcing the poor hard-lucked individual and goes off to marry Frank Sr's attorney friend (James Brolin) and Frank Jr's world is taken upon him.

Frank Jr has often seen his father used shady techniques to get the upper hand of people, so he makes the attempt to follow his father's legacy and enhances a few tricks of his his very own. It's soon revealed that Frank Sr. was rather subtle in his manipulative tactics compared to Frank Jr. who seems like a prodigy in in white-collar criminal activity.

The real turning point of the movie that will keep viewers on the edge of your seat is the exciting battle of wits between the slick con-artist as he escapes going to jail while hard-nosed FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Ranks) is hot on his trail. and would love nothing more than to see this kid eat prison food. Carl is divorced, but he is truly devoted to his job and even tried to call him at his office on Christmas Eve. They develop a bit of fondness for one another as the film progresses as Carl is impressed with Frank Jr.'s methodical suave demeanor and the game of cat and mouse is proved effective because every chance the FBI catches on to him, he seems to full a fast one on them each time. Frank Jr. admires the devotion and never give up attitude that Carl possesses in his work ethic.

The film is based on the true escapades of Frank Jr. who unfortunately gets arrested in a very dramatized situation in France. However, the FBI later in the film admire the white-collar criminal's tactics to catch other potential criminal minds.

After Abagnale Jr. served his sentence,he no longer continued his craft and made a butt-load of cash as a security consulter in a corporate world. In a strange twist of irony, he owed millions all the while he ended up saving millions. I guess true stories do have happy endings.

Martin Sheen has a supporting role as the father whose daughter wants to marry Frank Jr. but does not seem fond of his daughter's request. The unpredictable kid with a plethora of numerous alter-egos meets her as he's seen as an E.R. medical intern and before you know it, he's now a young lawyer who passed the State Bar in Louisiana. And next we see him as an assistant junior attorney working in his future father-in0law's firm.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,I can't believe he actually got away with all of that,43656,david-sarkies,12 November 2011,"This is a movie based upon a true story of a young con man who, in the space of a few short years, made millions of dollars cashing dodgy checks and passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and many other things as well. The movie is pits a determined FBI agent against this slippery criminal in an exposition of how hard it actually is to catch fraudsters. It is a very amusing movie, especially the scene where he walks into the French class of his new school and passes himself off as the teacher for an entire week (and he is able to do this because his mother, being French, has already taught him the language).

I'm not a big fan of Spielburg Movies, meaning that whenever he releases one I generally feign acknowledgement and then go off an do something much more interesting. Indeed I find most of his movies are either boring feel good movies (ET, Close Encounters) or simply movies demonstrating how wonderful he thinks he is. However, this movie was actually quite a surprise. It was funny, absorbing, and the characters were quite intriguing.

I remember when Tom Hanks was a comedy actor, though I would never put him in the same class of actors such as Eddie Murphy or the like. Once again, a lot of his old movies tended to be very light hearted feel good movies. However, he changed his direction with Philidelphia to more challenging roles. I can't say that this movie is one of those roles, since his character is very much like a cardboard cut out. However, this could simply be because the character that it is based upon is like that. He is an FBI agent that is determined to get his man and since he actually has nothing else for him (his wife left him) this is all that he has to define who he is.

De Caprio has actually come quite a long way. He definitely is no Brad Pitt, but a number of movies that he has been in (Inception for a start) are starting to catch my attention. However I am still ingrained with the concept of the teenie bopper heart throb that I suspect he never intended to become (particularly since The Basketball Diaries was one of his first movies). In this movie he also plays a character who is alone, however his loneliness does not arise from his dogged determination to succeed, but rather because he is always on the run. He cannot stop, and Hanks will not stop chasing him. This is not surprising because he is a crook, and the FBI will not let crooks (or at least the poor ones) escape. He is caught in the end, but the end actually provides a further twist. Still, I thought the whole enemies talking to each other on Christmas day, when both were alone, did emphasise the loneliness of both characters.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A cat-and-mouse chase that doesn't know which direction to take ...,43656,ElMaruecan82,28 October 2011,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a fitting title because I really tried to catch the appeal of the film and I almost managed until a final act that confirmed me one thing: a good story doesn't necessarily make a good film, a pity because the movie had great potential but  only as a comedy.

This is the film's problem; it's so ashamed of its comedic tones that it uses the moodiest drama as a counterpart. You have two levels in the film, when it's funny, it raises the humor to the level of greatest comedies reminding of good old Billy Wilder or Frank Capra's classics, and I mean that for the two acts, but when it's dramatic, boys it's so depressing I wonder if it's still the same film I'm watching and if it didn't actually convince Scorsese to hire Di Caprio as his new protégé. If only for one thing, I blame the film for having introduced Leo's new serious side.

I'm aware that Frank Abagnale Jr.'s back-story carries many serious undertones, but come on; the guy is a con artist, and the premise is so entertaining, why should we care for the whole torment inhabiting his heart? Although I admit I love the whole father-and-son relationship and I thought Christopher Walken delivered a great performance, the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. was begging for more and more comedy. The material was shamefully wasted in Spielberg's attempt to make a serious character study out of this.

And if it remained true to the first comedic premise, who else could have done a better job as a 'straight man' than Tom Hanks as Hanratty? He was a constant enjoyment as long as he was fooled by Leo -their first encounter is one of the funniest movie moments of the 2000's- but when the cat-and-mouse situation turned to his advantage, and Frank ultimately decided to help the FBI and become a new Hanratty, I couldn't help but be disappointed. I was waiting for the punch line, but I know, I know  this is a true story.

Well, let's admit this is not any con artist, this one was real, but that would have provided twice the excitement, even as a drama. Franks impersonated an airline pilot, doctor, assistant attorney general and history professor, and some of these exploits were made before he was 21. Well, I'm sure if a poll survey was made after the film's viewing, the majority would agree that the 'pilot' part was the most covered, with the most details about his growing craftsmanship as a fraudulent checks' maker. But how did he live as a doctor? How did his life consist on when he was a secret agent? The different chapters of his lives were so unequally covered that all we had to do, is to trust Leo's talent and sex appeal: if he did it once, he can do it anytime. I'm sorry but when you spend so much time on very depressing parts, why do you apply shortcuts on the most exciting ones?

And are we supposed to believe that Frank's talent relies more on his sex appeal than a developing expertise? I'm certainly not a feminist, but the way women were depicted in the film was offensive and killed off all the charm of seduction. There is a part where the flight attendant welcomes the pilots with a sort of sexy wink in her eyes: if at that moment, you can't guess that Leo will bang her in the next scene, you haven't seen enough movies in your life. There are absolutely no redeeming female characters in this film, their whole purpose is to serve as a foil for Leo's charm, falling in the most obvious and degrading traps like compliments about their eyes, or a necklace. What was a cute running-gag became a blatant exploitation of women regardless of their differences: from the sensitive nurse to the over- glamorized hooker, not to mention the poor flight attendants applicants, all smiling around unknowing that it's only their sexy butts that are used as a cover.

The whole film works as a fantasy anyway and not just for the chicks. It's so stylized that it was impossible to get any hint of realism even in the scenes that rang true, script-wise. The movie had one of the most memorable and stylized opening credits, the whole setting was trying so much to look 60's to the tiniest details, the cars, the clothes, the girls fashions, everything was aesthetically great looking, but at the end it was just like too 'sanitized'. I had the feeling I was watching an idealization of the 60's rather than a true biopic, maybe Spielberg is more at ease with World War II when it comes to the realism of a setting, but ""Catch Me If You Can"" was a fantasy on that level.

This is why it should have kept the comedic tone, and spends more time on the other chapters of his life, yes, it wouldn't have fitted the title, which was about a cat-and-mouse chase, but let's face it, at the end, after two long hours, it was becoming too redundant. Once he's caught, another time, he escapes etc. etc. and any attempt to focus on the deep relationship between Hanratty and Leo was just bullshit, one was doing her job and the other wouldn't have cared less of becoming his friend, or working with the law. He was in a dead- end and had no choice. So at least the film, could have been an entertaining story of how you can fool the system with a nice creativity, but it chooses to be a biopic with cringe-worthy voyeuristic value.

A nice try, an excellent premise, but a movie that doesn't know which direction to take, and this is saying a lot, coming from a Spielberg film.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Leonardo is Superb,43748,Boyo-2,24 January 2003,"Fully realizing the acting opportunity he was given, Leonardo acts his tail off in this true story of a real crook. He's not as cold-blooded as, say, Angelica Huston in ""The Grifters"", but he's ruthless, unstoppable and sharp as a tack. In many ways, he was just ahead of his time. Today he'd be on talk shows bragging about his conquests and would seem right in time. Back then people were more decent and trusting and he was able to exploit that.

Steven gives the movie a lot of style. It all looks and feels correct to the period but you are not assaulted w/this.

Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner are terrific too. Even Tom Hanks doesn't come across as annoying and self-important as he usually does.

Leo baby, I missed you. Thanks for coming back to the big screen. 9/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,My Favorite Steven Spielberg Movie!,43748,cinephile-27690,8 July 2018,"I got this at a garage sale, and I am so glad that I did! While the beginning may seem slow at first, this incredible true story of a minor who frauds over millions of dollars while gaining 3 careers is sure to enthrall you.

I myself was enthralled with it my first time and spent MONTHS telling about it to nearly all who crossed my path. I saw it with a friend and he loved it too.

Recently, at tech school, I brought it to show my class and they ALL thought it was the bomb! A classmate even asked me the next day if he could borrow it to show it to one of HIS friends.

The disadvantage to showing it in class was that they kept yapping their lips: ""Oh, is this going to happen?' ""How did he escape that plane bathroom?"" blah blah blah-and they would know if THEY WATCHED THE DANG MOVIE AND SHUT THEIR TRAPS!

So shut yours and witness this modern masterpiece, and let it play out-and do not miss it! Catch this movie if you can! :)",pos

You will enjoy each and every aspect of that movie, you can watch it in whatever mood you are in, and still you will see the beauty in it. You may even watch it more than once and you will never get bored of it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Fun and entertaining!,43718,TheTopDawgCritic,11 July 2017,"I'm shocked this is a Steven Spielberg film. I had no idea he would direct something out of his crazy wheelhouse, but nevertheless, it was executed perfectly.

When you have an all star A-list cast such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, what you end up is a film that is a fun ride and very entertaining!

Leo DiCap's role was played perfectly and very convincing in every disguise.

Not a unique film by any means, but certainly this one played out quite well.

It's a 9/10 from me!

CatchMeIfYouCan,A fun ride the whole way through!,43718,ianh-75355,10 July 2017,"Leo created the perfect character for Mr. Abagnale and it was wonderful to see all the crazy things he pulled off. Most of the time when I was watching this movie and Leo executed some incredible action I couldn't help but smile and say ""No way!"" I'd highly recommend this movie to any looking to have a great time watching an excellent film from the marvelous Mr. Spielberg.

Christopher Walken did a superb job as the father, he's not the traditional mentor and it works extremely well in this movie.

Tom Hanks does a marvelous job portraying the agent trying to catch Abagnale and his mind games work perfectly through every scene. His darker sense of tone works against the light hearted Abagnale.

Leo is one of my favorite actors and this just amplified my belief in him. He is so charismatic in every role and this one is no different. Not much else to say, it's Leonardo DiCaprio!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Worth a watch but not a must-see,43656,blumdeluxe,4 December 2016,"One of the most important things a film should offer its audience is surely a story worth being told. ""Catch me if you can"" definitely achieves this. The story of a charming fraud, a young man that starts his career in crime out of desperation and boredom and achieves everything a regular man or woman can only dream of without really hurting anyone. The story of a most unlikely friendship between two men that play cat and mouse with each other for such a long period of time that they finally come to respect each other.

While the story thus has a lot to offer, there are also some points that prevent this movie to really become a classic in my eyes. The characters, apart of DiCaprio's one appear a bit flat and one-dimensional and not much effort was put into their development. Some exaggerations further lead the way into a movie that's definitely entertaining, more so than many other blockbusters, but that in the end doesn't really leave a huge impact as well.

Well worth a watch for an entertaining evening but not a must-see in my opinion.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,One Of The Best Biographical Films,43718,ionisz,6 July 2016,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is one of the Steven Spielberg's gorgeously crafted real life adaptations, along side with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". The only major difference between ""Catch Me If You Can"" and the other two is that this is obviously the only one with humorist moments, but not because of intended comedy, which is none, but due to one of Leonardo Di Caprio's most interesting and charming characters, Frank William Abagnale, all combined with the hilarious moments.

This movie also features Christopher Walken in almost his best acting performance, as Frank Abagnale. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", Walken touches us only by saying a few words, and so, he is simply magnificent. Furthermore, we have Tom Hanks, which fits perfectly in his role. A no-sense-of-humor federal agent, devoted and implicated in finishing his task? Hanks is definitely the best choice.

To conclude, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is another entertaining, effortlessly watchable Steven Spielberg film, that catches us in a lot of positive ways.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best",43748,luke-a-mcgowan,27 March 2016,"Steven Spielberg frequently adds the father-son element into his films, but rarely is it as strong as it is in this movie. It never stops being flashy and fun as Abagnale embezzles and defrauds his way around the country, but Spielberg wedges that family angle in there and suddenly the film changes. It becomes about a boy in denial of his parents breaking apart and he thinks that by getting all this money he can push them back together. For all of his fake titles and wealth, he's just a sad kid trying to make his father proud of him.

DiCaprio's performance is essential to that focus. He's a perfectly glitzy casting choice to play someone who weaves his way through the world on his charms, but his emotional distress at the shattering of his world is much more important. Of a hefty supporting cast, Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr, an infinite sadness appearing in his piercing eyes as he observes his renegade son during their many meetings. Amy Adams is a delight as the bracey, ugly duckling Brenda, and Martin Sheen adds considerable heft to the film as her father. Tom Hanks goes toe to toe with DiCaprio all throughout and makes for some of the best moments.

All of the con scenes are superbly written, directed and shot, with lingering shots on DiCaprio's unblinking charm and clever movements disguising things to be hidden. The first meeting between Hanks and DiCaprio is a classic scene in its own right. The dialogue is so clipped and so well-written that it seems perfectly reasonable not to, say, open a wallet or trust a man's word. The scene in which DiCaprio escapes through a police blockade is superb, with the camera focusing on all the minute clues and then ending with that plane takeoff. The whole thing is timed to perfection.

Catch Me If You Can is an absolute blast to watch with a big bag of popcorn, but its also an impressive work of dramatic film that ranks with Spielberg's best.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch It Anywhere It Is Shown.,43718,anaconda-40658,20 March 2016,"Catch Me If You Can (2002): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams: Clever true story of the things that compel us to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the youngest person to appear on the F.B.I. most wanted list. His father was arrested for tax fraud, which led to the loss of their home and a divorce soon afterwards. Frank splits and learns the art of impersonation and becomes an airline pilot, a professor, and a medical physician all while dodging the law. Great work by Steven Spielberg who also scored with Minority Report the same year. DiCaprio is superb with the impersonations and lifestyles as he attempts to elope as well as stay ahead of authority. Tom Hanks is funny as an F.B.I. agent propelled by his unwillingness to be outsmarted. This leads to a lot of humour and an unlikely respect. Christopher Walken is terrific as Frank's father whom himself was a fraud but not as successful as his son. His wife is having an affair, which trails to his unfortunate fate. Martin Sheen appears as a potential in-law who sees through DiCaprio. More of Sheen would have been great. Amy Adams plays a nurse whose abortion caused a division between herself and her parents until DiCaprio enters their lives. It seems to reference old spy films, and is styled similar to The Pink Panther and equally curious. Score: 9 / 10",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,A must-see,43718,operator-16,13 March 2016,"I liked almost everything of this movie. Acting is superb (Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Walken: do I need to say more?), Spielberg's direction is flawless, music is interesting and adds the right amount of tension.

The story tells of (real-world) con artist Frank Abagnale, of his complicate family and the reasons pushing him into a criminal life while still very young. The movie is brilliant, at times entertaining in showing how our reality is partly made of paperwork and false perceptions. At other times, I found it intense and emotional in representing the struggle of Frank's father to emerge from his low social condition out into the ""little club"" of those ""who have everything"". Overall the movie is very balanced and I would not have minded watching some 30 minutes more of it.

My advice: absolutely watch it, even multiple times to spot some more visual details.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A worthy man falls in his right place!,43718,muvi-fan-73,31 January 2016,"Catch me if you can is a movie about a con man played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The story portrays how he is close to his father, also via incidents where his mother takes him out via bail in bits and parts.

The nature of con that he is an expert at is fake paper work (mainly bank cheque's). When it comes to be a con his talent is unparallel. He cheats students, women, his family and government particularly. He is finally arrested and is freed in returning help to government. Officer who gets him caught adopts him as well.

Pros: Superb direction by Steven Spielberg as always, his movies with emotional content are worth praising (extra marks for that). Superb acting by all leads, highly powered -emotions and thrill between Frank Abagnale Jr. (con) and Officer Carl Hanratty, raise height of biography.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,This movie is the second mouse,43718,gere-c,1 December 2015,"Catch Me If You Can can be a smart movie, funny and at the same time light to watch. Its two hours and twenty go ""flying"", he does not feel, so much that you can have fun and hold this film.

He has a very good plot, with good performances - mainly DiCaprio and Christopher Walken -, DiCaprio because commanded sensationally the movie showing multiple identities, knowing to be a character with a lot of insight to act in many different ways and in many different situations. And Walken manages to come because he transpose his emotion in your life with a lot of problems. Tom Hanks had a good performance, but when I think of his performances in The Terminal or Forrest Gump, which were sensational, in Catch Me If You Can not seem so great, but also is very good.

The direction was very good. I'm no fan of Spielberg in particular, but I recognize that he has great movies, so that i've watched a lot and I liked the most. This was no different a light direction, which does not force the bar to the viewer. Knowing how to be smart, know how to be subtle, knows how to be funny. Although I found some unnecessary scenes on the life of Frank Jr., which lengthened a little movie, but nothing that hinders the viewer, the film still holding you from start to finish, no doubt.

Overall, this is it, it is nothing revolutionary in the cinema, but still, it's a great film by a great director, is very light to watch and you probably do not feel the time passing.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Perfection,43748,kevinthompson-42619,17 November 2015,"Catch Me If You Can ""is one of those movies that show exactly how good of a storyteller Steven Spielberg actually is. The strong feature of this film lies in the quality of its actors. The chemistry between the protagonists is extraordinary, and how could it not be when we have two leading men who do not stop to thrill us from project to project. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal as a very clever but emotionally weak guy, while Tom Hanks is brilliant as the agent and provides an excellent complement to Leo's character. Christopher Walken is really impressive in the role of Frank's father and gives a high quality performance. ""Catch Me If You Can"" contains all the elements a top film should possess.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Unlike it's main character, this film is exactly what it wants to be!",43718,kieranbattams,13 April 2015,"There are a lot of classics i have been wanting to see but haven't got the chance. I have had a lot recommended to me, whilst i watch a hell of a lot of movies i haven't seen them all. I recently got my hands on a copy of Catch Me if You Can and had high hopes. Afterall, i've heard nothing but praise for the movie and the two main stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are two of my all-time favourite actors, how could i not love this?! So i watched it.. and i love this film! It had me hooked in from beginning to end and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. It was a fun movie as well as one that just keeps you wanting to know more and guessing how it will end for the characters.. especially Leonardo Dicaprio's Frank Abangale Jr.

The plot follows Frank who leaves home at 16 after his parents divorce and poses as a pilot.. then a doctor.. then a lawyer.. all before he turns 21. I tell you, this guy has lived. Hot on his tail is an equally brilliant Tom Hanks as FBI detective Carl Hanratty who figures out Abangale's tricks through a series of fake cheques he is cashing out. This leads to an entertaining cat and mouse type movie full of twists and turns. The two actors play off of each other perfectly and are two completely different characters. What i like about Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal of Abengale is that he is an incredibly smart guy and he is so good at showing this without completely overplaying himself. Christopher Walken also does great as Abengale's father and adds some moral backbone to the twists and turns and we get a young Amy Adams who is also great as Abengale's love interest

Everybody in this film does great.. in fact.. even a Jennifer Garner cameo was awesome!

In the end, from the fitting music in the soundtrack to the animated opening sequence to the climax of the film everything was almost perfect and i will be watching this film a lot more times in my life because i had a great time and it really showcases why these 2 actors are 2 of the best working today. It comes highly recommended with the perfect blend of humour and entertainment.. if you haven't seen Catch me if you Can then see it now!",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Catch Me If You Can and my nostalgic, retrospective thoughts...",43748,Burny18,21 November 2014,"All of us have different opinions, especially about movies and women.. but this film is definitely an all time favorite of mine.

Every now and then you probably feel like me, watching the collection of your watchlist movies again and again, over and over, never feeling bored of the past, craving to go back in time, and wishing that you could just see it again for the first time. The years go by and we get older, and your watchlist grows. At least that is the case with mine. Ever since I joined IMDb I have added some films that I saw to my watchlist. Although I do admit sometimes I forget to add films that I already saw. So far during my lifetime I have watched over 1400 movies if not more and I can tell you with confidence that this film is not something that is going to disappoint you. Retrospectively, 2002, seems a long way back even if some people say 'Darling, its as if 2002 was just 'yesterday'. I cannot put it into the span of this box how much happened since then...But the one I recall most recently, is that I have lost one of my favorite actors and I still sometimes feel like crying when I watch his movies, speeches, and stand-ups...Robin Williams and also the Hungarian equivalent of him an actor called Imre Bajor. I tend to get nostalgic from time to time; if most of you would know my age you would probably say I am still very young for that.. However, I cannot forget the joy some of these films like CMIYC gave me and the feelings that it conjured up in me as I was growing up. Catch Me If You Can ensures that the viewer is experiencing never ending excitement, thrill, and pure entertainment. This is mostly due to the fact that the script is extremely well written and tailored immaculately to the characters, and it all becomes realistic. The performance by the three major actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken is truly off the charts. You know when sometimes you have a movie or TV-show where the cast just fits exactly like a puzzle? Well, I do and these three are meant to be on screen together as it is in Catch Me If You Can. In this film Tom Hanks is persevered,Christopher Walken is Mysterious as usual, and Leaonardo DiCaprio.. the lad who is an adventurer.

I do believe Hollywood should aim to go back towards making movies like this, I personally despise the fact and find it vile that we have all these supernatural, fantasy, space movies. I was never really a fan of Star Trek or any other 'battlestar galatica' movies...and hopefully, someday they will indeed produce films that are of such quality as CMIYC.

If you have not seen this movie yet...then waste no more time searching for another film to watch this December, or on this Sunday afternoon... and if you already seen it then you know how it is good and the environment which it should be watched in. To make it ideal...

I usually get some wood logs from outside, put it in the Fire place, get a hot chocolate, some popcorn/pistachios and lay back in your usual seat on the couch. For me it just matches the movie to watch it during the winter season... and if there is snow outside and you can hardly see out from your windows then you know its time.

I know that I did not provide any details to the plot or described what the movie is about, but I hope I got you into the zone of having a relaxed afternoon and I shared true honest feelings with you about how I feel when I watch movies.

Thank you so much for reading this 'review', (More like a 5 minute monologue) BD",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,I love it,43748,mn310-89-267537,24 August 2014,"One of the great movies. Great actors. The best thing about this movie is that it is based on a true story. It is about a kid who is good at making fake checks and earning millions of dollars by pretending to work in different jobs. The first job was that he pretended to be a sub teacher at age 17. Then his father lost his business and the family had lost their house and became broke. When that happened the parents got divorced and the kid wasn't happy about it. So he ran away and depend on himself. He became so professional at making fake checks. He once pretended to be a co-pilot at Pan American World Airways. Then he pretended to be a doctor and a lawyer. While making fake checks the FBI started to notice that the kid had stolen millions of dollars and FBI started looking for the kid. That is why the name of the movie is Catch Me If You Can. Because all this time the FBI had been trying to catch him and they funny thing is that he got caught not in the United States, he got caught in France. I recommend this movie to everyone who are a fan of Tom Hanks.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A complete laughter and entertainment dose !!,43687,ankitapasricha2209,21 August 2014,"This movie is a remarkable work by Spielberg. It is based on the true life story of Frank William Abagnale Jr. who himself plays a minor role in the movie as a French policeman. This only adds to the fascination and awe while watching the movie. The movie depicts how Frank disguises first as an Airline Pilot, then a doctor and later as a lawyer without any professional training in any of these fields. He was able to con a huge sum of money from various government authorities all around the world through his fake degrees, qualifications, payroll cheques etc. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Frank in the film was terrific and Tom Hanks' role as an FBI agent only adds to it. Frank's character in the film makes it seem absolutely believable that a man like him can lie, deceive and con almost everyone he meets. The most interesting part is to watch Frank disguise as a school teacher in high school so effortlessly . It is also amusing to watch him get away from the Airport so easily with eight of his selected stewardesses despite the presence of over a hundred officers at the Airport.

Overall, it is an exciting movie to watch that kept me engrossed throughout the movie. However, I feel that the movie very quickly digresses from the serious topics such as separation of the family, divorce, bankruptcy and their impact on the character of Frank although these were the real driving factors due to which he resorted to such a deceitful lifestyle. Also, the fact that Frank ends up well off in life even after he was caught, sort of glorifies his lifestyle. It is always a very pleasant change from the usual serious films to watch a bit of escapism and complete unrestricted freedom without instigating an inward desire to lead such a lifestyle.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,catch me if you can,43687,inneke_vierendeel,26 March 2014,"Release date: 25 December 2002 Lenght: 141 minutes Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken & Martin Sheen Director: Steven Spielberg Producer: Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes Distributor: Dreamworks SKG Music: John Williams Screenplay writer: Jeff Nathanson, Stan Redding & Frank Abagnale

'Catch me if you can' is a crime drama film based on a true story. The movie is about the life of Frank Abagnale who had a very complicated life. There is a lot of action in this movie and it's really not boring. The movie was a success and also the real Frank Abagnale really liked the movie .

The movie is about a young man (Frank Abagnale) who is good at pretending to be someone else. One day his parents decide to divorce and Frank need to choose with which parent he wants to live. Frank doesn't want to make that decision and runs away. He doesn't have a lot of money so he starts to forge checks. He is very good in forging stuff so he forged his pilot certificate and became a co-pilot. The FBI discovers all the forged checks and they start to look for him without knowing who he really is and what he looks like. Carl Hanratty is an FBI fraud bank agent and he really wants to catch Frank, but catching Frank is not as easy as he thought. Meanwhile it gets a little risky for Frank to be a pilot so he decide to change jobs and he becomes a doctor. Frank is not afraid of the FBI and keeps forging checks and papers, but can he keep doing that?

The leadactor in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio has played a role in many movies like 'Titanic', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'The great gatsby'  Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Frank Abagnale in the movie and I think he is the perfect actor for that. The other leadactor is Tom Hanks. He has the role of the FBI-agent. Also Tom Hanks plays his role perfect, I think DiCaprio and Hanks are the perfect combination to make a movie together.

'Catch me if you can' is the perfect movie for people who like a little bit action, the movie is easy to understand and besides it is based on a true story! The storyline is really good and the actors are perfect for this movie, I would recommend this movie to everybody that I know!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,The movie leaves its taste on your filmy buds..,43718,jadejasidharaj,27 March 2014,"Catch Me If You Can

Listening the name of the movie at first, it didn't interest me much. But I had a damn keen interest in it. Tom Hanks +Leonardo DiCaprio and you get a direction from Steven Spielberg as a topping. What better a serving can you ask for.

First things first. Creativity of the movie takes you from the very first moment, when credits are shown. I mean thats what I love about Hollywood. They take their jobs so possessively. Even something as minor(in comparison to the hell lot of other things a movie includes) as starting credits are designed so creatively, so attractively, that you rarely see such stuff in the East. Then, talking about screenplay it was none the less just fabulous . You know movies of such kind..they make you feel right between those characters. You never feel you aren't a part of that movie. Such is the beauty of all the hard work, that even though watching it at mid night with college the next day,you don't feel to pause it for a moment. The guts of Frank William Abagnale are what took me by awe. His confidence he puts into whatever he says or does. Bravo to the thought improvisation in the script. And what brilliant execution.

What next hit hard was the relation between Carl(Tom Hanks) and Frank (Leo).When you are an ace thief the most faithful and trustworthy relation you can and you have is with the agent chasing you.It is true and is strong. Both of you stay committed to each other yet against each other.Also, this one really shows that you are what you believe at that moment.! Nothing else.

The end again had its complete touch and the few facts shown at the end about Mr. Frank added even more to what the movie had successfully portrayed. Loved it totally. And glad watched it.. ;)

Tom Hanks as always is lovable and even though you give him lesser screen space, he makes his presence felt so serenely. Leo . Well, watching his movies till yet and now this one, I'll just say he is one of those actors who are of a different league and always keep evolving themselves. Always Always fascinate you.! You just feel happy about yourself for watching them doing what they do best.!

Glorious movie.Must watch!!Steven Spielberg has done yet another simply amazing work directing this one.!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,The Satisfying Ironic: A Critical Review of Catch Me If You Can,43748,katehutton19,8 December 2013,"This film is a thoughtfully arranged drama-biographical narrative based on the life story of Mr. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. that tag-lines as, ""The true story of a real fake"". Although this story lacks violence, blood, murder, and other stereotypical understandings of this genre, this film reinforces its true crime integrity through the criteria use of narrative style, the text at the finale, the explanation for the evil, and the psychological understanding of this true, blue collar crime. All in all, this 2002 film, Catch Me If You Can, directed by Steven Spielberg cleverly captures the loopholes found in the criminal justice system, not only in the police force but the Federal Bureau of Investigation, making this film a true crime reflection as well as an explanation as to why the accessibility of actual criminal minds is necessary in these judicial forces to ensure safety and justice. This film is not only well written, entertaining, and includes a star-studded cast, but it also has a deeper meaning, a real life application, and new ideas for the viewer to think about after the credible finale; therefore ultimately earning my vote of a full, ten out of ten production.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Very well done, Entertaining and informative surprisingly heartfelt.",43718,marcusdipollina,24 November 2013,"I enjoyed this movie very much, it was entertain and suspenseful and had a very humanitarian message to it in the end. I felt that all the base were covered extremely well and the the movie actually had a good sense of humor about it as well. the casting was excellent and the Details in the costumes were executed with fantastic accuracy. the was a big swagger to the way DiCaprio played Abgnale and It made him the most endearing con man ever to hit the silver screen. Tom Hanks was a Hilariously Grumpy and feeling Carl Hanratty He made The Triumph of justice just as cool as the con man escaping the law. If there is one thing that I would like to see the movie do more of, It would be adding more grit to the tone of the movie. Not a lot The movie doesn't any disembowelment scenes but just to give the feeling that he really was criminal. the tone of the movie i feel just dampens the severaity of what he has done. and that really is my only complaint.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Inspiring.,43687,felixshreds,6 October 2013,"This review contains spoilers. - I've watched this movie several times. I remember seeing it the first time. Being astounded by the brilliance of DiCaprio's character and by the intelligent storytelling, I directly decided to write this review.


Frank is a rebel. He thinks outside the box and therefore realizes the weakness of the system. With a morally questionable attitude towards authority and routine, he decides to live a dangerous and permanently altering life. The life of a genius, however a liar - an ambivalent personality whose actions can be evaluated and assessed controversially.

The story is developed nicely. Starting with a funny exposition in which Frank's unusual, yet clever behavior is shown, Spielberg continues by illustrating the inciting incident to a rare career. A divorce! This is the aspect of this movie that is the most interesting one. Divorces have become such a regular thing. Why would such a daily happening event effect so greatly on an intelligent person? This circumstance can only be reasoned by the idiosyncrasies of Frank Abergnale's character. Although his brilliance and his rebellion let him appear as an emotionally cold, completely rational person, the cause of all his decisions lays in a very psychological and emotional event. Suddenly this movie seems to be rather a psychological study on an insurrectionist, than a regular crime story.

This is the point where Hanks' character comes into play. This character implies antagonism, thus adds a whole amount of suspense to the story. Let me ignore all the often discussed coincidental scenes of confrontation in this film at that point. Hanks' occurrence adds a duality to the story. And at the end, somehow Hanks and DiCaprio become friends and partners. Despite the fact that they act against each other, there never is hatred or greed in their relationship. They just play their social roles as a rebel and as a detective. It's a socially required rivalry. This is also the reason for which they are able to peacefully work together at the end. The movie documents the genesis of a rare friendship, which was used to be avoided by the existence of social roles.

I comprehend this movie as a sociological study, due to the fact that it shows extraordinary characters in typical social roles, as well as social dynamics that we all know.

Visually this movie is well made. Well directed, well written, well acted - but cinematically there is no specialty that needs to be pointed out especially. The brilliance of this piece consists in the topic it deals with.

Thanks for reading, watch this movie and relate yourself to the characters and it will inspire you!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,An emotional thriller!,43718,faizermohomed5,20 August 2013,"The title of the movie may suggest a cat and mouse game between two individuals, but there is more to it! This a movie that portrays the relationship between a young boy who yearns for parental love & care and a middle aged police officer who is away from his child. Although the basic plot is the conflict between a young, brilliant con man and a cool & composed police officer, the emotional struggle both of them endure as a result of their troubled relationships with their respective families is beautifully woven around the plot by the virtuoso STEVEN SPIELBERG! The movie is highly recommended for mass (who prefer thrills) as well class (who embrace meaningful cinema) audience!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me...,43718,ashi-lance,6 February 2013,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic movies like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and E.T., yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film, perhaps more as we see him in 2nd lead Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly. When his parents file for divorce and he has to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each step he takes. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. He is able to do all these sort of crimes inspired by comic books and experiences he got from things around him. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse. Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the entire film length!! To be fair – the film didn't sets out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.

My Rating – 9/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"An Impressive Cast and a Well Thought Out Story,",43718,lesleyharris30,5 January 2013,"Catch Me If You Can is an amazing movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is beautifully directed by Steven Spielberg, who puts so much detail, thought and scope in to every scene. No moment feels lazy, no location feels ""chosen at random"", everything is beautifully put together with great energy and dedication. This story seemed like a very complicated one to put together in to a movie that is easy for a modern day audience to understand, and the entire cast and crew managed to do so in a way that made it look effortless.

There are moments where things get a little dull. There are long periods where everything is very fast paced, and there is absolutely no problem with that however, it will then suddenly stop to add humanity to its characters and develop them further, but it is underwhelming to a degree that the audience feels cheated after how much action we had been given prior. It had pacing issues at times.

The performances are flawless, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the mischievous, charming Frank Abagnale Jr. and Tom Hanks brings in great characterisation, as well as a beautiful screen presence, as Carl Hanratty. What makes this movie so enjoyable it that it has two stories in which two of Hollywoods greatest actors are the main characters, and it's impossible to get bored when we are jumping back and forth from a Hanks movie to a DiCaprio vehicle.

A well developed, intriguing story. Well acted and developed, Catch Me If You Can is a largely entertaining movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film.

The true story of how Frank Abagnale Jr. forged millions of dollars worth of checks as he faked his name and pretends to be a pilot, doctor and other occupations across the state.

Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"He wasn't a pilot, a doctor a lawyer but he posed as all three",43687,Tweekums,1 January 2013,"In the opening scenes we see protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. as he appears as a guest on a television show; then we flash back several years and see him being extradited from France by FBI agent Carl Hanratty we then go even further back and start to see how an apparently ordinary teenager would become the most wanted fraudster in America. He leaves home when his parents' marriage fails then tries to cash cheques but nobody will except a cheque from an unknown teenager; then he hits upon an idea; he will become an airline pilot! Not a real pilot of course but with a uniform and a fake ID getting cheques cashed is easy; he also learns that it can get him free flights on other airlines. As he racks up the miles and cashes more and more cheques Agent Hanratty takes an interest in him and at one point almost catches him. It is time to hang up the uniform but Frank isn't going to stop his game; he spends time working as a doctor and then a lawyer before he is forced to run; eventually he is caught of course we'd seen that at the beginning. That isn't the end of Frank's story though .

This is essentially a caper movie with Frank trying one scheme after another; if we weren't told it was based on fact many parts would be unbelievable if it weren't for the way Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank as a person with extreme confidence. We get an hilarious example of this early on when Frank arrives at a new school and passes himself off as a substitute teacher for two weeks! Equally good is Tom Hanks' portrayal of the dogged Agent Henratty. There are well known actors doing fine jobs in minor roles too; these include Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. The story contains plenty of laugh out loud moments and little to offend although some may consider it somewhat amoral as Frank is such a likable character it is easy to want him to get away with his crimes! Overall I'd say that this was well worth watching; it may be over two hours long but that time just flew by.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,One of the best performances by DiCaprio.....,43687,ashwinikumar170,27 December 2012,"Actually there is not very much in the movie to be spoiled. What the movie is about is expressed in the beginning. Based on the true story, it covers the the life of con man and how FBI Agent hunts him down. The con man is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who impersonates a pilot and few other personalities while FBI Agent is played by great actor Tom Hanks.

Movie has all the elements that makes it a must watch. Even this more than 2 hr long movie, it is too much fun. It is very different from all the Steven Spielberg films that you will see. It has a distinct type of humor in the scenes of the movie, kind-of situation based.

As far as acting performance is concerned, all the viewers will be amazed. DiCaprio's performance is so good that you will want for his character in the to succeed. Tom Hanks as always gives a stunner. He is a kind of actor who plays different characters every time giving the audience a variety.

To sum up why you should see this film:

1.If you are fan of DiCaprio or Tom Hanks there is no reason why you should not see the film. 2.If you are tired of watching movies based on serious subjects, then this will offer you something different as well as pleasant. 3.It is a "" Steven Spielberg "" film.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A smart and educated Crime movie,43687,ron_capuccino,24 September 2012,"I didn't really know what to expect when I started to watched this movie. Probably something interesting and fast, based on a true story, benefiting from spielber's experience, but, I just wasn't sure it it would be good.

and in my case it was a good surprise.

Di Caprio and Hanks are playing at a good level. Most of situations are credible, this could haven happen more or less this way.

The secondary carachters like di caprio's mother and fathers are not much developed but that give chance to faster pace and doesn't really harm the viewer involment with the main character. We can kind of understand what pushed the situation to start and develop this way.

There is also no glorification of crimes or criminal, Tom Hanks also doesn't represent a model saint cops leading a crusade against check forgers.

All in one, the story of two opposite personalities, with somehow similar wound and weaknesses, a ""smart"" crime movie, shown in a fast pace story telling and realistic environment made me arrive at the end to think ""is that already finished"", which doesn't happens often in my case.

Would recommend it without hesitations.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Such a good movie.,43718,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,14 September 2012,"""Based on a true story"" as a selling point has gone severely downhill. Because it's a marketing term and by no means verifiable, there has been an influx of movies with the 'salesbait' (which is my own term) attached. But this is a movie which really defines ""based on a true story"". As I read in the trivia, there are several parts of the movie which were redone or removed to keep the film as true-to-life as possible. Of course, this is going off Frank Abagnale Jr.'s own word, so you should take that with a few grains of salt.

About the movie itself: it's longer than it probably needs to be. I don't have anything against long movies, but eventually this turned into ""who else can Frank prank?"". Tom Hanks is perfect, Tom Hanks' accent is beautimous, and Tom Hanks' attitude is a close third for my favorite actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was fine as a main character, but I couldn't help imagining this turning into ""Inception"". Oh well, I guess that's just a testament to his acting style.

All-in-all, one of my favorite movies. Definitely take the time to watch it.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,when lies grow out of control,43687,Marc_Israel_365,3 June 2012,"This story begins with the pathetic daring do and fall of a father (Christopher Walken) and the equally disturbing ways of a cheating mother. Clearly, Leo DiCarprio's young Frank Abignale Jr, was both as innocent as he was desperate, as cunning as he was naively idealistic. This fascinating watch wonderfully captures the late 1960's and your imagination. From New Rochelle, NY to a worldwide impostor on the run, we see Frank on an amazing journey all the while being chased by FBI paper hanger agent Carl Hanratty, who is marvelously enlivened by a frustrated but determined Tom Hanks. Knock knock! This game of deception is a lot of fun to watch.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Catch Me If You Can (2002) - I Think The Title Just Says it All! Way to Go for Making Obvious Titles, Spielberg!",43748,nickmesafilms,14 January 2012,"Based on the biographical true story and novel of con Frank Abagnale, Jr., this comedy-drama, directed by the amazing Steven Spielberg, is a look in the process of cons, criminals, and money scams. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, giving the best performance of his career, as Frank Abagnale, Jr., who successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars, way before his 19th birthday. He was able to accomplish this crime by posing as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, and a prosecutor. Since his primary crime was check fraud, Tom Hanks and the rest of the FBI are trying catch this maniac. This is truly one of Spielberg's best films, and I think I already knew that I would love it. Steven Spielberg delivers a fine directing job in this movie, and he truly knocked the ball out of the park once again. As for the acting, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the entire movie as Frank Abagnale, Jr., and he should have received a Best Actor nomination. Tom Hanks is just awesome in this movie, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who tries to catch Abagnale and throw him into custody. Amy Adams is pleasant in this film as DiCaprio's nurse girlfriend, and Christopher Walken brings his classic ""nice guy"" attitude in an Oscar-nominated performance as Abagnale's father. Once again, this is another classic Spielberg collaboration, and it has never looked better. John Williams makes a classic original score, Janusz Kaminski creates fine cinematography, Michael Kahn delivers unique film editing, and Jeff Nathanson has created such a brilliant well-written script that really recreates the life of this regular criminal. This movie is filled with surprising drama, some funny laughs, and some brilliant touching moments that only the greatness of Spielberg can provide. This movie was so brilliant, that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. This is one of Spielberg's finest films, and it's a memorable favorite.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Leonardo DiCaprio + Tom Hanks + Steven Spielberg = one good movie,43718,colebt33-780-179547,7 July 2010,"If you were sixteen and ran away from home, what would you do? Work an honest job with lousy pay? Go crawling back to your parents? Or would you do what Frank Abignale did? fly all over the world and cheat banks out of millions of dollars.

Catch Me If You Can tells the incredible true story of the kid who became one of the most wanted con mans in American history. Starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio this is a slick, good looking, and intelligently funny movie that ranks up with some of Steven Spielberg's best work.

Frank Abignale (Leonardo DiCaprio) lives what would seem like a perfect middle-class life, but when his father is convicted by the IRS for bank fraud things start to fall apart. His parents file for divorce and he has to choose whose custody he is going to be put in. So what does he do? he runs, and with high intentions of getting his family back together, after all isn't that what every kid wants? Frank went from forging fake cheques to eventually becoming a co-pilot for PanAm American Airways, a supervising MD, and assistant prosecutor, by the end stealing up to 5 million dollars. For a time he thought he was untouchable, but FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is keen to put him behind bars, and so the story of the cat and the mouse begins.

While the two are hardly on screen together they do share an amusing relationship. The cat and mouse are two very different, but also very similar creatures. Both had lost families to a divorce and as much as they wish they could have it back they both realize that you have to grow up. DiCaprio pulls of the best performance since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", another recommendable movie. Tom Hanks excels exceptionally well as the uptight agent in heavy pursuit of the criminal and Christopher Walken plays the very good optimistic father figure.

One thing I found ridiculous was Steven's depiction of how easy it was to get a job in the 60's. Frank would simply observe the terminology of various occupations presented in movies and perform them in the facility where the practice is conducted. This gets me thinking of how much of this movie is actually fictionalized.

However in spite of that this is still one the most outrageous, scandalist, funny stories I have ever seen, and what makes it even better is knowing that it actually happened. A bit too long a movie considering the plot line, but that can easily be forgiven when you're watching it because those 2 hours will just fly by.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Fun, Witty, like a Tom and Jerry Movie!!",43687,conyemenam,1 June 2010,"I love Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio in this film. Tom Hanks was so funny, even in his overly serious character. ""Knock Knock"" -- ""Go f*** yourselves"". He looked so foolish when he was beaten by the Secret Service act, and yet so smart and accomplished when apprehending Abagnale in France. In fact, talking of France, DiCaprio acts that scene so naturally, you don't feel, but you understand his willingness for all this to end. The music added to the fun, Spielberg was fantastic, I was shocked that the film came out in 2002, he actually put the watcher in that 19'-something world!!! I love DiCaprio most, not because of the class of his acting, but the youth he managed to put into it. He makes Frank so young and smart at the same time!! He isn't serious, he is a smiling, loving, playboy, and he really gets the audience hunting for what his next stunt, next quick escape is going to be. Film is good, highly recommended. Nice storyline e.t.c. The truth is, i don't know exactly what to say, but you should go watch it and see for yourself.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Why this movie is not in IMDb Top 250?,43687,Tapan_india,25 April 2010,"This films belongs to Di Caprio. The portrait of Frank Abagnale Jr. by Caprio is amazing and interesting. The movie begins with three impostor of Frank Abagnale with Caprio being the one. Then it shows how Frank becomes a criminal by forging checks after the divorce of his parents. Frank poses as a co-pilot and forges payroll checks and succeeds in stealing over 2.8 million dollars. He also impersonate as a doctor and an assistant prosecutor.

Tom Hanks plays a humorless FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, who begins to track down Frank. Then begins the cat and mouse game. The scene in which Frank calls Carl for the first time is really interesting. Frank tells him that he is sorry that Carl could not catch him in their first meet, to which Carl replies that Frank has called him because there is no one else whom he can call. The film confirms Di Caprio as a fine actor.

Catch me if you can is another jewel in Spielberg's crown.I fail to understand why this movie is not in the list of Top 250 IMDb films. Don't miss this movie. Its a masterpiece with top notch acting and direction. I would go with 8.0/10 for 'Catch me if you Can'. Go Catch it at the earliest if you still haven't.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Very entertaining, and quite clever at the same time",43687,tomb_92,13 April 2010,"I was really surprised when I saw this. I wasn't expecting it so be so good. First of all the story is really interesting and really entertaining at the same time- something very rarely seen these days. Secondly, the performances are excellent, Leonardo DiCaprio in this sort of role where he actually acts instead of just looking pretty (Titanic springs to mind) is really a joy to watch. Also, Christopher Walken is excellent and Tom Hanks does that thing that he does which is to pull off an extremely good performance without actually trying. Lastly, I just want to say the music was brilliant- I'm really a big fan of John Williams. So, when it all comes together this really is a joy to watch, it's emotional, emotional, funny, witty, and very clever. An refreshingly not too long.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"An all-around perfect mixture of fun, drama and suaveness",43748,hyper777,20 March 2010,"This is such an all-around exciting, fun movie that you could watch over and over again and never tire of. It's an interesting, light-hearted look at the true story of an extremely clever con artist, and full of great performances. Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding an honest, bittersweet quality to the movie, and his relationship with his son made for the most moving scenes of the film. Tom Hanks has the perfect dry wit in his role of Carl Hanratty, and his portrayal of the somewhat nerdy, striving foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's smooth character created a lot of comedic moments.

And of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr., as he is in all of his roles. He really lets us see the humanity of the character and why he was the way he was, as well as does a great job in a more comedic role, different from the dark ones he usually tends to take on. He's the perfect mixture of suave, boyish and troubled that this character needs to be believable, and he pulls it off amazingly.

In brief, this movie is something really different and incredibly interesting. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating, intelligent man with a true story that is both funny and full of real emotion, and these actors and director take it into their hands in the most perfect way. Definitely a must see.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg's Most Successful Comedy,43687,JamesHitchcock,3 September 2009,"Films directed by Steven Spielberg tend to fall into two categories.

On the other, there are those would-be Big Movies about Big Subjects like racism (""The Color Purple"", ""Amistad""), war (""Empire of the Sun"", ""Saving Private Ryan""), the Holocaust (""Schindler's List"") and life after death (""Always"").

""Catch Me If You Can"", however, does not fall easily into either category. It is a light-hearted comedy based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who, while still in his teens, successfully impersonated a Pan-Am pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and who managed to dishonestly obtain millions of dollars through cheque fraud. He was so skillful that after his arrest and imprisonment the FBI secured his release on parole so that he could work for them as a counter- forgery expert. He is today a millionaire, having made his fortune as a consultant advising banks on how to counter cheque forgery.

This was the first film which really convinced me that Leonardo DiCaprio could act. Previously I had not always been his greatest admirer; he struck me as an untalented pretty-boy when I first saw him in ""Titanic"", and there was little in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Beach"" or ""Gangs of New York"" to persuade me to change my mind. Here, however, he was able to turn his boyish good looks to good use. He was 28 when the film was made, but always seems credible as a teenager- an important point, as Frank's youth is a vital element in the film.

The film is set in the 1960s, the period which has gone down in popular culture as the Age of Youth or the Age of Rebellion. (This is emphasised by the animated opening title sequence, a witty pastiche of those favoured by sixties filmmakers). Frank's form of rebellion, of course, is rather different to those who were protesting against Vietnam or in favour of the legalisation of cannabis, but he can nevertheless still be seen as a youthful rebel. The main influence on him is his father Frank Abagnale Sr, a businessman who has got into trouble with the authorities because of a series of tax frauds, which have led to the family living in poverty and to the breakdown of his marriage. Frank Jr sees his father as being the victim of unjust persecution by the authorities, and resolves to continue his father's war against ""the system"". It is notable that Frank Jr is from a broken home, as divorce and family breakdown seems to be something of a Spielberg trademark. (Ray Ferrier, the protagonist of ""War of the Worlds"", is for example a divorcée).

DiCaprio here succeeds in the difficult task of making a criminal seem sympathetic. It helps, of course, that Abagnale's crimes were non-violent and that his main victims were large corporations, but the main reason why he is the hero of this film and not the villain is his youth. What in an older man would seem like rank dishonesty becomes, in a teenager, an almost admirable nerve and daring. Frank carries off his deceptions with such style and aplomb, remarkable in one so young, that we see him as a likable rogue rather than a villain.

There is a curious relationship between Abagnale and Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent charged with tracking him down. Whereas Frank is quick-witted and formidably intelligent, Hanratty seems slow and plodding. Although Frank outwits him on a number of occasions, Carl continues to pursue him with dogged determination. Although the two men are on opposite sides of the law, there is nevertheless a bond between them. Both are loners; Hanratty is obsessively dedicated to his work, although he is well aware that bank fraud, his specialist area, is not regarded as glamorous or particularly important by his colleagues in the Bureau. A curious ritual develops whereby Frank calls Carl every year on Christmas Eve. It is perhaps unsurprising that the two eventually become friends after Frank's release from jail.

DiCaprio receives good support from Tom Hanks as the dogged Hanratty, Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen in a cameo role as the father of Frank's girlfriend Brenda. (She is a nurse in the hospital where he is posing as a doctor). The film may not have the moral worthiness of some of Spielberg's Big Subject movies, but it is witty, stylish, fast-moving and often amusing. In my view it is Spielberg's most successful attempt at comedy. 8/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,good one!,43687,muditmonfils,30 August 2009,"The Steven Spielberg-Tom Hanks pair are known for making one of the most entertaining movies on Earth. Their movies are generally long in duration, very narrative, simple and most importantly very entertaining. Some of the great examples of their movies are: Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal and now Catch Me If You Can. Steven Spielberg's unpredictable story idea together with Tom Hanks raw talent make an Oscar worthy combination.

I had always wanted to watch this flick ever since I read about it back in 2002. I never came across any of it's television broadcast. So finally out of frustration I bought the DVD. Catch Me If You Can is about a character called Frank Abagnale Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who starts cheating on people and in the course of time becomes the biggest conman of USA. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an FBI detective who is determined to put an end to Abagnale's activities. After being duped by Abagnale at a hotel, Carl gets an idea about the perfection of Abagnale in duping people.

Every actor in this movie is flawless. I was really impressed by Leonardo's performance first as a troubled young student and later as a full blown conman. Tom Hanks together with Christopher Walken adds spice to the movie. Tom's presence in any movie sets the mood of the audience. Martin Sheen is good too but his screen time is very less. Amy Adams was very natural in her acting. Spielberg really picks up the right actor for the right role.

Catch Me If You Can is a great light popcorn flick with heavy emotions. It sets the tempo right from the beginning.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Flash of Lightning from Leonardo DiCaprio,43687,wes-connors,2 August 2009,"""Flash"" comic book reader Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) is devastated when he learns loving parents Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye (as Frank and Paula Abagnale) are divorcing. Unable to choose whom he'd rather to live with, Mr. DiCaprio decides to run away, like DC Comics' ""The Flash"". A natural impersonator, DiCaprio assumes a secret identity, and develops amazing check-forging skills. This attracts the attention of FBI agent Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty), who is determined to put DiCaprio behind bars. Incredibly, DiCaprio gets jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. But, Mr. Hanks is hot on his trail

""Catch Me If You Can"" finds Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks team in the middle of an incredible string of well-produced films. When seen in context, their success secret may be offering the public a variety of entertainment, alternating the familiar with the unexpected. ""Catch Me If You Can"" isn't rollicking, inspirational, or filled with special effects; it's just wildly appealing. Spielberg regulars: cameraman Janusz Kaminski, musician John Williams, editor Michael Kahn, etc are ""state of the art"" in film-making. The cast performs exceptionally. Most valuable player Williams is especially noteworthy, helping an incredible opening ""credits"" sequence start the film.

In hindsight, this may be considered one of DiCaprio's very best performances. Certainly, it's one of the only times when casting a 10-years-too-old actor in a part makes perfect sense, as you'll see upon viewing this film. DiCaprio fits the role like a glove, handling his character's charming to disillusioned development with precision. The character is extremely likable. Spielberg sets the perfect mood by opening the film with a ""To Tell the Truth"" game show appearance, and flashback. We know approximately how the film will end; but, like a ""Flash"" comic book story, we enjoy the adventure, and feel the danger.

Obviously, they were going for a ""PG-13"" audience; and, the sex scenes aren't offensive. The one following DiCaprio's viewing of the James Bond film ""Goldfinger"" is particularly well done. It involves his encounter with a high-class prostitute. By returning to DiCaprio viewing the film, back in the theater, the entire sequence could be artfully turned into a fantasy. This would support the very idealized way DiCaprio views relationships; they should be like comic book couple, like Barry and Iris Allen. Our hero fantasizes he's ""James Bond"", but he's really very ""old-fashioned"". He can't accept his parents' break-up; and, has idealized, failed relationships with women.

There is some thoughtfulness as ""Catch Me If You Can"" explores the relationships DiCaprio's ""Frank"" has with his parents and Mr. Hanks. The film would be stronger if the protagonist's innocent idealism and ideology were more developed. A key moment, for ""Frank"", is when he discovers his parents are not the perfect couple he (and we viewers) have been accustomed to seeing. Later, after a period of promiscuity, our hero has his failed relationship. He learns couples are not like idealized; but, this thread of the film lacks a proper conclusion; a scene with mother Baye, or the introduction of a new romantic interest, would help.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Really smart movie,43748,Rocktank21,27 April 2009,"To tell the truth, for a long time I rejected to watch the movie, as I didn't like 50-60's movies at all, no matter what actor staff plays. So, one day, I took the DVD of ""Catch me if you can"" out of my bookshelf, (it was dusty, cos no one touched it for a long time). Began watching... and, bum! I fell in love with it! Especially I liked Leonardo so much! I just couldn't stand him before, you know! So, this movie completely changed my mind about both Leonardo DiCaprio and 50-60's movies. Movie's excellence is provided by: -at first, talents of actors, especially, DiCaprio, Tom Hanks; -at second, extremely interesting and intriguing screenplay.

Well, watch it and enjoy!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Amazing Con Artitst,43748,shawn_sk,8 April 2009,"This movie portrays life of Frank Abagnale Jr. who before his 19th birthday posed as a teacher, lawyer, doctor and airline pilot. He was one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters, and escape artists in history. Throuout his teen years he had commit bank frauds and collected almost 2.5 million dollars. The character Frank Abagnale is played be Leonardi diCaprio who has done an excellent job playing Frank and also Carl Hanratty who is a FBI bank fraud agent played by Tom Hanks. Hanratty mission was to track down Abangnale with his team and during the movie Frank even encountered FBI agent face to face but he failed to recognize that it was him. FBI agents were no match for this great con artitst. This is another Steven Spielberg's great hit and the story line and screen play in this movie is really enjoyable.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Fun Movie with Great Cast,43687,brando647,4 February 2009,"You can't really go wrong with a film from Steven Spielberg. I can't really think of a bad film the man has ever made, so you know to expect quality when you watch his movies; this 2002 Christmas release is no different. Inspired by a true story, the film follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the greatest con artists the United States has ever seen. Abagnale had posed as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer before he turned 21, cashing more than $2 million in fraudulent checks.

Jeff Nathanson based the screenplay on the book of the same name, written by Abagnale himself. The story covers so much and moves so fast, yet it never loses the audience or stumbles over itself. In the capable hands of Spielberg, the movie drives on at a good pace and keeps the audience interested throughout. In the end, it's the character of Abagnale that makes the movie so entertaining. At the time, I hadn't cared a whole lot for Leonardo DiCaprio in the past but this movie changed that a bit. DiCaprio was a fan of Abagnale's book before the film ever came about, so his passion for the material shines through his performance. He also had great chemistry with Tom Hanks, who plays the FBI agent on his trail. We also get a strong supporting performance from Christopher Walken as Frank's father; despite his minimal screen time, it was enough to make an impression (and win some awards).

Knowing Spielberg spares no expense, you can also expect great production design. With the film set in the 1960's, it made for some colorful scenery. The movie does run a bit long (a little over two hours) but it isn't painful. It's a fun movie and Spielberg doesn't let you down; all I can do is recommend you check it out.",pos

the real Frank Abagnale Junior must have been brilliant to pull this off, passing for a lawyer, a doctor and a pilot! all under 19 years of age! i really love this movie!

it must have been terrible to have been the real brenda, with the abortion and everything!

this movie by Spielberg, i think, is one of his best!

it is so captivating

CatchMeIfYouCan,Just do the math,43687,MairegChernet,24 January 2009,"DiCaprio + Spielberg = Sheer brilliance.

Catch Me If You Can is another awesome flick by the legendary Steven Spielberg. And DiCaprio's top notch performance as the brilliant con master combined with Tom Hanks' amazing performance as the committed FBI agent illuminated the already shiny film. The film from beginning to end is filled with suspense and tense chase scenes. And the fact that it was set in the sixties gave it an archaic and classical touch. I admire and respect DiCaprio even more now. His tremendous acting skills are advancing with each passing film and we expect to see more from him.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Engaging,43687,neil-476,23 January 2009,"In some ways a rather slight film, Catch Me If You Can takes on considerable weight by virtue of the quality of the contributions made to it by its actors, writers, and director.

Tom Hanks and Leonardo di Caprio are always credible as the young fraudster and his dogged FBI pursuer and deliver performances of solid commitment, only to be outshone by Christopher Walken. The relationship between Walken (father) and di Caprio (son) is at the heart of this movie. The other cast members are all very good, too.

Which is not to say that the events covered aren't attention grabbing too. One watches open-mouthed at the effrontery, nerve, ingenuity, and sheer gall exhibited by someone who realises at a very young age that, if you're going to lie, lie big.

The 60s period detail feels authentic throughout.

This film was engaging, both in the everyday sense of being entertaining, but also in the sense that it fully engaged me throughout its 135 minutes running time. It wasn't a film I was in a hurry to see, but I now wish I hadn't waited so long! Recommended.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Great comedy, stirring drama - well done Spielberg, Di Caprio and Hanks!",43687,roses_are_red14,27 December 2008,"Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken star in this clever comedy by Steven Spielberg, based on the somewhat-true story of Frank Abagnale, a young American con-man.

I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film! I have never heard it praised in conversation, although I haven't heard it condemned either. It seems merely to have been released and then quickly faded into the dominant space of popular consciousness - sheer indifference. My low expectations were blown out of the water, however, as I found this film very engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking.

Di Caprio, as he so often does, provides a great visual hook in this film. Don't watch it expecting eye-candy; he plays a very lost 17 year old boy for the most part, and even if he is very successful with the ladies on screen, the camera views him as the boy he is, and therefore so does the audience. His performance is wonderful, and certainly pulled at my heartstrings. The character is brazen, reckless, selfish, irresponsible and deceitful, and yet never fails to win our sympathy. Likewise Tom Hanks is extraordinarily likable as a cop with no sense of humour, charisma, or incredible intelligence. Full credit to the actors for their ability to play deeply flawed characters with perfect empathy.

Catch Me If You Can is also thoroughly enjoyable for its charming visual style. The film is set in the 60s, and the immersion is complete. One of the bonuses of watching a tried-and-true director like Spielberg is that no expense is spared, and the bright and colourful sets and costumes are a great compliment to Frank's bold attitude, as well as being useful in their absence when muted down for more intimate scenes.

This film is charming in its humour and moving in its empathy, and really highlighted the subjectivity of our sense of justice. I think this is a great testament to the wonderful diversity of Spielberg.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Brilliant,43748,maria-512,15 May 2007,"A fascinating story made more so by the fact that it is based on actual events in the life of an actual person. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in this film - his first complete display of the truly sophisticated acting for which he has now come to be known, playing Frank Abagnale Jr.'s youthful awkwardness & uncertainty seamlessly beneath his cunning conman facade. Tom Hanks plays the perfect foil, giving his character believable tenacity, smarts, and the gritty pallor of a long-suffering public servant. The score was just wonderful - and the cinematography is easy to overlook in a story as compelling as this, but it would not have been so compelling without it.

Brilliantly played & written, based on an utterly fascinating life. I can't recommend this film highly enough.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg still continues to make good films,43687,Zlactoc,22 December 2006,"When I first saw Catch me if you Can, (Christmas 04) I was a little put off by it. My Dad said he didn't find it an enjoyable film, and that it was not one of Spielberg's better works. However, I am pleased to say I found the film immensely enjoyable, and would class it as one of my favorite films of all Time.

The cinematography is great, acting is superb, and the music is a lovely piece.

Although not sounding like your typical John Williams score, the music is another fantastic delivery from Mr. Williams. Not only does it make a great movie score, but it also makes good music to listen to in general (As opposed to pieces such as Star Wars and Superman.) Spielberg still continues to make good films, fun for everyone.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great! If you can handle it,43718,kellyanne1990,20 May 2006,"First time I saw it, I was twelve or thirteen with my boss and co-worker at a volunteering job. I didn't like it at first, but now I enjoy it. Leo Dicaprio plays sixteen year old Frank Abagnale Jr., a son of a French mother and an American father. He loves his parents dearly but can't stand the fact of his parents divorcing. The only thing he can do is run away from it. He imitates a school reporter, a pilot, a doctor, and then a lawyer which eventually gets himself caught with the biggest detectives of the United States. Tom Hanks plays the agent who chases him on the run knowing his true identity while the rest of the world thinks he's a thirty something thief.

I'd give it a 9 out of 10.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Mischievous movie,43718,silliemelie,8 December 2005,"I am a very mischievous person and I like to watch movies like that. Leonardo DeCaprio's character fools everyone. It's not all fun and games though, it has a really good plot with his family and the detective following him around. DeCaprio's character sort of reminded me of Johnny Depp's character on Pirates of the Caribbean. That is only because they both fool everyone to get what they want and it's funny to watch. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean I would recommend this movie. Tom Hanks did another excellent job as the detective. They pulled together a great cast. I was really able to get sucked into this movie. That's how I judged that this is a great movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"An intelligent, fast-paced, and thoroughly engaging odyssey",43718,davewrite,6 November 2005,"Forget morality. Most people want to see somebody beat the system -- no matter how he does it -- a winner! That why the movie-going world loves a con artist, especially if he's a young Adonis with a soft heart and a winning smile who exudes charm and cool sophistication. This sympathetically told true story shows how one teenager, skillfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio, did it with daring bravado.

The unlikely villain in this story is a kid who's traumatized by catching his mother cavorting with another man, which is soon followed by divorce. Unable to choose which parent should be his guardian, he runs away and applies both natural gifts and lessons learned from the playful deviousness of his skeptical father (who's just experienced financial ruin) to become America's most notable impostor, wangling serial employment as a cop, pilot, doctor, and lawyer. The skill acquired from learning how to forge a fake identity and bogus credentials give him the ability to forge checks -- filling suitcases with millions of dollars and a James Bond sort of life to go with it.

This film has many interesting contrasts. Pitting the plodding, joyless purposefulness of a rigidly moral FBI agent (Tom Hank's character) against the capricious cunning of a light hearted con gives a nice edge to this story. And the superb roles played by the best of the best character actors, Sheen Sr. and Christopher Walken (the father), add meaning and levity.

Steven Spielberg and his star-studded cast lived up to their billing with this one.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch this one if you can,43687,dmills7938,6 November 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. Spielberg did an excellent job of developing the characters and the casting of DiCaprio, Walken and Hanks in their respective roles brings this true story to life. You are tempted to feel pity for the father played by Walken but you realize that he is a malcontent who finds it difficult to take responsibility for his own actions. DiCaprio is perfect as the charming young con artist and complements Hanks character as the FBI agent as the plot moves from one twist to another. The plot provides a great mix of drama, tragedy, suspense, humor and fantasy. The soundtrack provides many well-placed tunes of that era including the sexy voice of Dusty Springfield singing ""The Look of Love"" which in my opinion should have won Oscar for best song in Casino Royale but lost to ""Talk to the Animals"" in Dr. Doolittle - go figure.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Very Entertaining,43687,gottogorunning,9 August 2005,"After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With 'Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.

Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.

The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.

Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Unseen Cruelty,43687,RARubin,27 June 2005,"Steven Spielberg has a style, a straight forward telling of a story. There is something middle class and suburban about his films. The temperament of the protagonists, their concerns is essentially middle-class whether the actors are soldiers of D Day or doomed Jews of Europe; their world, the well-to-do burgher world has crumbled. He doesn't write these scripts, but he certainly puts his stamp on them.

DiCaprio is very convincing, playing a teen, and then in turn, playing an older man whether doctor or pilot. I think that is a neat trick. I've always thought that actors are the weirdest of all artists and possibly the dumbest in real life, but I digress. Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con. The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle. His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life. DiCaprio is attracted to criminality, a ""Paper Hanger,"" living in the swinging late 60's with a suitcase full of ill-gotten cash. Tom Hanks, the stodgy FBI man is on his trail, but the boy is just too fast. He can only be caught if he wants to be caught. I digress again. Mr. Spielberg is not Alfred Hitchcock, but he learned a lot from watching Hitch's work. Keep the plot moving by the illusion of unseen cruelty, the shaking chandelier or invisible shark. Hitchcock fans know what I mean.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Charming film, with superb performance by Walken",43687,DarrenHorne,7 March 2005,"From 1963 to 1969 Frank Abignale Jr made the FBI ten most wanted list by performing awe inspiring confidence scams and stealing millions of dollars by forging cheques.

Catch me if you can tells the story of teenage Frank (Dicaprio), as he flees a broken home and sets off to gain enough money to rebuild his family. Frank sees the respect that certain professions command and manages to successfully pass himself off as a Pilot, Doctor and a Lawyer, (all, in part, to impress his father). He soon gains the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty, (Hanks) who hunts him for years and gradually develops a near fatherly fondness for him.

Dicaprio gives an outstanding performance that firmly establishes him as perhaps the finest actor of his generation. He perfectly blends a charismatic, cocky teenager with deep down fragility and emptiness that was caused by his parents split. The gut wrenching choose a parent scene strikes home to all of us how traumatic a parental divorce must be. The character development is spot on, from goofy teen to a worldly con man that can no longer distinguish between truth and fiction.

Hanks does well, playing a bookish FBI everyman with a touch of a sinister 1950s man in black. However Christopher Walken, as Frank's father, is superb and lifts the father son scenes from over sentimental Spielberg tosh, to highly charged and touching encounters. An award worthy performance that will have you blinking back the tears.

The delightfully nostalgic opening credits set the tone for this charming film that is genuinely heart-warming and fun. The trailer is misleading as this is not fast paced chase film, but a dark, character driven, true story that will have you hooked from the first few scenes. Dicaprio oozes charm, whilst at the same time showing a vulnerable, lonely side that will have you routing for him every step of the way. It is possibly 20 minutes too long, and it feels as though the last few scenes were tacked on at the end. However the end scene pulls the whole story together and gives the film a completeness that will have you smiling as you leave the cinema. An engaging and touching tale about a boys wish to be part of a family.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,An interesting chase movie,43718,manfungchau,23 February 2005,"When his parents separated and he had to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. ran away from home. He warned his money from cashing fabricated cheques, posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor. As the numbers went up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty started tracking him in a cat and mouse game. Based on a true story, I think this is a good film. The plot starts from the end and jumps back to see why and how Frank Abagnale Jr. was captured by Carl Hanratty. It is the reason why the two hours goes by very quickly. The presentation is good. The opening credits impressed me and attracted me to continue watching this film. I also enjoyed watching the exciting game of cat and mouse. The cast is good as all of them acted very well. I think DiCaprio is good, he acted well and he made a lot of expressions. Hanks has also done a good work. His character is quite dull but I really thought that he did better than DiCaprio. Both of them gave a fine performance. On the whole this film is an interesting chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story. This film was excited and interesting to let me staying on the seat for two hours.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,fun Spielberg entertainment,43656,TheNorthernMonkee,6 January 2005,"SPOILERS Each individual director has his own unique style. Whether including a specific type of shot, or links to past films, there is always something unique to directors. The same is true of legendary director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg's films always tend to have an almost childlike feel to them. Often feel good films, Spielberg will create a film which, irrelevant of subject matter, always has a colourful style of imagery and background. In ""Catch Me If You Can"", Spielberg repeats this style with a clever little film telling the story of Frank Abagnale Junior.

From the very beginning of the film, Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio) is shown to be a clever boy. Learning skills from his father (Christopher Walken), Abagnale slowly begins to learn how to copy cheques and over the next two years spends his time travelling from location to location, conning his way into different professions. All the time however, Frank is followed by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).

When Steven Spielberg directs a good film, the man directs a VERY good film. Able to create an almost cartoon like world, Spielberg manages to grip us from start to finish. Whilst the opposite is true and Spielberg can sometimes create the most appalling work, with films like ""Catch Me If You Can"", we can perhaps forgive his mistakes.

From the opening animation of the film, we know the basic premise. As Abagnale travels from place to place, there are moments of pure brilliance as this quick witted boy (since he's not even 17 when he begins the journey) outfoxes Hanratty time and time again.

The connection between Abagnale and Hanratty in particular is what makes this film. With two well developed characters, both DiCaprio and Hanks give brilliant performances as we begin to bond with both characters. Superbly assisted by Christopher Walken and a few other actors, the two stars thrive in this fun little film.

The beauty of ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the partnership of the main stars and the direction of Spielberg. Working brilliantly together, these three men and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, have examined Abagnale's story of his life and produced a great film which remains fun from start to finish. Great fun.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,When real life becomes fantasy...,43718,pyrocitor,31 December 2004,"Director Steven Spielberg returns to what he does best with this take on the true story of Frank Abegnale Jr, (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was convicted for dozens of cases of check fraud and assuming false identities before the age of 25. And a true story it may be, but all of Abegnale's daring deeds and frantic escapes are oversimplified in this telling - everything he does seems too easy and natural for him. Showing the difficulty the real Abegnale would have had to endure would add some realism and make the tale less of a fantasy escape, which is what it ultimately ends up as.

But for a fantasy escape, there is some real drama infused into the story, especially with the strange yet fascinating relationship between Abegnale Jr. and Sr, and Frank Jr. realizing that he can't just settle down to marry his girlfriend Brenda (Amy Adams) who knows him under a different identity, since he is being constantly hunted by the authorities. And near the end, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gradually warms to his query Abegnale, despite all the trials and frustrations he has been put through - an unexpected and much appreciated reversal of character.

DiCaprio does a good portrayal of Abegnale Jr. as he starts out confident and full of energy, while slowly descending into virtual paranoia, always looking over his shoulder and devising new ways to once again prevent capture. Tom Hanks also gives a strong performance as Carl Hanratty, the driven officer determined to catch Abegnale Jr. and bring him to justice. Yet they are both in danger of being overshadowed by notorious scene stealer Christopher Walken, in an Academy Award nominated performance, playing Abegnale Sr. the idol of his criminal son. Walken is truly affecting as he slowly comes to terms that he isn't as invincible as he thought, as his wife leaves him and everything he possesses is steadily taken by the government as he continually neglects to pay taxes. But his frequent self-confidence boosting sayings (""Two mice fell into a bucket of cream. One gave up and quickly drowned, but the second kept struggling and churned the cream into butter. Right now, I am that second mouse"") give his son (and perhaps himself as well) the impression that he's on top of his situation.

It's an excellent package, with John Williams' excellent 50's style score beautifully complementing Spielberg's work. It may be lighter and less realistic than it could have been, but Catch me if you Can is without a doubt, a lot of fun to watch, which is all it really needed to be.

CatchMeIfYouCan,DiCaprio does it again with Spielberg this time.,43718,vishal_wal,26 December 2004,"The movie is just brilliant and is one of best flick I've seen till date. Dicaprio is brilliant and Tom hanks is very good. The movie has all the elements of a good movie. A tight plot, socially responsible handling of an otherwise psyche-corruptible story, beautiful performances by abganale Sr. and Jr. and a tight direction by Spielberg. The movie doesn't go off track not even for a single second and ends at an appropriate point. The jock, which frustrated Tom Hanks narrates to his peers is just too much. Movie has Spielberg humor, Spielberg pace and Spielberg commitment. The scene in which Dicaprio takes off on an air plane and hanks watches the aero plane is a very difficult scene to direct but is shot so smoothly that it doesn't even attract the attention. The movie is just great. I would give 9 because only movies like Anand and Guide(Hindi) and My Cousin Vinny and The Truman Show (English) gets 10 on 10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent Movie!,43718,babiedol12,25 December 2004,"Catch Me If You Can is a very fine take on a true story. It brings together three of Hollywood's biggest names  Di Caprio, Hanks and Spielberg  in a collaboration that is certainly no pretender.

Frank Abagnale Jr. and Stan Redding, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage boy growing up in 1960s New York who ran away from home following his parent's divorce and made a living out of slyly and meticulously impersonating a doctor, a co-pilot for Pan Am airlines, and a lawyer. Hot on his trail but seemingly always one step behind is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows to admire and respect Frank's clear brilliance despite having only met him once. Told in elongated flashbacks as Frank is being escorted by Hanratty to an American prison, Frank had cashed more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks around the world and in all fifty states by the time he was caught at the age of 19.

As if Spielberg hasn't shown himself to be the foremost American cinematic storyteller yet, Catch Me If You Can solidifies his position. This is the kind of film that reminds you of the absolute enjoyment of watching a great story in the hands of a great director and cast working with a love for the cinema that radiates from off the screen. But let's get one thing straight: Spielberg doesn't automatically make great movies because he's a great director; he's a great director because he has the ability to make great movies. Catch Me If You Can is one of them.

Overall: 9.5/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,The best cat and mouse film I have ever seen,43718,OriginalMovieBuff21,9 October 2004,"Catch Me If You Can is the greates cat and mouse runaways I have ever seen. This movie being directed by my favorite director Steven Spielberg and my favorite actor Tom Hanks along with one of my favorite actors Leonardo DiCaprio si amazing. The acting, story, script, editing, and directing were just fabulous. I watched this all the time on HBO and even if there was other good films on I would watch this movie instead. What Frank Abagnale Jr. did while Carl Hanratty always chased him was amazing. He must be one of the most smartest guys ever. Overall, this film was great and I highly recommend it.

Hedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-

CatchMeIfYouCan,Cat & mouse situations maintain interest to the end,43687,raymond-15,30 August 2004,"I was fascinated by the very original introductory credits and some of the best graphics in years. It grabbed my immediate interest and augured well for what was to follow.

The film itself is based on a series of serious criminal offences perpetrated by a young man called Frank Abagnale. The eventual outcome of his years of crime is nothing short of miraculous...almost unbelievable were it not for the fact that the events actually happened.

The dramatic theme is handled with a very light touch...even with a sense of comedy at times. Leonardo Di Caprio excels as the anti-hero giving us quite an arresting performance. His role suggests that if you wish to impersonate someone the donning of a uniform ensures you are half way there.

It is interesting that Tom Hanks was happy to play a supporting role. Despite his capable interpretation of the CIA agent, it is Leonardo's part as the lying,cheating, fraudulent impostor that will be remembered.

To some extent some of the situations are repetitive and the film may be a trifle long, but I have to admit that there is a surge of interest in the end with an unpredictable aftermath of his life of crime.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Original and flawless.,43718,ducksr,28 August 2004,"Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, is an extremely entertaining film, and absolutely lovely to watch. DiCaprio plays the well-known fraud Frank Abagnale Jr., and Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent Hanratty who's chasing him, and they both deliver great performances, DiCaprio in particular. Being based on a true story, this movie develops into a roller coaster of fun, and one of the truly great films of 2002. Even though the movie may seem a little slow in the beginning, there's never a boring moment, and I have to say this is one of the most entertaining films I've ever come across. It swiftly made it's way into my top 10 movies, and I will watch it again and again.

An original and great movie, with flawless acting and direction. Definitively one of the most entertaining movies of all time, it never gets dull! 8/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Frank W. Abagnale, Jr.: The Great Pretender",43687,EmperorNortonII,24 July 2004,"""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the amazing story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., a clever con man who posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and forged over $4 million in checks in the process. The story was directed by Steven Spielberg, and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. Tom Hanks plays Agent Carl Hanratty, the tenacious F.B.I. agent who stayed on Abagnale's trail, in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. DiCaprio manages to bring charm to his role, while Hanks gives a straight-laced performance. And the opening credits, done in retro-style animation, makes for excellent eye candy. It's not quite the sort of thing you'd expect from Spielberg, but it's definitely worth watching!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Captures the Imagination,43748,mattryan00,25 December 2002,"This was definitely a fun one. I saw this one Christmas day with the family and was very much impressed. It's fun to see Hanks as a flawed character, and his performance (along with Leo's) was just awesome.

There were some laughs to go along with the drama, but most of all, Frank's (Leo) actions served to capture the imagination. His many ""Zach Morris moments"" make this film a real treat to watch. I don't say this often, but this film is probably worth your $6-10---depending on how much your local theater gouges you. I gave it a 10 ;o)

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of the best movie of the year,43748,mchl_dao,25 December 2002,"BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR

LEONARDO AND TOM HANKS RULED

STEVEN SPEILBERG ONCE AGAIN DELIVERED HIS GREAT MOVIE INTO MOTION PICTURE

THE BEST WAY TO ENJOY YOUR HOLLIDAY IS GO SEE THIS MOVIE

I GIVE THIS MOVIE 10/10

BUT...

One thing that I don't like in this movie is the appearance of Jennifer Garner is too short, I mean I really like her and Steven Speilberg need to give her a good plot in this movie instead of just a....hooker. I still like this movie anyway,",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Neither true thriller nor credible comedy, but boasts an entertaining story",43656,rodmans545,15 April 2003,"Steven Spielberg's latest film is the true story of the prodigious teenage con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo Di Caprio) who manages during the late 1960's to forge over two million dollars in checks throughout several different countries while posing as an airline pilot, a pediatrician, an attorney, and a college professor. All the while, he is being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), whose dedication to catching Abagnale borders on obsessive.

While the main focus of the film is on Abagnale's genius for defrauding the government, deceiving just about anyone with whom he comes into contact, and the ensuing cat and mouse game with the FBI, it also allows us a glimpse into the underlying roots of his deception. His father Frank Abagnale Sr., portrayed with great depth and sincerity by Christopher Walken, has a penchant for deceit himself but when his business and marriage fall apart it ignites his son's strong yearning to restore the life and family they once had and ultimately his ambitious yet perilous journey into high stakes fraud.

There are times when the plot seems repetitious and predictable, and therefore robs this film of becoming a first rate thrill ride. But strong performances, a fascinating storyline with both comical and sad undertones, and a fulfilling ending make Catch Me If You Can worth the trip to the cinema.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"God Save us from the ""Spielberg"" touch",43475,doublechump,10 January 2003,"I lasted about ten minutes in this ""gem"" before running from the theatre in disgust. I'm so sick of movies that tell you every moment how you should ""feel"". Spielberg doesn't trust his audience to make their own decisions about what they are watching. Each and every single second is so manufactured that it is impossible to react in any other way than in the micromanaged specific predigested fashion in which Mr. Spielberg wants us to. Perhaps his movies are meant to be watched with the sound off. They are like panels of a cartoon. The visuals are clear and they certainly tell a story in a clear and distinct way, but there's no room to breathe, no air on the screen. It's like being at a Natural History museum looking at stuffed cavemen hunting a sabre tooth tiger. Sure is pretty. But nobody's breathing up there.

Since I only saw ten minutes (which is enough for me if a movie is as terrible as this one. The film could've turned into ""citizen Kane"" the moment I left and it wouldn't matter, the damage had been done) I can only comment on what I saw, so here goes:

The title sequence:

I hated those faux-sixties cartoon drawings. Like everything in Spielberg's post-""Close Encounters"" body of work, it doesn't quite make it. It was a cute idea, but instead of getting an artist who would really do a good job stealing from the Saul Bass school of design, he got somebody who fumbled the job, making it seem more like the cheapo animation in one of those 70's health movies like ""I am Joe's Stomach"" or something. Even worse is John Williams score, but the less said about him the better.

The ""To Tell the Truth"" opening was one of the laziest first draft attempts at expopsition I'd seen since the Ndugu letters of ""About Schmidt"". Doesn't anybody know who to write dialogue anymore? Plus, the transition from the gameshow to the rainy sequence in France was both clumsy and non sensical. Once again, Speilberg gets a case of the nauseating ""cutes"". Gee, French people are funny, they can't pronounce this character's name. Gee, does everybody in the audience get that THIS is the guy that Leonardo De Caprio was talking about in the previous frame? That fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks? By this point I had one foot aimed towards the exit.

Then we get another ""cutesy poo"" Spielberg moment when the fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks has to open an umbrella inside because there's a leak. Sacre Bleu! That's Hi-larious!

Then we get another in a long list of what I like to call the ""Pinnochio meets Faces of Death"" moments that Spielberg seems so fond of. Where broad bad comedy meets the harrowing and gut-wrenching. Like in Amistad where first we get Matthew McCaughnahay doing his best High School Acting version of ""Mr Toad's Wild Ride"" and then we get African American slaves chained together and thrown into the sea. This is where Leo's consumptive hacking (which is better suited to ""Midnight Express"" than this lightweight ersatz caper/chase flick) is juxtaposed with the worst accent I think I've ever heard in a movie (even worse than Leo's irish? accent in the Gangs of New York). The fat guy who looks like he ate Tom Hanks is nattering on under that umbrella, the faceless French guys are chimpering in inaudible francois and Leo is hacking up like John Hurt in Aliens. What's wrong with this picture? Why is Speilberd so determined to gross us out? (See ""Minority Report"" with its hacking of snot and rancid-food-eating scene for his most recent offense)

Then we get Leo's attempted escape which of course is accompanied by the entire prison population shrieking and urging him on like the Forum crowd in ""Ben Hur"".

When Christopher Walken arrives, he managed to use his own quirky acting rhythms to throw a pleasant monkey wrench into Spielberg's well oiled McMovie. But by the time Leo was watching his parents dancing the wine stain into the white rug, and then when Walken told Leo not to hit the curb while parking (guess what he does anyway!? Screams of knee-jerk laughter from the multi-plex crowd)I had seen enough. I want to have my own feelings, Mr. Speilberg, thank you. I have only to refer to ""Far From Heaven"" as an example of how to let an audience think. Even though the movie had an arch tone and over-the-top dialogue at times and looked like a techinicolor fantasy, it never told you how to feel. It allowed you to make your own decisions. But I'm afraid Mr. Spielberg has morphed past the point where he'll have anything meaningful to say to someone past an eighth grade education.

Yuck. Ten minutes was tooooooo much.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg does Soderberg...,43534,ldavis-2,28 December 2002,"and the results are deadly: a technically flawless but self-righteous, humorless film maker, he is utterly incapable of embracing the joy of this cat-and-mouse chase, much less, appreciating the delicious irony of Abagnale's post-conviction life. Ironically, the usually-bombastic (and equally self-righteous) John Williams manages to reign himself in; his score was such a surprise, I though someone else had done it.

Although DiCaprio tries mightily, Abagnale remains a selfish punk not worthy of our sympathy. He lets his father, for whom he launches his crime spree, drown in debt while he makes off with suitcases stuffed with cash. That Sr. has no problem claiming to be a Medal of Honor winner in a pathetic attempt to secure a loan tells us he wasn't above accepting ""help"" from Jr.

Which leads us to Hanratty, who is not only self-righteous and humorless, but mean. He takes a perverse joy in telling Jr. what happened to Sr. And he wonders why Jr. escapes from the plane!

The ER scene should have been written thusly: Jr. storms in like a general, talks to Mom while examining/comforting the boy, respectfully asks the interns for their diagnosis, forces himself to soak up the blood from the wound (which we get a gratuitous close-up of) while trying desperately not to pass out! That would not only have been funny, it would have displayed Abagnale's moxie and pluck. Instead, I found myself hoping he'd rot in jail.

When Jr. is given a bogus check by the FBI agents, he notes that the paper is not perforated. Since we never learn how he mastered making bogus checks or obtained the tools needed, we must assume that he wasn't working with paper that wasn't perforated, either! How this minor detail got past the ""experts"" at the FBI (and Spielberg) is not for us lesser minds to ponder.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,A very interesting and entertaining film...,43687,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,3 October 2003,"This is an interesting story, watching a con artist evolve, how he starts off with the small stuff(in an early scene, he pretends that he's a substitute teacher, to get back at another student)to stealing enormous amounts of money(several million dollars). To watch how intelligently he tricks people, into getting information he needs for his next scam, how he professionally forges checks and the likes. A very good movie, enjoyable to the common viewer.

CatchMeIfYouCan,How to get a job with the FBI,43656,#ERROR!,7 May 2003,"""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the story of Frank Abagnale, con man. With Spielberg in the director's chair and A-listers leading the way, you'd expect something a little better than this story about a kid who conned his way into jobs as a Pan Am pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, and into some serious money. Reasonably entertaining and well crafted, this film runs a tad long and is smeared with comedic overtones making it difficult to take seriously. It might have worked better as a serious rather than playful drama. Nonetheless, worth a look by anyone interested in stories about scamming. (B)

Note - If you like this flick, you might want to check out Tony Curtis in ""The Great Imposter"" (1961)

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Watch it, if you can stand it.",43475,telfer-rachel,16 January 2003,"Catch Me If You Can' is inspired by the memoirs of Frank Abagnale Jnr so it is suprising that Spielberg shows no interest in Franks' character or the amazing feats/cons he accomplished. Instead of a movie about a remarkable young man we have one about motivation for criminal actions stemming from a broken home and a dishonest father and the particularly unremarkable FBI agent trying to catch him.

There is little description of how he charmed his way through cons as most of the movie is spent giving a completely false impression of his father(and hence him)or showing the plodding Hanratty one step behind him again.

The characters are simplistic, one dimensional and worse dull. In one scene as Hanratty is reporting to his boss his assistant agents loitering at the back of the office are licking ice-creams, they're dopey and outsmarted by Abagnale, WE GET IT ALREADY!

I would like to be able to say I was disillusioned having read Abagnales' book before watching the movie, but I can't. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Lots of old pros telling an amazing story - yet plays like a TV movie!,43626,Pedro_H,2 November 2004,"A young man with a sharp brain and the face of someone much older takes the fast track to riches by way of wholesale cheque fraud.

I know of only one or two scripts that have been going the rounds longer before being actually made. Caligula - the troubled Roman epic - is probably the one you have heard of.

You can see why the original book (which shares the movie title) was hot-to-trot. The studio execs must have viewed it as a sure-fire winner that no one could really go wrong with. The only problem being the lack of talent waiting to take on this fish-in-a-barrel project. Maybe some projects are a little too obvious - Cleopatra anyone?

Spielberg didn't really want to direct this one and through politics to complicated to go in to here had to switch from producer to director. His heart is not in it - so he just goes for the plod-plod-plod movie-by-numbers approach. Sad to see him not really extending his wonderful cineast brain.

I read up heavily on the true life case of Frank Abigale Jnr and even read the press library interviews that he made after seeing the film. His escape from a plane showed that he was a true life James Bond! I always say: Knowledge is power!

While the script was true in all its main facts it exaggerates the state of the French prison - that while tough it was not as tough as this. Although it was no holiday camp either. It also skims over how he got to practise law - the reason given here is a classic of stating selective truths.

(He flunked the exam several times and was allowed to view his mistakes. There may have been bribery involved as well.)

Tom Hanks and DiCaprio play off each other well, but they don't really have a lot to do with each other. The phone calls are a fabrication. They are really working in their own little bubble that only collide every now and then.

What is the moral here? That if you say your name is Joe Blow and you are an airline pilot people believe you. That if you put as much effort in to crime as you do in to a real job it can pay better? Life has moved on since those days. CCTV, computers, the Internet, you wouldn't last five minutes doing all this today.

The saddest thing is that despite his wealth Frank never looks happy. Not here anyway.Money doesn't make you happy seems the closing moral - but a look around the set of this film would quickly show that to be a lie.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,CRAP ME IF YOU CAN,43475,pstonej,19 January 2003,"Leonardo Dicaprio unfortunately marred and tainted his career for life by choosing to do titanic. If I had the chance to make multi-millions and be an international sex star I probably would sell out too. His performance in this along with the rest of his films is superb. Unfortanetly Tom Hanks does exactly what he always does, act poorly. He always plays tom hanks playing someone else, he's not playing the FBI agent, he's playing tom hanks as the FBI agent. Tom Hanks AS Tom Hanks AS some character. Once again, Spielberg also is merely mediocre. He has no edge nor directorial creativity and hardly does anything but tell an interesting story in a very bland way. The best part of the movie was the opening credits which was a throwback to the classic graphics of the opening credits of the 1950 (eg. anatomy of a murder) Walken plays his role quite well though. Overall, the movie was pretty mediocre but DiCaprio and Walken make it enternaining enough for for me to have stayed awake amidst the tired work of spielberg and hanks.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Is it over yet?,43506,spatookbien,21 April 2004,"This film is one of the most boring i have ever seen. The plot is established very quickly, then we are given around 2 hours of Di Caprio pulling off the most ridiculous, barely believable feats of money making while Hanks, who's character is given little background and no depth, stays one step behind. The ending is dragged out ridiculously, and gives little satisfaction.

The real problem i found was that Di Caprio is on-screen almost all the time, yet he spends so much time pretending to be someone else, we never get to know his character and therefore i found it impossible to feel any emotion to his situation.

After 1 hour, the film wears thin, after another hour, i was barely awake. Its films like this that make me wonder why Spielberg is still popular. Schindlers List came out 10 years ago, and since then he has not made one good film.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Fun in sadness,43748,forrest44,16 April 2006,"Aside from Schindler's List, Catch Me If You Can is my favourite Steven Spielberg film, in which I believe something common between us teenagers is reflected home-- fear to see our parents' divorce. Frank's life as an economic criminal began right after his parents' announcing divorce. He first did this just for living, and then the thought of reunion his family took over. Like many teenagers, Frank loves his parents so much, as can be told through the minutia that Frank wants his mother to quit smoking, but they, just like many parents, just seem to ignore this, as an only child, I can't help but feeling extremely sad about it. Each pair of parents should pay attention to this brilliant piece of work, 'cause sometimes you just have no idea about how your children love you! Frank made every effort trying to reunion his parents, but each time his father turned him down. Every crazy step Frank took was related to this purest wish, nothing seems matters when compared with it, even going to jail. His father's death made up his mind to visit his beloved mother, who was happy with her new family, Frank alone outside in Christmas, urging Carl to put him in the car not to be seen by mom, not to worry her. I just can't help laughing and crying each time I saw this movie. Steven Spielberg is amazing! He handle the delicate feeling of the many Franks and the carelessness of parents so very well and accurately. A tragic rather than a comedy. A triumph deserves recommended.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,The Best Movie EVER,43748,sportzaholic7,11 April 2006,"If you have not seen this movie yet, go rent it this minute!!! Actually it deserves all the money you can give it! I loved it so much, it is by far my very favorite movie of all time. it combines mystery with a tragic story so well, and of course the comedy that comes with this match up of Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. Both play their roles magnificently with an aura about them that seems Oscar worthy. if two cowboys deserve them, then tom and Leo deserve 10. they are absolutely brilliant. I never thought that a sad story could be so well written and keep me on my toes for two hours of pure movie magic. And at the end i was amazed at how well these events were conveyed because this really did happen. I thought that was amazing. BUY IT!!! Give it to your friends for Christmas, thanksgiving and Easter.

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of the best movies ever!,43748,Pookyiscute,3 December 2005,"I saw this movie twice in the theater, which is saying a lot, because I hardly ever even go to the theater to begin with. To say that Stephen Spielberg is a genius is an understatement, when it comes to films like this. Every single moment in the movie is captured with sheer brilliance and fantastic execution. He knows exactly how to make the audience feel with each and every different aspect that is delivered to us in each and every scene.

Leonardo DiCaprio is of course famous for Titanic, and other films since then, but I would have to say that this is his best role to date, since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". Although he is a character actor, and a good one at that, this role for him was perfect, because he not only was given the chance to be a ""character"" but also the lead in the film. He is able to carry a whole movie on his shoulders with such ease it is so enjoyable to watch.

Tom Hanks was certainly not one to forget in this film, either, though. His character, Handratty, was unforgettable as well. Hanks is able to make you hate him, feel sorry for him, and laugh at him all at once in 'Catch Me'. His accent is very well rehearsed, and there are times you forget that it is Tom Hanks, and not the real character he is playing.

This movie will leave you cheering for the wrong team, and holding your breath at times. It is hard not to like this film, and I give it a full 10 for it's magic, beauty and true-to life story that it so gracefully delivers to us. A good watch and great film in general.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,it did make money over its time... entertaining,43718,Quinoa1984,25 December 2002,"...but did Steven Spielberg's latest Blockbuster-fodder, Catch Me If You Can, have to be released now? The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks have already turned in their best for the year (Gangs of New York and Road to Perdition, respectively), even if those performances weren't great, and Spielberg's other chase film released during the summer, Minority Report, was one of his best films. While the release date shouldn't directly effect the film itself, it might've given Scorsese's Gangs a little chance to breath without having this and that as two Leo films at once during the Christmas-break film rush.

Catch..is inspired by the story of Frank W. Abignale Jr., who as a teen became a con-man, impersonating an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc, and was finally caught in France. DiCaprio plays Frank, and tries to play him as a suave, if occasionally panicked, teen, and while there have been worse performances this year, it is very clear that the better work for him is in Gangs, not here- he's often too straightforward with his emotions and only hints to that he's someone outside of a conniver. Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job, with a keen accent and demeanor, and Christopher Walken, who plays Abignale Sr., turns in the best performance of the film, and shows more depth than his son in the few scenes he has.

Overall, there are some moments of fun that shine through, like when Frank Jr. does his first con as a school teacher at 16, or when he fools Hanks at the Miami airport, yet it can be seen in many scenes that more challenging material was manipulated by Spielberg and company. Still, it should appeal to the mass market of movie-goers.

....this is a re-edit some four years later. On repeat viewings, the film works better. DiCaprio actually works as more effective with his character, and even Hanks becomes more interesting than just 'decent'. B+",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Bravo Bravo,43748,agvsss,10 October 2019,"A masterpiece. I haven't read the book but now I will, from the things that I saw from Spielberg this is definitely one of the best ones.

DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken are perfect in this movie. I had a lot of fun I will re-watch it again of course!

I recommend it to everyone, amazing movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Signature Spielberg direction,43687,calspers,2 October 2019,"""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) directed by Steven Spielberg I thought was a great cat-chasing-mouse film.

From the opening credits, the film eers with stylistic homogeneity. The excellent writing by Jeff Nathanson, the smooth directional choices by Spielberg, the brilliant score by John Williams, the great cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, although a shame it was shot in 16:9. It all contributes to making this a greatly entertaining film achievement.

The most impressive though, to me was the performances by leading Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and by supporting Christopher Walken and especially by Amy Adams and Martin Sheen.

One thing I thought a weakness was that is didn't feel timeless - somehow it felt stuck in the beginning of the 00's in its production style.

Overall, though, a fine film by Spielberg.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Really Good,43656,michaeltrivedi,2 October 2019,"This is what great filmmaking is all about. Put Spielberg together with Leo, and you have undoubtedly great chemistry.

The film centers upon a young man, who runs away from home after his parents' divorce. To survive, he begs, borrows, and steals, but mainly steals. Through different identities and various schemes, he's able to make millions and millions of dollars on people's and corporations' stupidity.

It's a really great con film, and has a bit on noir mixed into it. Tom Hanks is interesting to watch as well.

7 Stars

Tom Hanks and Walken provide solid performances also that keep the film riveting. The first half is stellar. The second half could have been shorter but overall the film ends on a good note. Fantastic film

CatchMeIfYouCan,A great story,43718,kltfalcon,28 September 2019,"I mark it as want to watch a long time ago. But in this time, I just have time to watch it. The movie tells a great story. Frank W. Abignale, Jr who is just a kid as main actress in this movie. After his father and mother get a divorce, he starts pretending to be a copilot, a doctor, a lawyer. He make 4 millions dollar by fake check. He is very talented. When Tom Hanks who is after him find him for the first time in a motel, he capable to fool Hanks. He is so calm in that situation. But beside that, he is so lonely, he call Hanks every Christmas to has someone talk to him. The ending is also great. Leonardo DiCario who plays Frank W. Abignale, Jr is perfect. I really love his acting. I will watch it again.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Easily my favorite Spielberg / Hanks Collab,43718,matthewssilverhammer,26 September 2019,"This is easily my favorite Hanks / Spielberg collaboration, & maybe the funniest film in Spielberg's history. A wonderfully written Christmas movie that perfectly encapsulates the disillusionment of material wealth in lieu of loving, familial connection. It's a more empathetic version of Spielberg's usual father-issues motif, though the child still struggles with his father's selfishly poor decisions. DiCaprio & Hanks are super good, but my MVP is Walken, turning in a performance as sad as it is charismatic.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A true story that is fun and entertaining!,43748,archer191273,16 September 2019,"This is the story of Frank Abagnale. A con artist, forger and imposter who from the age of 15 to 21 millions while eluding the FBI. He posed as a pilot, physician and even had a go at a US bureau of prisons agent. This is by far 1 of my favourite stories with the most unlikely of outcomes for such a grand thief. Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are both as usual great in this film. A must see movie that shows how unlikely and un predictable life can really be. Very entertaining!!

CatchMeIfYouCan,"An unbelievable film, yet based on a true story",43656,SimonJack,11 August 2019,"As unbelievable as it seems to be, ""Catch Me If You Can"" was based on a real person and his exploits. That included, by the time he was just 19 years of age, passing himself off as a major airline passenger jet pilot, a medical doctor, a lawyer, and a prison official. Frank Abagnale Jr. told his story in a book co-written by Stan Redding in 1980, by the same title as this film.

Of course, in order to get away with any of his imposter roles, Abagnale had to look older than he was. And, the tricks and traits he developed for conning banks, businesses and people took imagination and some skill to learn. His story is a fascinating one and ideal for a very entertaining film. As the movie shows, Abagnale eventually was caught and spent time in jail. In reality, he served short sentences in France and Sweden before being extradited to the U.S. And, as the film notes at the end, he eventually turned his experience into a lucrative career and later business. He helped the FBI, banks and businesses to spot and protect against fraud.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale in this film, and Tom hanks plays Carl Hanratty. His role is based on the real FBI agent who was the chief pursuer of the cagey con man. That was Joseph Shea, who later was a close friend of Abagnale's until Shea's death.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,A Great Story And Two Iconic Actors Lead To A Classic Film.,43687,J_Batek_II,12 July 2019,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. The fact the Leonardo DiCaprio won an Academy Award for 'The Revenant' in 2015 but wasn't even nominated for this film is ridiculous. Frank Abagnale has a fascinating story and Leonardo DiCaprio played the role perfectly. Tom Hanks was a good stiff cop and the soundtrack is great. This film is currently one of IMDB's Top 250, and unlike about half of those films, this one actually belongs on that list. Kudos to Spielberg and his boyfriend Tom for another great collaboration.

CatchMeIfYouCan,An amusing comedy based on the real story,43687,zutterjp48,12 July 2019,"I enjoyed very much this film because we make at the same time a serious travel in the world of the swindle and the forgery but also a funny travel in the life of of all the tricks Frank Abagnale finds to avoid the police and begin a new life for example.Frank Abagnale Jr was really a very skillfull forger and impersonator (a Pan Am pilot,a doctor, a legal prosecutor).Then we have the story of Carl Hanratty, a FBI bank fraud agent who tries to catch the very clever and astute Frank. The performances of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom hans and Christopher Walken are very good.As the film is based on a real story we know at the end what happened in the real life with two main characters.

CatchMeIfYouCan,highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities,43687,kikoydaba3,7 July 2019,"Catch Me If You Can is a highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities. Director Steven Spielberg gorgeously delivers a film set in the 60s following the exploits of Frank William Abagnale Jr. as a con man, effortlessly played by Leonardo DiCaprio.

The film tackles themes of family, parenthood and loss. Frank Jr. starts with a happy family that quickly fractures when financial struggles and extra-marital affairs led to his parent's divorce played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank Sr. and Paula Abagnale, respectively. Their divorce precipitated his descent to financial crimes. Hot on the trail is Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, an FBI bank fraud agent. Carried by a great cast and brisk editing, Catch Me If You Can never slows and the audience is completely immersed in the journey and thrill of Frank Jr.'s exploits. Every shot looks beautiful with the impressive cinematography from recurring Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski. Composer Michael Khan provides a score that reflects the tone of the film.

Ultimately, Catch Me If You Can fails to reach its true potential because the character growth of Frank Jr. has little weight. Through the course of the film, moments are sprinkled to reveal Frank Jr.'s motivations but this is not fully explored. The script comes short in realizing that Frank Jr.'s broken family is the reason for his actions. The emotional weight of the film gets lost in the chase aspect. However, the film remains a marvel to appreciate considering all its qualities.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Te opening scene was built by cute motion graphics!,43656,Aoi_kdr,29 June 2019,"Ah, maybe I cry when I will just see Tom Hanks next time. This movie was based on the true episode of them, a defrauder, Frank Abagnale. But thd most important facter was the detective tried to chatch him. He was Mr.Hanratty.

Although they had a hostile relation like a target who was chased and chasing, they got friendships finally. I realized that the criminal also is hurt by himself. Maybe it's possible to prevent some crimes by someone's love. I hope it will be in our society.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Outstanding, amazing and more thrilling.",43748,yasir619,22 June 2019,"This is one of the best and most underrated movie of leonardo dicaprio's. Outstanding performance by leo and tom hanks. Movie has such a great suspense and dramatic emotions. What can i say more about that how excellent he is at pretending in this movie by fooling all the people no matter wherever he goes. Being pilot, a doctor and lawyer and then a F.B.I agent. I just loved it when a thought came into my mind that whole F.B.I was chasing him and wanted him to down but in the end he is working for the F.B.I how cool is that, huh? The acting of Tom hanks is no doubt he is a outstanding actor. Leo's acting is what make me humble every time. Man, what i brilliant actor he is. I had watched this movie back in 2015 when i was in school and i also loved it at that time so much but right now watch it again, it really felt so good, i usually like to watch each movie of leo over and over again because i love his acting, they way he talk, act and the way he performs.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Entertaining cat and mouse antics,43656,jimbo-53-186511,25 May 2019,"With just $25 dollars to his name, Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Di Caprio) does the seemingly impossible and manages to pose as a doctor, lawyer and a pilot all with no formal training all the while whilst defrauding banks across the USA out of millions of dollars. However, hot on his heels is moody FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) who doggedly pursues Abagnale in order to bring him to justice...

Based on Frank Abagnale Jr's own book, Spielberg delivers Catch Me If You Can with a mostly light-hearted playful feel (which given the source material was arguably the best way to pitch it). Di Caprio does a wonderful job in bringing Abagnale Jr to life (he's charming and charismatic but with a sympathetic edge - he's trying to help his family which never renders him unlikeable at any point). Hanks has a trickier job in his role as a rather dry FBI Agent, but at times this is used to good effect when his attempts at being funny hit a brick wall. Amy Adams is the real surprise here as the dim-witted love interest to Abagnale and even a cynic like me felt some sympathy towards her later in the film.

As I've already mentioned, the light-hearted and playful tone is the film's biggest asset and this is what ensures that the film remains entertaining and enjoyable. Abagnale's elaborate ploys and Houdini like escapology are certainly imaginative and for me the film rarely misses a beat (despite its generous 120+ minute running time).

Given the fact that the real Frank Abagnale co-wrote the script and Spielberg directed the film I did wonder if the film may have been slightly embellished in the name of entertainment i.e were the FBI really that incompetent and did Abagnale really manage to impersonate pilots, doctors and lawyers with such ease? To be honest when the film ended, I didn't really care and the aforementioned points are more observations than criticisms.

At the end of the day the film was fun and to me that was what ultimately mattered.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Twists and turns,43656,paige-93915,15 May 2019,"During the move some positive things had approached while Frank has ran away. He was able to live on his own by making the fake checks that looked very real that he was able to actually cash them in. While he was on the run he was able to find himself a women he was going to marry while he was pretending the be a doctor. The way he could study a crowd and blend in to a crowd that acted simpler was astonishing and he wasn't cough by the police by doing so. some negative things had happened to him in this film one of the most i would think is the entire reason he had ran away all because his parents got a divorce so he ran away at 16 and continued pretending to be someone he wasn't some of the most important characters would probably be Frank Abagnale Jr, Carl Hanratty, and Franks father Frank Abagnale. At the age of 16-18 while he ran away he had pretended to be a lawyer, a doctor, and a co pilot for a famous airline and he had accomplished all of this without being cough.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch me if you can blew my mind!!! Kaitlyn B,43718,kaitlynb-88232,15 May 2019,"This movie was very well laid out, the director picked the perfect times to insert flashbacks/flash forwards. Also they picked the perfect cast for this, who better than Tom Hanks and Leonardo Decaprio. The movie was well laid out and spent a good amount of time on the important things. There were very few downsides to this movie. The only one that I can think of is they didn't really go into enough detail when the father passed away. I was really satisfied with the two main actors in this movie, Leonardo Dicaprio portrayed Frank Abignale really well. Tom Hanks was really well suited for the FBI agent as well. Over all the plot and the story line to the movie was very well thought out!",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can: 7.8,43656,jcruz-42957,28 April 2019,"For a two hour and twenty minute movie, Catch Me If You Can is surprisingly brisk. Smooth is the word that best describes this clever cat and mouse movie, smooth because of the consistent pace driven by excellently written and performed characters. Watching Frank Abagnale's antics throughout the story is so enjoyable to watch mostly to due DiCaprio's great performance and the rest of the cast, seen through Spielberg's signature dynamic camera. But the only things holding Catch Me If You Can back from being a great movie, is the shallowness of its stakes, and the jazz that is present sproadically through the movie but it needed to be present consistantly. Overall, Catch Me If You Can has fun antics by its eccentric characters, but is held back by the lack of jazz in its smooth step. So I give it a 7.8.

If you look up the real story, you realize that there are few similarities past the main character's name and a very basic description of what he did. The filmmakers took countless liberties.

But they did it in order to make a fun movie. It's nothing groundbreaking. It's not great art. But it's good fun for the entire duration. The actors did a great job. Recommend.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Amazing movie!,43748,isaactopal,2 April 2019,"This is one is my best movie I have ever seen. It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10.

I loved the main character Frank's attitude and his brilliant way of thinking. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better. I had to Google Frank Abagnale Jr. after watching this and the friendly face that smiled on the pictures wasn't really what I expected. Leo plays the roll very well. I'm also thinking that Leo and Tom Hanks must have had a lot of fun filming this.

I have definitely watched Catch Me If You Can more than ten times and i can watch it over and over again! Loved it! <3

CatchMeIfYouCan,"""I blew it, didn't I? Why didn't I concur?""",43656,gufi-04429,23 March 2019,"Great humor, great cinematography, great actors. It's an interesting story that is told in a very entertaining way. And even though it has an original plot and it's inspired by real events, the movie is still somehow not the best. It's okay, it has very good things in it but it was too long (and that's why boring at times) and even though DiCaprio is a great actor he looked too young for this specific role. I mean, it sounds pretty odd that Frank got away with all of his felonies for such a long time but it's even more unbelievable when we see Leo on the screen. In real life, the real Frank looked much older and that's why people believed he's 28. But still, great performance by DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Not the most outstanding movie though but it's good for a watch or two.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Funny portait of a con artist (Leonardo di Caprio), who is being pursued by detective Tom Hanks. Will Di Caprio pull of the perfect con and stay free from persecution?",43656,imseeg,21 February 2019,"The bad: this movie does last about an half hour too long to be really captivating till the very end. Because when all the con tricks have been played out, the magic of this upbeat con story has somewhat faded. At 2 hours and 15 minutes this movie overstretches it's attention span.

The good: cheery, upbeat story about a boy who wants to be succesful and figures out a conning way to do so, when he knows that the honest way to achieve succes is out of his league, because of poverty problems. By simply impersonating pilots, doctors and lawyers this boy succeeds in achieving the succes he always dreamt of. It is a very alluring story about tricking your way into succes and the constant chase between Di Caprio and Tom Hanks makes for a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. Really enjoyable watch for young and old, with a romantic interlude with the very young Amy Adams.

Biographical end note: director Steven Spielberg parents got divorced, when he was a kid. Many of the themes in Spielberg's films are about single parents and this movie is no exception. It is striking to see that this movies plot is also about a boy, who sees his parents struggle with financial problems and end up in a divorce. The boy copies his father's behaviour to solve his financial difficulties, by trying to con his way out of debt, in order to bring home the bacon. The father fails at his con jobs, whereas the son, played by Leonardo di Caprio, succeeds in conning his way into succes... Quite charming.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A must see film by Steven Spielberg,43748,lianagasparyan-49810,19 February 2019,"Catch Me If You Can is a stylish, confident comedy filled with adventure and originality. Here we see the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. - the brilliant conman who practiced medicine without attending medical school, passed as a pilot without attending flight school, and practiced law with absolutely no law degree. This was all accomplished before the age of 19, might I add. Like most Spielberg characters, Frank comes from a broken home. Frank thought he was living the good life with his loving father, Frank and mother, Paula, until his father started having financial problems. His family was forced to sell their house, their car and Frank saw his parent's marriage begin to crumble along with their lives. One day Frank is pulled out of school and told by a judge that his parents are getting divorced and Frank has to choose who he wants to live with. Traumatized by the news and circumstances, Frank Jr. hits the road and devises clever schemes to make it on his own. During his brilliant three-year run as a master of deception he cashes fake checks and amasses millions buying sports cars, fancy suits, and pretending to be a kind of James Bond with women. The con enables him to go undetected for awhile but soon the FBI gets wise to the bank forgeries and sends agent Carl Hanratty whop specializes in the bank fraud division, after Frank. Frank's ""good life"" includes dating various women who inspire him to try different careers. With each year that passes and with the large amount of forged checks that near $4 million. Catch Me If You Can is a high quality, entertaining film from the master of cinema, Steven Spielberg. This is one of those movies that is so fascinating and clever to watch, you can't believe it's based on a man's real-life memoirs. It's a fascinating study of a brilliant mind who didn't plan to be on the FBI's most wanted list. I particularly enjoyed the ensemble of talented actors, especially the wonderful chemistry between Hanks and DiCaprio. The acting, as expected, is top notch. Tom Hanks, in a supporting role, is at his usual level, which is nearly benchmark. He brings incredible depth to a character. Leonardo DiCaprio, who does not even pretend to share the stage with Hanks, is superb. This film is utterly entertaining and captivating, with very few slow parts and many funny moments. It has comedy, drama, suspense, romance - it covers every genre except for those looking for a shoot'em up action movie. I highly recommend to watch this movie!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,No one can keep their eyes off those damn pinstripes,43748,krivzha,19 February 2019,"How can that be real? The question covers not only the real story of Frank Abagnale Jr., but also the film itself. Steven Spielberg, Jeff Nathanson, John Williams, and the whole cast caught me from the very beginning of the film. Not unnaturally, that all the scams of real Frank Abagnale Jr. were romanticized, to say nothing of his relations with other characters, though, the historical inaccuracy is not that huge, and the film itself manages to knock a viewer off their pins. The list of worth-watching biopics is simply too short and Catch me if you can, with no doubt, ranks if not the first but at least the second in this list. Here is a young man, who escaping his parents' divorce flung himself whole-heartedly into check forgery and impersonating other people. Steven Spielberg uses all his filmmaking experience to present the story of this young man in a way that after end of the film a viewer starts to scrutinize the Internet to know more about the real Frank Abagnale Jr., and to know more details about his life. The same manages to achieve the main actor Leonardo DiCaprio, and it is worth mentioning that Leonardo DiCaprio playing a role of impersonator impersonated not only a pilot, doctor and parish prosecutor, but Frank Abagnale Jr. himself. Obviously, a great criminal story can't be without a great detective. In this case we have Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks who as usual presented high quality acting. And on the whole the music composed by John Williams adds a spice to this masterpiece of Steven Spielberg. From the very beginning of the film John Williams manages to deliver the main features of the film: intrigue, lightheartedness and intensity of narration. The film is fantastic and catchy. Above all, the plot covers not only the cons of a criminal life having a great sum of money by fooling other people, but the consequences of hard life times as family divorce (it is worth mentioning that Steven Spielberg focused on this idea very strongly), loneliness, and violence of outer world. Great film, with wonderful screenplay, skillful actors, ingenious director and stunning story. Long story short, it is masterpiece.

And remember, yankees always win because no one can keep their eyese off yankees' damn pinstripes.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Another Hollywood Masterpiece,43748,yshekotka,19 February 2019,"There is a popular belief that if a movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and if it stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, this movie is bound to be successful. However, these factors weren't the only key factors that had made me watch this movie, but also the fact that the main idea is based on real-life events. I just can't resist such movies. So, proceeding to the story itself, it's about a young man being underaged who has the brass to not only to take on the role of a doctor, pilot, lawyer, etc. but to pull a con game on FBI. If it was possible to say that pulling a con game on FBI and on the country, in general, can be described as being professional, I would definitely say that the main character Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) did it professionally. Throughout the duration of the plot, he is chased by an experienced and rule-bounded F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who several times let the DiCaprio's character slip through the fingers. Nonetheless, agent Hanratty manages to do it and the final Frank's escape fails. Fails, but not for long. To be honest, I tried to watch this movie twice, but it was kind of impossible for me. The problem was that I really was not able to catch the plot of it. When watching it for the 3rd time I finally managed to understand the whole idea, the whole story, that seemed to me as something uncatchable. So does Frank Abagnale Jr., so tells us the headline of the movie. I have already noticed that the director is Steven Spielberg. I believe that when you hearing that a movie is going to be made by this great person, you know in advance that it's going to be a masterpiece beginning from the idea and finishing with the way of the picture in general. A great deal of film scenes is considered to be a masterpiece. Also, I like that the story, at first sight, is a criminal, but at the same time, it is sprinkled with romance and humour. I cannot help but notice an amazing. Actually, the director collected all the actors, who you cannot expect less from. Each one fit into an image of their characters. Finally, if you are a fan of true-story movies and tangled storylines with an unexpected run-out, this movie has been created for you. Enjoy watching!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"""People only know what you tell them, Carl"".",43748,Anzhelika92,19 February 2019,"Here we see the true story about Frank William Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars as a pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor escaping from FBI for years. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty has made his prime mission to capture him and bring him to justice, however Frank is always one step ahead of Carl, baiting him to continue the chase.

This story began with the fact that Frank's parents divorced and he needed to decide with whom he wants to stay but he chose a completely different way, he decided to escape from home in order to start a new life. And this desicion changed his life. From the very beginning of the film, I did not think about what would happen at the end, whether Frank would be caught or still not. I just hoped that in the end he would be happy. I had so much fun watching this film and smiled almost every minute. There are so many funny and touching scenes in this film. When Carl Hanratty for a long time tried to catch up with Frank, but all the time he stayed a step away from him until he finally reached his goal, but made the right choice did not put such an outstanding master of fraud checks in prison, and decided to cooperate with him in catching other criminals. It was the perfect end of this story.

In conclusion I can say that it is my favourite film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks played brilliantly. Excellent camera work and soundtrack. The outstanding biography of Frank Abagnale, which became the basis of the script. This film can be given many more different epithets and they will all be absolutely deserved. Only a great director could make such a great movie with an original development of events. Such an extraordinary life could live only a great criminal.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Thought-provocative funny movie,43718,alenashikova,19 February 2019,"What I would like to concentrate on is the idea of the movie.

There arise many issues to think over, for example, family, friends, sense and value of life, money, smartness and others. That is really thought-provocative and make us change our mind on many essential things, maybe even to change yourself, to change your attitude to people surrounding you, to events, to deeds.

While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant. The main characters are perfect at playing, they are alive in their roles and amplua and are pleasant to watch at. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies. This is not just a plain image that we face, this is a real story and the director realized it in full strength.

There are impressive, touching and terrific scenes. In spite of the fact that there are much action in this movie, there are many scenes that touch the spectators and make think. The dialogues are elaborated and beautiful and smart-sounded. I like the style of clothes the characters wear, it's fashionable and tasty-designed. The decorations and all stages are perfectly-elaborated.

The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you. I guess this film represents one of the most impressive achievements of Steven Spilberg. It doesn't leave spectators with a drop of disappointment.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,The Cat and The Check-Forging Mouse,43687,pbk453,19 February 2019,"Catch Me If You Can manages to reach the goal that most of the biographical films strive for. This film manages to captivate the viewer and present a dramatic retelling of the true events without sacrificing the important details that make the original story so appealing in the first place. Sure, it adds an additional historically inaccurate plotline, but these scenes don't take anything away from the experience and only enhance the events as the movie continues to unfold. I truly think that the quality of its screenplay is what makes it so memorable and charming.

The main characters stand out and have just enough time to make an impactful impression on the viewer. From the naive mischievousness of Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Frank Abagnale to the persistency and inspiring commitment of Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. Both of the characters are almost perfectly suited for their roles in this long-running game of «cat and mouse» and the actors make sure that their impressive portrayal of Frank and Carl shows it. The performances also allow for every close call for Frank Abagnale and every small victory of Carl Hanratty to feel like the first one. Emotional hooks are already in you by the time Frank makes his first forged check and they aren't planning on letting you go until you're done with the movie. Also, the original soundtrack is fantastic. Always nailing the tone of the scene, John Williams once again proves his talent as a composer throughout the film. From the beautifully animated intro sequence to the small, almost unnoticeable melodies that serve as wonderful background for this lighthearted story.

Of course, you can probably guess how the story ends even if never knew the true story of Frank Abagnale. The film tries its best to leave you guessing up until the end whether or not will the story of the young check forger end on a high note, but it's obvious that the script never aimed to interpret original events as a complicated story about the morally gray nature of crime and/or a story with a strong focus on how your confidence and wit can help you find a way in and out of every situation in life. It's just a simply structures, feel-good movie with a cheeky tone that can be enjoyed by almost everyone and I'm all for that. It's a great watch and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see an engaging crime story and have fun. If that's what you're after, then Catch Me If You Can is the movie for you.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch me if you can,43748,kaluginaliza,19 February 2019,"Mouse in the bank

The film is based on the book of this Frank Abignale (which did not really control the filming process of director Steven Spielberg) - it came out a bitter tragicomedy about human vices and cynicism. Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) - a master of deception and cheating, who managed to work and the chief physician and pilot of passenger airlines, and assistant prosecutor - and all this to 21, and certainly, with the help of youthful seductiveness, and a small chain, which ""allegedly"" lost many employees. In the film, one can see the unconditional ""influence"" of his father, whose ""rules of life"" he brought to ""unprecedented heights"", and his prayer before dinner in his future wife's house was a story about a mouse: ""Two mice fell into a vessel with milk. One mouse - did not resist, and sank. The other one floundered for a long time, whipped up butter, and climbed to the surface. "" In this story - he is undoubtedly the second mouse. The parents' divorce became the ""catalyst"" of all his actions, where he masterfully falsified bank checks in his name, promised unprecedented profits to his father (remembering his mother - just before arrest, when he saw her juvenile daughter in another family through the window), and in the end, over time, became the most valuable employee of the FBI in the field of fraud. The story of such a ""non-standard"" hero - under the leadership of Steven Spielberg - came out in a very voluminous, dramatic ode about inhuman gain, human weakness and short-sighted, where it seems ""you can get the moon"".",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Too young or too old?,43748,kotyusha-m,19 February 2019,"Striving for something must give a result. This is especially true for people who are stubborn. And it doesn't matter to them how much they have to endure, what difficulties and boundaries to cross, because the main thing is to reach the end point, that is, to achieve result.

But many still can not get what they want. Why so? The answer to this may lie either in a banal laziness, or in another misfortune - the conquest of the unbeaten.

The main character of this film was able to please in the second paradox. In short, he wanted the fact that at that time it was simply not possible. But not so much, he demanded: he wanted to live happily, like most. But what can you do about your parents' divorce? What can you do about the imperfection of the rights of American citizens, who suck all the money out of their beloved father? Many would be humbled, but not Frank. Choosing the right moment, when everyone was in another room, he ran away with a desire to find a way to the old life and fulfillment of all his dreams.

In general, the whole film is focused on this, the most important and most amazing character. What is it amazing, at first incomprehensible. At least in appearance, he appears to us as a typical 16-year-old boy who loves parents and life. But that was for the time being. It can be seen, and in truth, it is said that only a difficult situation determines who we really are. Jack, being once again in a similar, showed himself as a man of a dozen timid, who would hardly just accept disaster. And it seems to be a great advance, but when the usual striving turns into a navischevuyu idea, the bad can not be avoided. Of course, in dreams, he really believed that if he earned more money and became a worthy man, his mother would take it, but would marry his father again, and they would live quietly and peacefully. In fact, it turned out that it would not be possible to quickly become someone significant, so I had to play someone, in the literal sense. From such a ""game"" there were problems with the law, the eternal bustle and, finally, the realization that he is nobody. Why, and with the parents did not work.

However, in all this minus you can find a handful of plus: Frank for such a small period managed to go into the skin, count several people at once. And let him pay for this with complete solitude, yet in the ability to crank it all up and consist, for the most part, its difference from others, its peculiarity. This concerns the most fundamental character. I doubt that he would have become so without the help of the one who brought it to life - Leonardo DiCaprio. Here is his finest hour: he now and then put on various masks. But probably the best he managed to show complete hopelessness, the realization that all dreams have collapsed. And this intersection of the image of the usual ""waking up"", ""matured"" boy and the image of the genius of a mozyinik create something unrealistically huge in terms of acting and plot. Also, at the height of the one who caught the whole film Frank - Karl Henratti, in the performance of Tom Hanks. I was surprised at how different he appears to the audience at the beginning and at the end of the film.

As for the plot, it turned out pretty twisted and interesting. Here, and morality, and the essence, and humor, and drama. In short everything that Spielberg loves so much is the director of the project. So what is the result: a person who has an extraordinary gift to adapt to the role of anyone, a detective, whose ""scent"" amazes and the action itself, where both humor and drama are surprisingly well balanced. In a word, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is an ideal film that will suit both the younger and the younger generation.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch me if you can,43748,sashastarunskiy-13079,19 February 2019,"""Catch Me If You Can""



This is not just a film, not just a story about a boy who deceived everyone and stole several million dollars. This film is a peculiar story about the life of people, and a part of the soul of the director himself. Steven Spielberg seems to have seen himself playing the main role, otherwise it is impossible to explain many facts that speak about the similarity of the life of the main character with the life of the director. Problems in the family, attempts to self-actualize in any way, and early maturing in the mid-60s. These facts make the biography of the protagonist similar to the biography of Spielberg. Sixteen-year-old Spielberg spent all summer vacations at Universal Studios. Every morning he came there in a suit, but none of the guards even thought that this young ""worker"" actually came just to see how the movies were shot.

And so, let's get acquainted with the characters of the film. The protagonist is Frank William Abagneil Jr. Frank is a charming, cunning, clever, and somebody might even say, two-faced, but incredibly kind person, who at the age of eighteen was one of the most sophisticated criminals. What made a wonderful boy and a diligent son become a criminal?

Family. Hard times change people. Frank is inspired by his parents, their pure and strong love is what makes the boy happy. But one moment can destroy everything. Frank's mom starts cheating on his father with his friend. Father lost all his money and property. Marriage does not save. But Frank can not choose a parent with whom he will live, after a divorce, can not accept the destruction of their ideal family happiness. Frank wants to save his family, create all conditions for further prosperity and tries not to let the things that make him happy disappear. He had a terrific skill of transformation. Frank pretended to be a Pan American pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. He made and cashed fake checks for a total of two and a half million dollars.

Uniform, appearance, wrapper - this is what helps to make people believe in anything. If you wear a pilot uniform, then you are a pilot. Four years a young boy confused the police of all states. He plays his game, with transformations and changing forms. He plays with people, considering himself omnipotent, he is sure that at any moment he can stop and spend money with impunity. The main character is dealing with FBI agents who do not intend to joke. Agent Hanratti is not the one who gives up easily and he will not stop the persecution. His goal - to catch a brilliant young criminal, which robbing banks.

If we talk about the actors who performed the roles, then of course, we must be thanked to Leonardo DiCaprio, who more than anyone else approached this role. He was able to demonstrate all the cunning plans of the protagonist, his charisma and poignant wit, and at the same time his kind soul. Tome Hanks, who played the role of Agent Hanratti, despite the not the brightest role, thanks to his skill, complemented the film.

It should be noted acting game Christopher Walken, in the role of Frank Abagneil Sr.. The image of the father occupies an important place in the film. Having everything, he lost it. The only thing left is a son who, until the end of his days, loved his father, and committed crimes for his sake.

I believe that this film is a masterpiece. The film covers the problems of family, society and man. This is not just a comedy story. This film is one of the best works of art.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Fun and Exciting with Heart to Spare,43718,99Tfl,3 December 2018,"Frank Abagnale's exploits are the epitome of the phrase 'the truth is stranger than fiction'. So it was only natural Hollywood would want to turn his story into a film. After going through David Fincher and Gore Verbinski, Steven Spielberg took it on and delivered probably one of his best films from the 2000s, a fun and exciting caper that nonetheless knows when to tug the heartstrings.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale, a teenager who runs away from home when his parents divorce and proceeds to impersonate a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer with few people being the wiser, cashing forged cheques worth millions in the process (anyone wondering why the then-27 year-old DiCaprio was the teenage Abagnale, the real-life Abagnale was noted for looking older than he was really, which greatly aided his cons).

Tom Hanks is Carl Hanratty, the FBI Agent investigating Abagnale's cheque fraud (Hanratty was based on multiple agents involved in the Abagnale case, including John Shea, who Abagnale later befriended). Hanratty insists that cheque fraud is serious to his bosses, and he will capture Abagnale eventually.

Also appearing, before her rise to fame, is Amy Adams as Abagnale's chief love interest, Brenda Strong; Martin Sheen as Brenda's father; and Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr., Frank's father, who encourages his son to continue his activities as revenge for his treatment by the government owing to his IRS problems.

The score by John Williams is light and jazzy, with Williams' influence from mentor Henry Mancini highlighted more than ever and oh-so-memorable. The script by Jeff Nathanson is also up-to-scratch, adapting Frank's most audacious antics faithfully while still changing some things for dramatic effect (or necessity: Frank's story is most likely so convoluted a word-for-word adaptation could never work). And Steven Spielberg's direction and handling anything but messy: hot off science fiction thriller Minority Report, he has energy enough to create a thrilling, adventurous and amazing.

Bottom line: Catch Me If You Can is exciting, enjoyable, and superbly put together for a sly and breezy film that one can watch over and over again.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Innovative false pretenses.,43718,michaelRokeefe,10 April 2018,"Steven Spielberg directs this fun to watch cat and mouse race about a teenage runaway turned con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). The young man is quick witted and innovative enough to pull off a carefree spree of convincing people at various times that he was an airline pilot, a doctor, a college professor and a legal prosecutor without even a high school diploma. And to support this giant pretense is his ability to create and cash millions of dollars in fraudulent checks. All this brilliant deception puts FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) on and off his almost allusive trail.

This crime, bio flick is not without its humorous moments. A real nice soundtrack helps keep this two hour plus flick running smoothly. Some swell tunes by Dusty Springfield, the Lettermen, Erroll Garner, Frank Sinatra, the Chiffons, Stan Getz and Nat 'King' Cole are featured.

The cast also includes: Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, Jennifer Garner, James Brolin, Elizabeth Banks and Nathalie Baye.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A wonderful storyline & the cast,43718,dinkaxd,3 February 2018,"Catch me if you can is the best example of how a great film should be made. The famous director, Steven Spielberg worked hard to do this film unpredictable and to create very interesting plot twists. The film centres on a big lie. We can see a 19 years old boy, Frank Abagnale, his father, the other Frank Abagnale and the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. The story centres on the counterfeiting checks by Frank Abagnale Jr. and on the persecution of Frank with the FBI, and especially Carl Hanratty.

The film begins as Frank parents get divorced. From his father, Frank gets his first 25$ in his checking account. He starts to fake checks because his main goal is to get his parents back together and return his father's money. The film reaches a turning point when police starts to chase him. As the story progresses he begins to change the way he fakes money and becomes a doctor to hide from the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. But the police find his number and Carl phones him. Between them there is an interesting conversation and soon after that Frank was caught by the FBI.

For many people this film became one of the favorites and I know why. The plot is amazing and completely unpredictable. The actors are famous and they were selected professionally. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks perfectly played their characters. The film definitely succeeded, we can see that because this film has now become a classic. I can't see any bad things about this film. Maybe there were a few special effects, but I think drama and crime films don't need that many special effects.

Whatever you like or dislike crime films, you will enjoy this one because of it's storyline. I would recommend this film to anyone who like strong films where there are many great moments where you feel suspense. And I would recommend this film to girls who like Leonardo DiCaprio (he is so young and beautiful in this film).",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Hackers from all over the world unite!,43748,Dr_Coulardeau,23 January 2018,"A funny film about a faultless fraud, a perfect forger who manipulated bank checks and stole a real fortune in the 60s when he was not even out of high school and at the same time he impersonated all types of professions, pilot, doctor, lawyer, and many others all around the world, or nearly, and he ended up in prison in Atlanta for twelve years in total isolation. And yet the FBI who finally caught him in France got him out of the prison in which they had locked him up, because he was the best-qualified forger on the market and they needed him to catch as many of these forgers who were myriads and legions in those years when the two ways to pay for anything was either cash or a check.

Very entertaining in a way though of course, the depth of the story is that you better be a good forger because then you will have a beautiful career in the FBI. The more advanced cases of fraud today is no longer forgers of checks but hackers. The best of these hackers are recruited to work for all kinds of security services, both public and private. It is good to be reminded at times that the worst frauds and the best forgers of anything, hackers or Internet fraud-artists, are often working for the CIA, the FBI, Homeland Security or the big corporation like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.

And with Artificial Intelligence it becomes ever easier to set up a scam of any sort that can access millions of computers in the world and create chaos here or there. At the same time, it is often a lot easier to counter such actions with Artificial Intelligence too. The attack from the USA against the nuclear centrifuges in Iran some years ago was identified and blocked by other hackers and AI specialists from Belarus, California and a couple more places.

That should make us think twice before launching any propaganda against such frauds, actions, cyberwar acts, because if a digital system is attacked, it's because its security is underdeveloped, or if a social network is used to spread fake news or whatever rumors to influence public opinion here or there, it cannot be stopped nor prevented except with censorship, and even so there is always a way to go around this censorship and reach a disturbing objective here and there, in any country you can think of. Cybercrime and cyberwar are the prices we have to pay for cyberspace and cyber communication. It is better to build some efficient defense than to cry, yell and scream because after a while no one believes there is a fire in the house or there is a wolf in the poultry yard.

Society as a factory of criminals By Dr Jacques COULARDEAU on March 31, 2003

In this film Steven Spielberg wants to entertain us with a simple plot, a simple situation, a great chase around the world. He wants to entertain us with two characters who are highly attractive. The young man who becomes a criminal because his father is harrassed by the IRS and whose wife is stolen away by his best friend can easily become a symbol of fighting back, resilience, rebellion, intelligence against a system that tries to crush all those who may be antisocial, or just appear to be antisocial. The second character of the cop who is chasing this young man is just as attractive.

Divorced, having lost wife and daughter, abandoned and isolated in his personal life, living the life of a hermit, of a monk of the law against crime, he easily becomes a father substitute to the young man and chases him with real paternal care and even maybe love. This relation between the criminal and the cop is amazingly reassuring. The young criminal becomes a hero because he attacks the economic system and is more intelligent than the businessmen and CEOs of this system.

The cop becomes a hero because he is not viciously chasing a criminal he is ready to kill if necessary, but he chases him to protect him against his own desire to fool the system, and to give him the opportunity to really become « social » by using his talent and his intelligence against the criminals who attack the system. This will lead me to the conclusion on this point : this film is in a way a denunciation of the economic and political system that tries to destroy its opponents by all means available, including in their private life, due to a total lack of ethics on the side of the proponents of this system.

Why does our system produce such a phenomenal highjacking of intelligence into crime ? But the film also has another interest. Leonardo Di Caprio reveals himself as able to impersonate many characters and personalities in this film and this is the proof that he is improving and developing. He is able to become, in the near future, a good and even great actor, provided his body and face are put aside and his acting talent is emphasized. That is all the more important because he is getting old and will no longer be able to play the handsome and lovable teenagers he has played so often. He is entering the real profession : he is enabled by this film to show that he can act with his soul and not only with his body.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Steve's Film Page on Facebook,43718,gorillaz-96353,9 June 2017,"This is one of the greatest films ever made and, like many great films, it became so through happenstance. Catch Me If You Can was sat on for twenty years and then went through several star actors and directors before DiCaprio, Hanks, and Spielberg took the reins. While I have my grievances about Tom Hanks in this film, he was at least a good stepping stool for DiCaprio. This is personally one of my favorite Leo performances, an opportunity not wasted to showcase his incredible range. As for Spielberg, most critics will label this film as not one of his best, but I ostensibly disagree. Can you imagine if Verbinski or Fincher directed this? The central motif would have been drowned by overzealous desires to focus on audiences' base attraction to rebellion. Spielberg's finesse and directorial impulse control were perfect for this film. He was uniquely qualified to tackle the melancholy themes in Catch Me If You Can and have them wrapped up and presented in a beautiful, lighthearted package that was just right for the Christmas season. Anachronisms and Hanks aside, this film is a fun and powerful message to those in and from broken homes. Top 150 film. 9/10 — ￼watching Catch Me If You Can.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent,43748,tupungato,21 May 2017,"This movie certainly entertains, but a viewer can find it as suspenseful as he does informative, touching, and powerful, given that such a con- artist, who deceived hospital administrators, airline pilots, and lawyers, and made the FBI look unprofessional and foolish, really did exist. Christopher Walken does a commendable job as Frank Abagnale Senior, the failed father who exudes irresponsibility and has a victim's ready excuse for his mistakes. Interesting to see how Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio), though he grows to see his father more clearly, deals with his hurt by acting out some of his father's antisocial behavior, becoming that of which he most disapproves in a parent. Frank Abagnale Jr. seems to have found the mentor he would have preferred in Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the determined and ethical FBI agent who finally catches up to the fast-talking fraud.

CatchMeIfYouCan,What took me so long?,43718,LiquidPoetry1921,22 February 2017,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Captivating from beginning to end, Frank Abagnale, Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) amazes the audience with how flawlessly he can fake his way out of a tight jam. Just when you think 'they've got him this time', he manages to extract himself from the perilous dilemma ~ his cunning even astounding him sometimes!

The only reason I gave this flick 9 stars instead of 10 was for a couple of minor issues I had with it. I thought the voice Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) used for this role was unnecessarily muddled with an indiscernible accent. His own voice would have sufficed just fine for the part and didn't need to be changed to enhance the role. As well, the 'interesting' relationship between Frank, Jr.'s mother and father at the beginning of the film was completely unnecessary and didn't add anything to make the movie more interesting. However, I can see why Christopher Walken (Frank Abagnale, Sr.) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor ~ for the incredible influence he had as the con-artist dad grooming the con-artist son, but not for the awkward scenes he had with his wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye). Perhaps that entire scenario was created for artistic effect...I just found it a boring waste of time.

However, that was the ONLY boring thing about 'Catch Me if You Can'! Once again, a Steven Spielberg production that did not disappoint!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Years for the pursuit of his mother and Carl,43748,sun-shine-number,29 January 2017,"It was the definitely the art of the movie. It was chasing between Frank and Carl. But I assume it was also chasing between him mom and Carl.

Frank, main character watched the scene of infidelity. It was no wonder shocking for him. But he was also shocked after watching the divorcing of his parents. That would be a reason he took advantage of women. But they were also subjects of his love. There would be his belief for the god because he hesitated to pray. There are also some scenes implying his personality of which the most interesting is the chat when Frank tried to leave the country after being caught. He did not escape because he was glad to be chased.

He chose and believed Carl as if he were real parent or the subject of attachment. It would one of my favourites. I rated 8/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Like Father, Like son",43718,Hitchcoc,8 January 2017,"This is a very good dramatic film. Frank W. Abignale is a successful con man. Sometimes he uses his skills by design; sometimes he uses it to get away from threats to his identity. This is a young man who is so traumatized by his parents' divorce, but because his father knew how to con people, he learned to do what his father did. He is not a mere con man, but a young guy with incredible skills. He passes himself off as a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, and on and on. Leonardo DeCaprio plays Abignale and Tom Hanks is the rather humorless FBI agent who makes Frank his number one project. The interaction is interesting because the two begin to like each other. Abignale actually starts to find a father figure in Hanks' character. This is based on a real character, the object of an autobiography.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Awesome,43748,Takethispunch,5 January 2017,"In 1963, teen-aged Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) lives in New Rochelle, New York with his father Frank Abagnale, Sr. (Christopher Walken), and French mother Paula (Nathalie Baye).

CatchMeIfYouCan,A Different Kind of Spielberg Film,43718,cdjh-81125,26 November 2016,"If I had no idea who directed this movie and I was told to guess Steven Spielberg would not been my first guess, but believe it or not that's a great thing, it shows that Spielberg is willing to change things up and try new things and this is definitely one of his better movies. This is a film that is extreme well written, entertaining and funny all in one I loved this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was so good in this film he really sunk himself into this con man but through his performance you can tell that he isn't a bad person just a lost kid refusing to face reality which makes him a much more interesting character. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film not only is he really funny but he had great scenes with DiCaprio, you really got the impression that these two were each others equals and it was riveting to watch. Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances ever in this film I thought he had some really touching scenes with DiCaprio and he was a really tragic character. John Williams gives one of his best scores ever to this film, the theme is jazzy and alive and matches perfectly with the tone of the film. A lot of the entertainment value for this movie comes from seeing Abagnale change in and out of his different personas, not only does it create for a lot of laughs but it was really interesting to see how he was able to accomplish all his misdeeds. I do have a couple of flaws with this movies for one a lot of character arcs such as Amy Adams arc just do not get a real conclusion and are left dangling in the air. My other flaw may seem like a minor one or a nitpick but there were a lot of unbelievable aspects in this film namely scenes where DiCaprio makes clear and obvious mistakes and are just written of as funny scenes, which they are but I just think it took me out of the movie a bit.

Another than one or two minor nitpick I think this is a fantastic film, one of Spielbergs better films for sure, it's got some great performances, a really different and catchy score from John Williams and a tone different from other Spielberg films that just continues to show me his incredible range as a director.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"A brilliant story, with stunning acting, and a gripping plot",43718,Tkbn3812,26 September 2016,"Catch Me If You Can is quite a unique film, one of which is to be commended for the beautiful way it tells a magnificent story. Directed by the great Steven Spielberg, it recounts the true story of Frank Abagnale, one of history's greatest imposters. Spielberg has portrayed a story that has viewers connecting with the characters, with a well-paced narrative that is bound to both impress and shock the audience, alongside spectacular acting, and a simple yet intriguing musical score to couple the most tense scenes.

Frank Abagnale is your typical 60s teenager. A 16 year old, he is an only child living with his parents, a simple yet sufficient life.

But his whole world is turned upside over the course of a few weeks. When the IRS come after Frank's father for unpaid taxes, the family is forced to move into a small apartment; not much time passes before the two parents separate. This is the turning point for Frank, and sends him on a journey that will go down in history as one of the most remarkable stories of an imposter.

So begins a story that spans three years, three jobs, almost $6 million in stolen money, counterfeit checks, not to mention a wedding, and tells the story of both the teen on his crime spree, and the FBI agent who will stop at nothing to catch him.

Frank Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, with FBI agent Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. These are two big names of Hollywood that do remarkably well in their individual roles. DiCaprio plays Abagnale in a realistic manner, bringing out the teenager's sly nature, while also taking into account his more human side, of which pushes him out on his journey in the first place.

Tom Hanks was an excellent choice as the FBI agent; his acting is convincing, as he portrays the workaholic as a tough, no-nonsense guy who has a troubling backstory and, deep down, a heart.

Frank Abagnale Senior, played by Christopher Walken, plays a pivotal role in the plot. It is the financial troubles that Frank Junior sees his father in that in turn encourage him to set out on his journey of three jobs.

Amy Adams, who as Brenda Strong plays Abagnale's bride, seems to have been an unusual inclusion. Nothing eventually comes of this proposed marriage, and as convincing an actor as DiCaprio is, it at no point seems as though Abagnale is truly in love. Perhaps this is intentional, however, considering the outcome.

There are several minor characters in the film, including Martin Sheen as Brenda's father and Natalie Baye as Frank's French mother. Cheryl Ann is played by Jennifer Ann, in a short and unnecessary scene of which, again, nothing comes out of.

It is in fact from the moment that Frank leaves the US that everything begins to fall apart. The scene of which involves his eventual arrest in France sees DiCaprio let down his performance a little, switching from a character who is in control to that of one now distressed. After this, the relationship between Abagnale and his capturer, Hanratty, is built up; for the most part this is successful, however there are some flaws. The scene where Abagnale nearly leaves the country again is not particularly realistic. Clearly Hanratty had enough faith in Abagnale to believe he would not leave, and while this is what happens, surely he would not take the risk?

The film features yet another unique and beautiful score from John Williams, who approaches scenes of action with a jazzy motif, of which makes a two minute debut in the opening credits. The actual theme for the movie contrasts this motif, and is a pleasant tune with hemiolas, a trademark Williams-styled theme reminiscent of ET and Jurassic Park in its instrumentation. This score is truly a positive for the film.

However, as with all films based on true stories, there are certain aspects that need to be pointed out. There was no planned wedding in Abagnale's real life; while he does eventually marry, this is actually after his release from prison. His parents were never in financial trouble, and in fact Frank's first victim of fraud was his father himself.

While Frank did have a relationship with an FBI agent, it was not to the extent seen in the film. He most certainly did not call him every Christmas; the real Frank Abagnale called the prospect of calling the man in charge of capturing him absurd.

One thing that isn't stressed enough in the film is the fact that Abagnale committed most of his fraud before the age of 19. There is no way that Abagnale looked 28 (DiCaprio's age at time of filming) when he was only a teenager, and if it were made more clear he was a teen for most of the film the audience may have been even more impressed by his crimes.

However the film is right to portray a criminal in a positive light; the real Abagnale has gone on to assist the FBI and other crime agencies in counter-fraud measures, from his experience in the real world.

Overall, this is a pleasant watch that will certainly leave a positive impression on viewers. Remarkable acting from DiCaprio and Hanks are the highlights of the film, with a plot that, regardless of inaccuracies, is simple yet interesting. The music score by far is a positive, with in-depth character development that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.

Although the film has flaws specifically in its romance, it wins in almost every other aspect, keeping viewers connected to the story. The film certainly is to be commended in the way it portrays a troubled teenager and the man sent out to stop him. It most definitely succeeds at telling the true story of a real fake.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Filmmaker's Dream-Come-True,43718,seymourblack-1,9 August 2016,"This fact-based story about con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. is a filmmaker's dream-come-true because it's absolutely incredible, outrageously funny and features an extraordinary protagonist. Based on his autobiography (which he wrote with Stan Redding), it charts Abagnale's exploits as a teenager who made millions of dollars through cheque fraud, travelled extensively at no cost to himself and assumed a number of fake identities with such success that he quickly achieved a glamorous lifestyle, great personal wealth and the attentions of numerous young women. Inevitably, his activities also attracted the attention of the FBI and led to him getting involved in a protracted cat-and-mouse game with one of their agents.

Frank enjoys a perfectly happy upbringing in New Rochelle, New York until his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), starts to experience problems with the IRS over some unpaid tax and can't raise a loan to cover the shortfall. As a result, Frank Sr. loses his retail business, his car and his home and has to move his family into a small apartment. Soon after, Frank's French mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) has an affair with one of Frank Sr's fellow Rotarians and this leads to the collapse of their marriage and the painful divorce that follows. Frank is devastated by the loss of his happy family life and runs away from home.

Frank looks older than his age and in his new circumstances, soon discovers that he has a natural ability to perpetrate cons by masquerading as an airline pilot and forging various documents and cheques. The wealth and respect that he gains through his activities give him a great deal of confidence and so, when FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) catches up with him at a hotel and confronts him at gunpoint, Frank simply claims to be a Secret Service Agent who'd also been pursuing the elusive Mr Abagnale Jr. and walks away from the premises before Hanratty realises that he's been duped.

Frank goes on to pose as a doctor at a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia where he meets and falls in love with a sweet young nurse called Brenda (Amy Adams) who wears braces on her teeth and is worried about losing her job. When he meets Brenda's parents, he claims that he's also a qualified lawyer, like her father Roger (Martin Sheen) who's a district attorney and then gets taken on as Roger's assistant. Numerous surprising developments follow before Frank is eventually given an opportunity to rehabilitate himself in a most unexpected way.

Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating character and Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely shines in this role as it fully exploits his ability to be charismatic and funny whilst also subtly hinting at the vulnerability and sadness that remain with Frank as a result of his parents' divorce. The surprising relationship that he develops with the rather dull and humourless Hanratty is also an enjoyable feature of the story and becomes quite credible because of the grudging admiration that the FBI man has for Frank and the common ground that they share (both having lost their highly valued family lives). In a movie full of top class performances, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams all make a tremendous impression.

The 1960s-type opening credits do a great job of establishing the period within which the action takes place and also signal the playful, upbeat style of presentation that contributes so strongly to all the fun that follows. As a highly amusing ""stranger the fiction"" story, ""Catch Me If You Can"" not only has a huge appeal that crosses many demographics but also, with its family drama, comedy and moments of suspense, provides such rich entertainment that it's no surprise that it did so well at the box office.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Not a typical spielberg movie, but enjoyable (Spoilers)",43656,dom-taylor,15 June 2004,"I enjoyed watching this movie, despite it features one of my least favourite actors, Leoanrdo Di Caprio. Tom Hanks gives a good peformance, although, compared to his performance in 'Saving private Ryan', it sucked.

The movie has an excellent twist, as we see how the main character 'Frank Abagnale' cons thousands of people, when he relentlessly continues to pay for expensive purchases, when the amount cannot be obtained from his account. Although I thought the film in general was fairly good, it didn't seem to be a movie made by Spielberg. To me, Spielberg seems to create superb master pieces again and again, for example; Schindler's list, and saving private ryan; and, this film seemed to be directed by a more novice director.

Having said that, the characters, acting and dialogue are very good, and the movie concludes with a big thums up!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Well worth catching,43718,oshram-3,6 June 2004,"This movie received a lot of hype when it came out, but I never got the chance to see it until this week (courtesy once again of the library, thank you very much). I'd heard good things about it, and I figured any film that involved Spielberg and hanks would be worth a look.

The movie chronicles the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man who sees his father's (Christopher Walken) slow descent into poverty and decides to help him by applying his particular kind of genius into a bold but extremely clever fraud scheme. Frank is soon passing himself off as a pilot for TWA, and his schemes only get bolder from there. Assigned to catch him is determined Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who lacks Frank's brilliance but makes up for it with dogged persistence.

The movie is very skillfully handled. Spielberg has a number of terrific shots sprinkled throughout (the moment where Carl realizes he's actually spoken with Frank and didn't know it is classic), and the feel of the 60s is deftly captured. DiCaprio really does look like he's fifteen or sixteen through most of it, and all of the small subtle period details are captured. We're also shown a great deal more than we are told; while Frank is a genius, we are never told that, but we see how his schemes unfold, part accident and part inspiration, and we come to sympathize with him even though he is a criminal. In fact it's a testament to the skill of the writing and directing that although the characters are at odds with one another and have conflicting goals, we can somehow root for them both.

Hanks is his usual excellent self, and his Carl is a character we immediately like, even if he is a bit gruff around the edges. DiCaprio surprised me because he fits into the role seamlessly; I've never seen him be this natural or effective before, and it gave me new respect for him as an actor (he really needs to stay away from period stuff). His performance is the more important one, because naturally the bulk of the film centers on him. Christopher Walken is also very strong as Frank's father, a man whose life slowly crumbles beneath him yet who never gives up fighting for something better (it's never made clear if he did anything wrong in his past to elicit such attention from the IRS, which normally would be a drawback but in this case is oddly effective). The rest of the cast is excellent too, and Martin Sheen gives a nice turn in a smaller role.

In the end we see that Frank really could have been someone amazing had he just buckled down and worked for it  that he did so well with so little is also a testament to his pluck and intelligence. But Spielberg and his cast manage to present an interesting and entertaining story that never lags and keeps us wrapped up in its twists and turns from start to finish. In the last few years Spielberg has made his share of lackluster films (AI, Minority Report) but Catch Me If You Can is not one of them. A strong effort from some gifted people at the top of their games, Catch is certainly worth a rental. It's a little long at two and a half hours, but it's certainly worth the investment of your time.

One minor note: John William's score is extremely effective and one of his better works in recent years. It marries perfectly to the visuals and is simply outstanding.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A pretty good movie,43748,crowrobot,31 May 2004,"I really liked 'Catch Me If You Can'. Now, I am willing to forgive Leonardo DiCaprio for all the bombs he's been in lately. I'm also willing to forgive Christopher Walken for the same reason. DiCaprio, Walken, and Tom Hanks are all strong in their performances. This is a very enjoyable Spielberg film. Now, granted, I've liked everything I've seen of Spielberg's work and have yet to see a bad movie by him. Also, the bouncy John Williams score is a nice touch. Another good performance is by Jennifer Garner as a ""model"". The story was good, directly told, and this movie is just an enjoyable two hours you can watch again and again. Really. You'll want to watch it again and again. I give it a 10/10.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Groovy film.,43748,hollyandcat,18 May 2004,"I loved the book and the film but thought the film could have included more of the books exploits such as him starting on his dad by ripping him off at the petrol place. The petrol place gave him money for things such as tyres, kept the items to sell and put the bill on the dads card. Thus he got money to spend on the ladies and his dad got a hefty bill. I thought Leonardo was an excellent choice to play the young conman seeming to fit the part. He just worked as frank. I thought people could have been more suspicious of the stewardesses and what he was doing with so many new stews but i guess they jusy thought lucky him. Basically i liked both the film and book a lot and would recommend both.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can',43687,rah604,23 April 2004,"Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the kid who ran away from home and became a con-artist. Frank successfully impersonates a co-pilot, a doctor and we find that he has other surprises up his sleeve. In the process, Frank uses over two million dollars via forged checks.

In 'Catch Me If You Can', director Steven Spielberg strays away from his sci-fi explorations (AI, Minority Report) and gets back to the basics. By that I mean, that he makes a simple movie (no superlative heroes or special effects) that everyone can enjoy. The entire cast excels here. DiCaprio, uses charm and wit in his performance as the scheming Frank. Hanks is funny in his turn as a nerdy and obsessive FBI agent. Walken gives his strongest performances in years in a small, but pivotal, role as Frank's father.

Even though the pace of the film slows a bit during the last third, it is still a witty and immensely entertaining film. This one's a real catch.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A very entertaining movie....,43687,Christophe44,30 March 2004,"After two science-fiction films (AI and Minority Reports) who where not exempt from reproaches but also very attractive, Steven Spielberg stays into the realm of entertainment. But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are not longer there. With `Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tend to be just like a young director who's searching new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing some kind of new themes.

Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale - Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, he has nothing to prove.

The only reproach we can make is the stereotyped vision that Spielberg has in his representation of the woman. Nathalie Baye is sympathetic in his French wife role, but it's in fact his whole character that poses a problem :the opportunist French wife who doesn't assume his maternal duty. This role makes us believe that for Spielberg, the subtlety is only a man's thing.

Apart from some imperfections, Catch me if you can is a very good movie...if you like entertainment.",pos

Tom Hanks steals the show, while Leo DiCaprio is bearable (which is a good thing concerning his other roles). I guess this has way deviated from the real story, some things depicted just can't happen. An honorable mention must be made for the fantastic opening titles.

Leonardo DiCaprio has always been an incredible actor (I think so anyway) - I'm not a huge fan of his, but you gotta hand it to the guy - he's an amazing actor. His expressions and dialogue delivery are very natural. He pulled this role off perfectly. Tom Hanks as expected, was great. This man can do anything. Anything. Every role fits him perfectly. I don't care what this guy plays, I'll go see him everytime. And of course, Spielberg rules.

If you haven't seen this movie, get off the computer, NOW and go and rent it. No, don't rent it, BUY it. It's worth every cent!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Perfect Balance,43687,DanB-4,12 December 2003,"Credibility is an odd thing - either you have it or you don't. And one of its key elements is believing you have it yourself. If you act in a certain way, people will respond in a certain way. This theme which was so beautifully portrayed in ""Being There"" is central to Catch Me If You Can. Early in the film, Frank Abagnale sees a pilot and notices that everyone around him adores and admires him, and most importantly, does not question him when he cashes a cheque. Solution: Become a pilot. All you need is lingo (which he gets by fawning over an airport official) and a uniform (which he cons his way into).

From here, we get the story of one of histories great con men, who before his 23rd birthday has successfully convinced people he was a pilot and doctor and a lawyer and had passed $4,000,000 of bad cheques. It it s wonderful light and entertaining ride.

Catch Me If You Can is a major accomplishment for most directors, but for Speilberg, it is like a weekend off - a movie he made to take a break from making movies. Not to say that it is bad - it is a chase movie with more laughs than most comedies and extraordinary attention to detail. It recreates the innocent, pre-Vietnam 60's beautifully, a time when an airline pilot had instant credibility and charm.

The movies three leads, DiCaprio Hanks and Walken are all at the top of their game. Having fun with there roles while at the same time creating memorable characters we care about. FBI agent Carl Hanratty is a dry-as-toast career fed with little more in life than the crooks he chases, but still, Hanks gives him depth and a personality. Christopher Walken is perfect is an odd role for him as Frank Sr., the beloved and hapless father of the anti-hero lead, who never quite gets the breaks in life he wants or deserves.

But In Abagnale Jr Leo Di Caprio creates a criminal character we cheer for. As I watched this film, I was simultaneously cheering for both the bad guy and the cop.

A tad over long, but Catch Me If You Can is a movie worth watching, and even owning. ***1/2 out of ****.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,thoughts of mortality swirl through my mind,43656,drunken_critic,21 November 2003,"On the drive home from the movie I found myself thinking about my life and compared it to the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. This movie is based on a true story. Frank's story is very intriguing and exotic. It is about a man that in the late 1960's that makes a living through fraud. He writes bad checks, imitates professionals such as doctor, lawyer, and airline captain. He made millions of dollars living this way. At this rate it will take me two or three lifetimes to make the money he made. He lived like a god for about 4 years. It makes me want to just try to make one big score. This movie is an inspiration to me to do `wrong' for profit. If only I could have one chance to make big money. I would go for it. Yeah right, I don't have the courage to do it. That is why movies exist. It is escapism for the average man, ME! 7/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Slick, Feel Good Movie",43687,Manthorpe,10 November 2003,"I normally don't like Leonardo in films after that disgrace known as Titanic was released (even though it didn't really have anything to do with him), however I'm glad that did not sway me from watching this movie.

Possible SPOILERS: maybe, not sure yet.

I like to keep it simple. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a slick counterfeiter/conman with Tom Hanks from the FBI always hot on his heels. Based on a true story. Frank had a troubled family life and after a surprising separation of his parents after his Mom has problems keeping her legs together. Frank loses it and decides to run away, only to return to visit his father, Christopher Walken, from time to time. I especially enjoyed Walken in this film. His relationship with his son, Leo, in the movie was rather realistic and reminded me of mine with my father. Walken fans will enjoy seeing him in this film, even though he doesn't play his normal evil self. I also enjoyed Hanks and Leo's relationship in the movie as it resembled a father son relationship. Frank cares for Carl(Hanks), and Carl cares about Frank, even though it is his job to catch him and throw him in prison. And you can't help but to admire how Frank always outsmarts Carl throughout the film.

Being a Spielberg film, one can expect the typical happy ending. And although I normally don't buy into such fluff, it worked for me in this film. It has a few quirky moments, but overall it was a good effort and I would enjoy watching it again. If you like any of the cast in any of their other films, I recommend this movie. Overall, I give it an 8.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Very fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying!",43687,KwanHoFans,18 October 2003,"I watched this movie on DVD last night--what a pleasant surprise! Well, I can't imagine any movie with Spielberg as director and Tom Hanks/Leo DiCaprio as lead actors to be anything less than good, but not having seen the trailer to the movie nor read reviews of it I wasn't sure what kind of a film to expect. Knowing that this movie is based on real life events of Frank Abagnale Jr. makes it all the more enjoyable to watch, while I cannot stop myself from wondering how on earth he was able to pull it all off--as pilot, doctor, and lawyer. I'm sure he must have run into some difficulties at times with his pretense, yet he must have been able to react quickly and avert near-disasters until the time he's finally caught. I really liked his character as DiCaprio portrayed him, despite the fact that the essence of what he did was wrong. Tom Hanks, as usual, did an excellent job--I ended up liking his character as well even though he started off being rather dislikeable. Christopher Walken also wins high points for his portrayal as the senior Abagnale, bringing a certain dignity and believability to his character that wins our empathy in spite of his shady dealings and troubles with the IRS. In short, I ended up liking just about everything in this movie. It was a very well-presented story and a well-acted drama, with humour sprinkled in just the right amounts and at the right places, in my opinion. The pace is just fast enough to keep me entertained and thinking at all times, without loosing me in any overly convoluted subplots. Kudos to Spielberg for such a fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying piece of film-making!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Leo Deserves an Oscar,43748,v1nig,2 October 2003,"I'm not a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. But I was really impressed by his performance in this film, even more so than Gangs of New York. I'm really surprised he was not nominated by the Academy. He perfectly captured the character's misfit and yet innocent personality. It would be hard not to be charmed by him. The film was witty and it didn't bore me for one second. As always, Tom Hanks was fabulous, as well as Chris Walken. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!! Grade A

CatchMeIfYouCan,Best movie in ages,43718,phylly3,7 September 2003,"I give this movie top rating! It's a MUST SEE. If you didn't know that it was a true story you might think it was too far-fetched. That's what makes it so intriguing. Very good acting from Leonardo and Tom Hanks. My only complaint would be that the mother's character was a bit difficult for me to figure out. The look of the film is also just right. It stayed in my mind for days after and led me to do a bit of research on the real-life character. Apparently the movie stayed very close to the autobiography except for the father's character. His role was enlarged for the movie, perhaps to help explain Leonardo's character's motivations. Don't miss this one!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Definitely caught my eye.,43718,LebowskiT1000,9 August 2003,"When I first saw the trailers for this film I didn't think it looked like anything spectacular. Although, I am a fan of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, so I wasn't going to miss this collaboration. I must say that I was definitely pleasantly surprised, the film was much more than I imagined and really quite fun.

The story is just incredible, and what really blows my mind is that it's based on a true story. There also a great deal more to the story than the obvious, it's not just about a kid that breaks the law and eventually gets caught, there are a number of subplots that make the story infinitely more interesting. Not only is the story and subplots great, the but the characters, the portrayal of the characters and the chemistry between them are just perfect.

Of course the great Steven Spielberg always puts on a great show, but this was particularly good. I think the best way to put it is that Spielberg really nailed the feel of this film right on the nose, and was very consistent in his style. I know there's been a few of his films that had certain scenes or lines that I felt were out of place or oddly placed, but this film didn't have anything like that, everything worked perfectly. Then there's the always great, Tom Hanks! A truly gifted actor, he ALWAYS puts on a good show and doesn't let you down here. Leonardo DiCaprio was an excellent choice for the role of Frank Abagnale Jr., and really nailed the role. He has the ability to look older or younger than he really is when needed, not an ability every actor has. Other cast members that should be noted are Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Nathalie Baye, and Jennifer Garner, all pulling off great performances.

This is definitely a Spielberg film not to be missed. Do yourself a favor and make sure that you see this film. Even if you are like me and don't think that it looks terribly appealing, give it a shot, you may be surprised. There is virtually nothing I didn't like about this film, which is a somewhat rare thing for me to say. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,

CatchMeIfYouCan,Suprisingly enjoyable,43656,lotus_chief,8 August 2003,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED**

I was skeptical about this film, because I know how sappy Spielberg could be, and I am in no way a fan of DiCaprio. Although, after seeing this film, I'd have to admit that I enjoyed it. The appeal with this film, above all else in my opinion, is the facination you're forced to have with Dicaprio's character....just HOW did he get away with all of that!?!?! It didn't seem to me that Spielberg involved himself too much in this film, and I must admit that DiCaprio shines in his lead role. It seems that he is finally starting to come into his own as a decent actor. Christopher Walken (a favorite of mine) was great as always. Tom Hanks, suprisingly, was tolerable as well...it was refreshing to see him in a role where you're not forced to see him as an immortal, or always feel sorry for him. He played his role straight-up and I enjoyed him. The story was told very well, although I thought the film was a bit too long. One thing I didn't quite get though...whatever happened to the gameshow sequence in the beginning of the film? That was never explained. Anyway, this film is not a classic by any means, but was suprisingly good and I would recommend it to true fans of 'cinema'. 3 out of 4 stars.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,What FUN !!,43748,sundownlady,27 July 2003,"I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard I couldn't finish my popcorn! I lost it during the discussion in the principal's office about the 14 year-old Frank holding parent/teacher meetings.

It was slow at times, but at least those moments allowed me to compose myself. Christopher Walken, as always, was EXCELLENT!

Definitely a 10 in my book

CatchMeIfYouCan,"DiCaprio makes up for ""Gangs ...""",43687,senortuffy,21 July 2003,"This is a very funny comedy/drama about a young kid who goes on a binge around the country posing as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Expertly directed by Steven Spielberg, this is one of his finest, and shows a side of him I didn't think was there.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr. and Christopher Walkin plays his father, Frank, Sr. The two are an absolute gas together. Senior's life is going down the tubes - his business goes under, the IRS is harassing him, and his wife leaves for another man. The happy home young Frank knows is no longer there.

The father gives a healthy disrespect for the law and authority to his son, so young Frank decides one day to pose as an airline pilot. He learns how to make fake identifications and phony airline checks, and off he goes. In short time, he's living the lifestyle of a swinging bachelor, even though he's still a teenager. He gets away with it because he's a great con artist and thinks quick on his feet, and he's so good at producing fake payroll checks that the FBI is soon on his tail.

Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent after DiCaprio, and he does his usual superb acting job, playing the agent as a determined loner. Without giving up the details, Hanks eventually catches the young man, who after exhausting his airline pilot facade has gone on to pose as a doctor in charge of an emergency room and then a lawyer. The kid is so good at what he does, that the FBI hires him in lieu of a stiff sentence so that he can teach them how criminals manipulate the banking system.

This film is absolutely charming. The acting is great and the viewer is enthralled at the amazing exploits of this young criminal. Walkin in particular deserved an Oscar (he was only nominated for best supporting actor). His manic character and determination are the inspiration by which his son embarks on his adventurous life of crime. And after his disastrous performance in ""Gangs of New York,"" it's nice to see DiCaprio rebound with a winner.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Great,43718,mrincodi,20 July 2003,"A great movie. It's not ""the story of how the policeman chases the con artist"". No, it's plenty more: it's a story full of values, of family sense, of lonely people struggling for the meaning of their lives... The story of a man that...

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD ...that fights for his family to be reunited: I mean, Mr. Abagnale is not a lazy person. He just don't take the moral, legal way for achieving what he wants, but this man battles for what he wants. And Mr. Hanratty (another lone person) hardly could be better performed than for Tom Hanks. Great, full of sense. Also, excellent recreation of the 60's and 70's.

END OF SPOILERS

My rating: 9/10.

Go watch it. You won't be dissapointed.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Ever dreamt of being someone else - What if you just did it?,43718,cbudtz,10 July 2003,"This film is highly underestimated by my opinion. But of course, if you never felt that you would like to do something else and more important, this film must be a bore. I'm the type of guy who likes to plan a bank robbery just for the fun of it or to imagine I was very important person and got away with it by bluffing, and to me this film was all that. This clever boy travels across the world, charming the ladies and spending money, always keeping one step ahead of the cops in the most cunning way. I liked this film for its main character which is actually played well by Leo. And if you can recognize any of the above in your daydreams, it's a movie for you. Strait 9 from me...

CatchMeIfYouCan,Enjoyable but too long.,43656,CharltonBoy,11 July 2003,"Catch me if you can is an enjoyable film that has a certain something that you cant put your finger on.Perhaps it is the DeCaprio charm or maybe it is the Tom Hanks factor that makes this very watchable but dont be fooled into thinking this is as good as everbody says because it does have one very poor floor.The problem with Catch Me If You Can is that it is one of those film that starts at the end then goes back to the begining and keeps switching to the end again and this really spoils the movie. We dont want to know what happens at the start we want to find out at the end!Only films like Momento can pull this off and this is no Momento. The acting is good and i would say the best display is from Christopher Walken and we should see more from this highly underrated actor. All in all not a bad film but it could have had 20 minutes shaved off of it. 7 out of 10.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Charmed, I'm sure!(maybe one spoiler.)",43718,Ironboundfw,1 July 2003,"What a charmer of a film this was. Leonardo DeCaprio was breezy,delightfully fun as the lead. and Tom Hanks, was perfect as the FBI agent chasing after him. The Knock, Knock line is a classic.

But most importantly, the screenplay was truly outstanding. I can imagine the screenwriter having a BALL writing the script, enjoying himself immensely after he wrote, page, after page of clever dialogue, fun moments, and narrow escapes. I felt like I was living the experience along with the character.

What can I say, that hasn't already been said about the director, Steven Spieldberg, he is beyond criticism at this point, although, I have found in his last few films, that he just doesn't know how to end them. A.I. went on for much too long, and the ending of Minority Report, well, it had about 3 different endings... With this film, the ending seemed to always be around the corner. But then again, it wasn't, I was ready for the movie to end at the airport, where much of it had happened symbollically, but then there was an extra scene... but with such a clever, magical script, I really didn't mind if it had kept on going.

Catch it, if you can!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,what a delightful surprise !,43687,rupie,1 July 2003,"I passed this by when I saw it on the racks because I had never heard of it and because 'Titanic' ruined Leonardo deCaprio for me. However I caught a trailer for it at the beginning of the film I wound up renting that day, and was intrigued. It was my subsequent rental, and turned out to be a delightful surprise, and one of the best movies I have seen lately.

Right at the start, Spielberg is making a nostalgic gesture towards older days with the elaborate, whimsical title sequence. The title sequence became a whole deal unto itself in movies of the 60's & 70's (take, e.g., Saul Bass's great work in this area for Alfred Hitchcock), but has pretty much disappeared nowadays. It was nice to revisit this experience, with John Williams' playful score augmenting the visuals. An auspicious start.

DeCaprio's work here makes me revise my low expectations of him. He does a fine job here as the driven Frank Abagnale. Likewise for Tom Hanks as agent Handratty, my only complaint with whom is his phony Boston accent. The chemistry between the two is great.

The excellent script and Spielberg's direction keeps the movie going at a good clip and definitely keeps us on the edge of our seat as we see Frank artfully keep one step ahead of the dogged Handratty. The film is richly textured as well. It works as a suspense/intrigue movie, but also shows us Frank's complex motivations and confused family life. It also skillfully interweaves some delightful moments of ironic humor.

Mention must be made of Christopher Walken - a fine and underrated actor - who here does a superb job as Frank's well-meaning, but doomed-to-failure father. Walken does a great job of making us feel sympathy for this man who never seems quite able to get his life together, but whose intentions are always good.

On the whole, an excellent movie which takes us back to simpler days when moviemakers found fascinating stories about interesting people and told them as entertainingly as they could.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Much better than I thought it would be,43718,fugacity2000,28 June 2003,"I had passed by ""Catch Me If You Can"" a number of times at the video rental place before finally grabbing it this weekend. From the ads I had seen for it when it first came out, I figured it would be kind of shallow, boring, ""family"" entertainment. I stand humbled and corrected.

I have a new appreciation for DiCaprio as an actor now, although his performance isn't Oscar-worthy, it is pretty damn good. Tom Hanks is OK, although I still can't quite figure out (a) what that accent is he's using (Boston?) and (b) where is he stationed? That seemed the biggest continuity problem to me. At first he seems like he's in New York or Washington, then maybe Atlanta, who knows? Minor point, however.

Spielberg does a great job telling this story and making you actually care about the characters; my only beef is that I think he could have explored Carl's family situation a little more. I can see why he didn't, however, and, frankly, it doesn't distract from the movie too much. I would give this a 10, but Spielberg must still pay penance for that horrendous ""A.I.""",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,8 on a scale of 10,43687,len-21,24 June 2003,"Not a classic, but interesting. I have to say I have never seen a movie based on a real life person whose entire life was a con. So, it was original, and therefore, a worthwhile 2 hours of my time.

I thought DiCaprio and Hanks were both good. Hanks is ALWAYS good. The only downside was the lack of interaction between them. Of course, there likely was little, if any, interaction between them in real life, but all movies based on a good guy and a bad guy are enhanced by the ""relationship"" between them.

Otherwise, no complaints, just simple entertainment.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Sly and Winning Change of Pace for Spielberg,43748,secragt,21 June 2003,"Fleeing the dark tone which has permeated his movies for the past five or more years, Spielberg chose this light-hearted character piece from the mile high stack of scripts available and what a great choice it was. This is easily the most entertaining and purely enjoyable effort from Steven in at least a decade and a real comeback for a director whose work, while still respectable, was beginning to wear.

All the elements are there. The cast is outstanding from Hanks to DiCaprio to Sheen to Walken and they are all game. The script is sensational; from dialogue to organization of events this is probably the most focused and sly screenplays Spielberg has had to work with in many years and was probably the best script of the year. The music and cinematography are solid (one of Williams' better ""jazzy"" soundtracks.

In particular, DiCaprio shines as the fresh-faced con artist and Hanks is dependable as the long-suffering and dedicated federal agent after him. Walken makes the most of his limited screen time. One wishes Walken's character (and the genesis of DiCaprio's con mentality) had been better defined but there is the great substitute teacher scene which is transcendent and hilarious. Just the mere proud smirk on Walken's face when he realizes his son has pulled a fast one on the faculty for a week is enough to explain much of Abignale's childhood and influences.

Ironically, this movie relies on close personal relationships and almost no action, which makes it the most atypical Spielberg movie ever. There are no big chases or explosions but a great many heart to heart conversations. Incredibly, it all comes together and the result is a staggeringly witty and great movie. To be honest, I didn't think Spielberg had it in him anymore. But then, he had a lot of great help. Fans of cons and coming of age movies should definitely check this out. Hanks is his reliable self and DiCaprio steals some scenes and is entirely convincing in a challenging role. Give it a try!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,It caught me!,43748,berkerj,18 June 2003,"Believe it or not, Leonardo DiCaprio has acted well in the past. ""This Boy's Life"" and ""Basketball Diaries"" come to mind. He couldn't miss with this kind of material. It's one of those ""how could you not like this?"" kind of movies. Such a unique story is perfect fodder for a movie. People are gullible. How many firms really pore over college transcripts and check out all those references in depth? Charm gets you quite far in this life because as much as ability counts, an employer also wants to know, ""Am I going to be able to stand this guy for eight hours a day?""

Here's basically a slimy little kid named Frank Abagnale fooling everyone, essentially stealing millions of dollars, pretending to be some really high-level occupations (pilot, doctor, lawyer, teacher) and what happens? The viewer actually finds himself rooting for him. That's a combination of Steven Spielberg's directorial expertise and Leo's fine work with the script.

At least the Oscar folks remembered Christopher Walken by nominating him for best-supporting actor, though Chris Cooper got the statue for ""Adaptation."" Too bad. As usual, Walken takes over the screen every time he's featured, and the performance as DiCaprio's dad was Oscar-worthy. Tom Hanks was good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, though it sounded as if he received New England accent lessons from Kevin Costner in ""13 Days."" In other words, ""ugh!""

Terrific film. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. It was the best I saw in 2002.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,One of Spielberg and Hanks' best!!,43718,redbirds525,17 June 2003,"First off, I must preface by saying I am not a fan of Leonardo DeCaprio. I had to suffer through him in TITANIC (a movie which I enjoyed), GANGS OF NEW YORK (which I hated) and now CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.

I first saw CATCH ME IF YOU CAN in the theatre last Christmas and thought it was an okay movie. Nothing spectacular. I rented the DVD when it first came out and watched it three times within the week that I had the DVD for. This has since become one of my favorite films in recent memory. I have been turned off recently by some bad Speilberg films, in my opinion (AI, MINORITY REPORT.) But the combination of Speilberg, Tom Hanks and even Leonardo made this a very entertaining movie to watch.

This movie actually reminded me of THE FUGITIVE, with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. It always seemed the crook was one step ahead of the authority figure. Tom Hanks is great as Carl Handratty, the FBI agent hot on the trail of Frank Abagnale (DeCaprio.) The always wonderful Christopher Walken plays Frank's dad and gives a brilliant performance well worthy of the Oscar nomination.

This is really a great movie to see. One of my favorite parts was at the end where they are playing the classic Nat King Cole ""The Christmas Song"" during one of the climaxes. I would recommend CATCH ME IF YOU CAN to everyone, even those who are not Leonardo DeCaprio fans.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great but a little too long for it's own good.,43656,dumb2ugly,5 June 2003,"Fine comic caper that has a lot of heart, but over stays it's welcome with it's own sentimentality. Leonardo Dicaprio is fine as Frank W Abanale Jr, the young man who manages to become every thing from a lawyer to a pilot in his quest of fun, and Tom Hanks is fine as well as The F.B.I agent dedicated in catching him. The movie easily captures the frizzy fun of movies of a forgotten by gone era, and gives a hype vibe to all the scenes it has. The only problem with it however is the fact that it takes way too long to come to any real conclusion. The story could have been much better if it thirty minutes were taken out of the film, but it's fine for what it is.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Entertaining and fast paced,43687,FilmOtaku,5 June 2003,"Catch Me If You Can, the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. is compelling from the stylish opening credits to the very satisfying ending. I'll be honest, I have a love/hate relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio  I want to hate the guy, but once in awhile he comes out with a performance like the one in this film and I have to admit that he really is a good actor. He convincingly portrays Abagnale, a teen who managed to outrun the FBI for years - all the while writing over 4 million dollars in bad checks, posing as an airline co-pilot, a physician and an attorney. Throughout the film, he is pursued by Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks with whom he develops an interesting relationship. While I admit to enjoying Spielberg's action and effects-driven films, I also enjoy the smaller pictures he produces as well. This film is a prime example. I completely forgot this was a Spielberg picture, something I consider to be a great compliment. When a director doesn't have a defining style, it shows an immense amount of talent, and more importantly, lacks the predictability that we see all too often in Hollywood today, especially in the case of someone with such a storied and lengthy repertoire as Spielberg. Granted, Spielberg had the good fortune to have an excellent script and three fantastic actors (DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken) to work with, but the direction is practically flawless in that there are no slow moments; everything happens for a reason and is integral to the progression of the plot. It goes without saying that a film that is close to two and a half hours in length can have lulls, or seem to be too long, but I found that I did not consider the length once while viewing it.

Perhaps I've become so jaded after seeing so many movies, but I find that more often than not that I go into a film thinking that it isn't going to be as good as I had heard or expected. Once again, I've thankfully proven myself wrong with this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Slick Slight-of-Hand,43687,gipper1,1 June 2003,"Steven Spielberg says that his initial impression of the massive con job pulled by Frank Abagnale, Jr. was that it was all one big ""slight-of-hand"" trick - no substance, no profound evil, just somebody wanting to see how fast and how loose they can play with the system.

So Spielberg does about the only appropriate thing in bringing Abagnale's story to the screen: his movie itself is an artsy, slick slight-of-hand trick. It is as full of rich color, extensive detail, and beautiful decorum as anything Spielberg has ever done. I don't know if the movie is supposed to be ""about"" anything, even accounting for the obvious scenes where Spielberg tries to hash out his strange ideas of fatherhood. He has skipped his really relevant issues in favor of a shooting-the-breeze approach - encapsulated by the fact that shooting wrapped in only 52 days, manic speed for a Spielberg picture (this is the man almost run out of Hollywood for his monumental delays of ""Jaws"").

The film, in and of itself, exists just fine as this elegant piece of pop art which Spielberg has constructed, not dissimilar to the boys with toys attitude Steven Soderbergh brought to his ""Ocean's Eleven"" remake. Slinky, low-tech, with John Williams lyrical jazz ballet, it has vibrance, texture, and intelligence, with Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks stand- outs in their respective roles. DiCaprio is still a hard pill to swallow, but he comes off as at least a believably suave con man, if not a convincing one.

I suppose my one real critique would be length - the film has such pride and joy about its own carefree attitude that it is a shame to see it ramble to the end of its 142 minutes, with an interesting but unnecessary epilogue about how Frank Abagnale emerged from his life of crime to help the FBI start catching forgers not as smart as he was. A more concise display of how Abagnale moved on once the chase was over might have been in order, but that is hardly a deal-breaker.

3 1/2 stars (out of 4)",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Treat from Spielberg,43718,gbheron,1 June 2003,"The plot is so preposterous it has to be true. A young man, a teenager actually, drops out of high school and, not satisfied with low-end jobs, variously impersonates an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer. All his impersonations work, and he uses his personas in various forgery schemes that net him millions of dollars that fuel his high-flying international life-style. The young man, Frank Abagnail, is played with breezy confidence by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is wonderfully believable and his portrayal of the young con man is one of his best roles.

But it's not all entirely fun and games. The relationship between Frank and his parents, especially his dearly beloved but down-on-his luck father (Christopher Walken) is sad and multi-layered. The third important personal dimension is between Frank and the FBI agent (Tom Hanks) who pursues him.

Set in the early 60s, Spielberg nails the period perfectly from the opening credits through the clothing styles, modes of entertainment and transportation, and even personal accoutrements. It's perfection. After a string of darker pictures it's heartening to see Spielberg take on this project. It's paid off very well for his fans and the movie going public.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg's Honky Tonk,43656,Donolog,26 May 2003,"Catch Me If You Can is the latest Steven Spielberg film starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. I quite enjoyed it. It was very entertaining, and I always am more satisfied with movies when they are based, at least in part, on something that really happened. In reviewing Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven, Roger Ebert wrote:

Serious pianists sometimes pound out a little honky-tonk, just for fun. That's like what Steven Soderbergh is doing in ""Ocean's Eleven.""

I kind of feel like that's a bit of what Spielberg is doing here. I've found this the least thematically significant film he's directed since Jurassic Park, but that said it is very entertaining and the acting is excellent. Even DiCaprio, whom I don't normally like, was great. Even more so, I thought Christopher Walken's performance as DiCaprio's father was superb, and very much worthy of a supporting actor Oscar nomination he garnered for the role.

Bottom line: 7/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Great Movie,43687,huggy_bear,17 May 2003,"What a great flick. Another Spielberg classic, as well as Tom Hanks. It is unreal that this is a true story, of how a 17 year old kid could pull something off of this magnitude. It is kind of hard to believe that one person could fool so many people, but I guess that shows that perception is 95% of the solution. Put on a uniform, surround yourself with gorgeous women, and you too could fool the FBI? Great movie. Don't pass this one up.

Don't blame me... maybe it was the whole ""[...]king of the world"" thing. What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and Catch Me are great Leo movies. The two BEST he has EVER done. He acts well and the lines don't sound forced like in Titanic. Definitely see this one. This guy, who the movie was about, was a genius. Either that or very crafty. Rent this today!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Superb film making,43718,Charlie_Kane,8 May 2003,"This picture was recently released to DVD and I must say that the transfer is excellent. The film loses nothing in the translation to the small screen because its main strengths are its superior direction and acting. Leo DiCaprio not only appears in nearly every scene, but he carries this film with amazing, amusing and seemingly effortless panache. He portrays Frank Abignale, a 17 year old youth who, in 1963, managed to flit across the country impersonating, variously, A Pan Am pilot, a Pediatrician, and a lawyer. He also succeeded in passing over 1 million dollars in forged checks, all the while eluding the F.B.I. man dedicating to catching him, a man named Carl Hanratty, played by the ever amazing Tom Hanks. It's a rare pleasure to watch these two top notch actors play off of each other, aided by a nuanced, witty, and intelligent script. Not to be forgotten (except by the Academy)is the fine supporting performances from Christopher Walken as Frank Abignale Sr.,Amy Adams, and the luscious, amazing cameo by Jennifer Garner as the high priced hooker who gets beaten at her own game in one of the funniest scenes that I've seen in a long time. Mixing this all together in one fine dessert is the direction of Steven Spielberg. The style of this picture marks a total departure for him, allowing him to pace this film like no other. It's an excursion that I'm glad he took. Kudos also to D.P Janus Kaminsky and a totally mesmerising jazz influenced score from John Williams.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Cool, sexy and funky entertainment! Yeah!!!",43687,EijnarAmadeus,8 May 2003,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN Leonardo Di Caprio - Tom Hanks - Christopher Walken - Martin Sheen

Steven Spielberg's latest motion picture CATCH ME IF YOU CAN was a huge blockbuster in the cinemas and is truly a movie I urge you to buy on DVD / VHS when it appears in the stores. Leonardo DiCaprio shows for the second time in a small time (Gangs of NY) that he's a real good actor and together with just as good Tom Hanks in the role as FBI - detective this movie is just so entertaining and cool as it possibly gets!!

STORY: Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life falls apart when his dad and mom divorces. He runs out on the life and fakes everyone and everything. He soon pretends to be a pilot, doctor and lawyer in a short time with excellent skill and charm that every girl would like to see in the opposite sex. He flirts the girl down, impresses the men and goes threw everything with enermous beauty, but on the very start he got FBi - detective Carl on his back. Who's determed to find this guy and put him down...

The true story about a real fake scores pointes, I promise! The music composed by John Williams is superb, the acting is perfect, the directing is smoothly well, the mood is fabulous and the script is very good, yeah - a movie that will be remembered for a long time! STARS: **** 4/5 (closely to a five, yeah, actually!)",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Excessive,43656,Blade_Le_Flambeur,5 May 2003,"There appear to be two Steven Speilbergs in Cinema: Speilberg the filmaker, responsible for such films as Schindler's list and Speilberg the entertainer, responsible for films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Sometimes, he manages to balance out both with films such as Jaws as the result. I usually enjoy his more balanced out films, they really entertain while catching your deep thoughts. However, sometimes there's a sign of a clash between the two. In 2001's A.I. Speilberg seemed to want to have a Kubrick film yet at the same time dazzle the audience with vibrant chase sequences and harrowing visual effects. The clash usually ends up in somewhat of a mess, not neccessarly bad but not really that good either. That being said, I'll move onto the review. Catch Me if You Can is definitely a clash of Speilberg. He wants to provide the viewer with a quick and stlyish movie about one of the moust astounding criminals in the world yet also provide them with a deep, rich character study. Unfortunately, the script seems to go more with the quick aspect, providing flashy dialouge such as in Frank's Father, Christopher Walk's character. What ends up happening is a rather solid film, but it could have been a bit more. Leornado Dicaprio shines as the intelligent yet somewhat misguided Frank. He conveys his emotional moments and his excited moments effortlessly, really making the viewer think he's 17. Tom Hanks provides solid work here, but he seems to be a bit over- the- top with his character. Christopher Walken offers valuable support here, perhaps showing the route of the motivations for Frank's crime spree. With a good enough cast, this movie clicks instantly and follows through... almost till the end. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line the movie trips on it's own legs and becomes quite repeating. It ends up just being one con job aftr another, trying to inspire excitment in the viewer then get emotions out of them by showing Frank's internal dilemna. The script is solid enough and Speilberg's directing a bit unfocused but still all right. That being said, it's not that Catch Me If You Can is neccessarily a bad movie, quite the contrary really. It's an interesting $9 spent, a sort of ride yet an emotional experience. Speilberg clashes indeed, but the rest of the movie sticks together well enough. 7.5/10",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Greatest movie EVER!,43718,kyleh08,27 April 2003,"This movie has a great deal of character that everyone would love. Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio are great together.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great Movie,43687,kgsmith1,26 April 2003,"It takes a lot for me to recommend spending $7.50 on a movie, but I really do think Catch Me if You Can is worth it. Based on an amazing true story, I had just as much fun witnessing the many tricks DiCaprio's character used to get around the government as I did the movie itself.

I've never had a big problem with DiCaprio, nor have I liked him. I will say that he did a very good job in this movie, however. His work as both the arrogant and the fearful child was very good, and Tom Hanks does his usual excellent job. You can't go wrong with this one.

CatchMeIfYouCan,An Amazing Story,43687,mwendel,25 December 2003,"This movie is an adaptation of the book written by Frank Abagnale Jr., at one time one of the top con artists/forgers in history. The film is a sharp intelligent chase between the FBI and Frank. Surrounded by excellent locations, dialogue, and an excellent John Williams soundtrack, you are mesmerized by the sheer confidence and extent to which Frank was capable of eluding the law and forging checks. At times, Frank seems more like an escape artist/magician than a criminal.

One thing the film doesn't truly address is whether or not the immense losses suffered by the banks, truly affected any individuals or business in a long term manner. What it does show is how one step in the wrong direction can create a snowball effect that doesn't allow one to escape even when they want out. Frank, while living the life of luxury, somewhere along the line realizes that to live that life while being chased isn't going to work.

Luckily, for him, he was very young when he made his mistakes, and being very intelligent he acquired and retained skill set invaluable to law enforcement agencies and security companies today. Frank was able to turn his mistakes into a good thing in the end. I would guess, and one would hope, that if he had to do it over again, he probably wouldn't have made the same choices.

A very well done worthy of watching. Enjoy it!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Really entertaining!,43718,Roman0,15 April 2003,"This is a typical Hollywood entertaining movie! I couldn't help crying ""genius"" as I watched the movie. Yes, they produce the movie to fulfill dreams of people that can never be realized in real life. Of course the story can't be totally true: the plot that Frank escaped airplane by screwing off a few screws, truely interesting, but later with careful thinking, a normal human being can't just screw that off from top advanced instruments such as airplanes. Despite that, it's a wonderful Hollywood dream!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch this one!,43687,crazedvampyress,9 April 2003,"Not a huge fan of ""based on real life"" movies I saw this with some doubts in my mind. Many ""based on..."" movies come across with docu-drama feelings, plot holes due to time constraints, some shady comments that seem out of place unless you are already familiar with the real life events and various other unappealing material. Catch Me if You Can does *none* of this. The story of a young man with incredible talent who puts himself in unbelievable situations all searching for some kind of cosmic truth. This story could not have been written better if it was fiction, and the fact that it comes from a true story makes you really want to take a look at the people you pass on the street. It makes you think twice about the human race and leaves you feeling good.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Falsely categorized,43656,stamper,30 March 2003,"One thing that strikers me at IMDB is that the films there always carry so many genre titles. Catch me if you can is one of them. Virtually every category that was ever invented is listed, despite the fact that this is clearly what we (in Dutch) would call a speelfilm' or a spielfilm' in German. I do not know if there is a translation for it in genre' terms, but it roughly means motion picture'. You see this is just the story of a young fraud with not too much adventure, thrills or drama in it although featuring a lot of crime.

I think that after this film, there will be a time of quiet surrounding Steven Spielberg, because it is the way he's done it previously. Hook (1991), Jurassic Park (1993) and Schindler's List (1993), then taking a 4 year break from making movies; Amistad (1997), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), then taking a 3 year break and now AI (2001), Minority Report (2002) and Catch me if you Can (2002) making a ??? year break I presume. Why do I make this list you wonder well, I do it to make a point. The point is, that I think that Spielberg will take a bit of a break now and that I think he needs one, because the last films he has made weren't really good. I mean you obviously cannot keep making Schindler's List's or Jurassic Park's but there is something missing lately in Spielberg's work. I miss that feeling that I'm watching the films of someone who never stopped being a small child and I miss the feeling. I mean let's face it, in AI Spielberg tried to insert that dreamy side of himself, but it failed because the Spielberg ending did not fit the Kubrick story, then there came Minority Report which proved that Spielberg is not the best in making thrilling crime movies and now there is Catch me if you Can a film that has a pretty nice story, but also a film that is neither good nor bad. It is entertainment, in it's most normal form and nothing one would assume to have been made by Spielberg. It's not as if I'm not happy with the choices that he makes, but I feel that he could bring more feeling into his film. One could have felt more involved, the film could have been more dramatic and more moving. What happened Mr.Williams' great scores (I know he got an Oscar nomination, but I cannot remember one bit of film, where the music stuck out). This film is just not Spielberg's territory and it shows, for it is not as outstanding and memorable as his other work. Spielberg's territories clearly are adventure (JP, Indiana), Drama (Color Purple, Amistad, Schindler's List) and Family films (Hook, E.T.) and maybe he could even pull off dark film like AI if he didn't try to convert it in a fairy tale at the end.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Fun and entertaining! ***Potential Spoiler***,43748,paulywanna,22 March 2003,"Catch Me If You Can is truly an entertaining film. The 60's style of the adds to the integrity and intrigue of the picture. The film is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) a teenager still in high-school who pulls a number stunts and gets away with millions. With the F.B.I. hot on his tail, it is thrilling to watch over and again how Abagnale is able to escape their reach and play with them as long as he can. We as the viewers, tend to side with this desperate teenager and enjoy the taste of another sweet victory each time he gets away with a job. It is interesting to see DiCaprio take on the faces and prestige of doctors, lawyers, and teachers alike. All in the span of 2 and a half hours. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, agent of the F.B.I. and is a superb compliment to DiCaprio. Hanks always has an aura about him of high regard, and this film is another example of that expectation. The film was captivating from start to finish and has an ironic ending of which is a superb close to the story.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Funny and strange,43656,Taifuun,22 March 2003,"I really think that this movie was strange. The mood was somehow really tense in the background, all though I did laugh a lot during it, I felt a bit drained afterwards. The father-son relationship was the holding force in the movie, without it the movie would have been pretty meaningless. I gave the movie 8 stars though, it was entertaining enough.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg pulls it off,43687,McHuevo,22 March 2003,"Steven Spielberg shows why he is the most important director in Hollywood. Not just anybody takes over a project with ""Trash"" written all over it, and makes a very good movie out of it.

""Catch me if you can"" is a very enjoyable film that you can watch over and over again. I believe I'm one of the few that thinks Leonardo Dicaprio can be a good actor when he puts his mind to it. And although this is not the case, I must say that this is one of the few movies in which I don't find him annoying. Tom Hanks also proves his quality with an excellent performance in a supporting role, although it never felt right Hanks doing a goofy second to Dicaprio. Another great addition was Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr. He doesn't have as much screen time as Dicaprio or Hanks, but makes a strong background character that helps the audience understand Dicaprio's character.

I think the film's biggest plus is being a real-life story. I don't know how much of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life has been changed for the script, but no matter how different it is, the story is believable, except for making Dicaprio a 17 year-old, c'mon!. I think somebody hit the jackpot when they looked at Abagnale's adventures and said ""Hey, somebody should make a movie about him"".

Spielberg made a great last minute save with this film. I just can't imagine it being a good movie with Gandolfini as Carl Harranty and Verbinsky directing it. Spielberg + Hanks can never fail. I'm just glad Dicaprio didn't ruin it for us all.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Campina Grande,43718,Emerenciano,18 March 2003,"This movie is better than I thought it would be. I saw this during carnival here in Brazil, since I don't like the party very much. It's great, and maybe it's all I can tell about this film, directed by Steven Spielberg and starred by three great actors: Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. There's no need to say their performances are fabulous.

The plot is really interesting. We never know what is gonna happen next, and that's something that gets our attention during the whole movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Best Spielberg in years,43718,Frogfisher,16 March 2003,"Now this isn't ""Schindler's List"" or ""Close Encounters of the third Kind"", fare from those legend movie, but it's the best movie Spielberg made since ""Savin Private Ryan"". Sad because is seems less Spielberg than other films, just like ""Minority Report"".

Leonardo is very convincing and this is his best performance yet.

His portrait is great and you could see him as that kind of charming fraud he plays. Hanks is less convincing than Leo, but it's still the great performance you'd expect from the best actor we have right now. As in ""The Road to Perdition"", it's a new character for Hanks, which in both movies probably led to the Oscar nomination of his co actors.

But Christopher Walken is the best, by fare the best performance i've seen him in. He has some sort of devilish greatness about him it's just great. And the scenes with Hanks shows a great portrait of a father, Hanks must have some magic effect on he's co-actors, cuz if Hanks isn't the best all others are.

The movie is great stylish, very 60s and very straight. There are funny moments in the movie, especially Agabnale's first prank/fraud.

But somehow the movie is a little too long, but leads up the best Spielberg ending since ""Schindler's List"".

I love spielberg movies and this is one of his five or six best, which is saying a lot.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great director doing what he does best,43687,jmcsween90,8 March 2003,"Although his ventures into sci-fi in recent years turned up interesting results, Steven Spielberg has in this movie returned to more conventional story telling and the end product is a mouth watering feast of cinematic thrills. The film is based on the true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage con artist and fraudster who becomes the youngest ever person to wind up on the FBIs most wanted list. Having seen his parents seemingly perfect marriage crumble following his father's troubles with the IRS, DiCaprio enters a self destructive fantasy world when he turns his attention to forging cheques and impersonating airline pilots. Soon the Feds become aware of his illegal activities and Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) picks up the scent.

In an effortless two hours and twenty minutes, Spielberg uses his considerable talents to weave an atmospheric and exciting tale of cat and mouse as DiCaprio always remains just one step ahead of the determined FBI agent pursuing him. Slowly the noose tightens around DiCaprio's neck, but not before he has a chance to defraud millions of dollars and successfully trick his way into a variety of jobs he was unqualified to do. As his increasingly sophisticated exploits land him in greater trouble, he finds himself further and further removed from reality and he is left with no one to trust and no where to go but to keep on running. With meaningful relationships destined to end in tears, he develops a deep rapport with the only person who has any understanding of him  his pursuer Tom Hanks.

Catch Me if you Can' confirms yet again that Spielberg has no peer when it comes to making purposeful popcorn entertainment. He can thrill and audience without ever sacrificing the twin pillars of strong scripting and good acting. DiCaprio excels as the charming con man, while Hanks' measured performance as the dogged FBI agent is an effortless turn that once again reconfirms his status as one of Hollywood's most capable leading men. In the midst of the battle of the big names, special mention must go to the great Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father who steals every scene from the big boys. An exuberant jazz score from John Williams and a sumptuous production design that captures all the design flair of the period adds icing to this most enticing of cinematic cakes.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Brilliant acts in a somewhat jaded perspective of Spielberg.,43718,shanfloyd,7 March 2003,"In these days of breath-taking special effects, dazzling sounds and tension-filled interpretation of violent thrill, it's quite hard for a director like Spielberg to check the interest to make uses of them in his movie while he has a number of award-winning films filled with all of them under his belt. But it evidently appeared, after watching the film, that he really wanted to do something new. Something that deliberately will not be considered as a typical Spielberg film.

But he has not quite succeeded to fulfill those wishes. Though he has not used anything special of modern technology, apart from excellent camera work, another typical Spielberg perspective is now exposed which he could not remove from this film too. Well, upto this time that was playfully hidden by the tension his movie used to have. But now, the ""cat and mouse"" theory, in which the mouse is always the public winner (look at the examples, Jon Anderton, Ian Malcolm et al, the arachnophobics, the family in Poultergeist etc) is at its over-used bluntness while now, the 'cat' has come into the standard of FBI agents.

But above all these, it must be said that Spielberg is quite lucky to have so much brilliant actors at their best in this film. Be it DiCaprio, who is all convincing as young and handsome Frank Abagnale Jr. or Tom Hanks as the FBI agent. Both, especially Hanks, got it all right in every places in the movie. And we must not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. His performance is also quite realistic and fluent. So it turns out to be the acting which prompts us to see the movie over and over again, this time not by Spielberg, though smelling something new in the future air.",pos

After a slow first 30 minutes, the film kicks into high gear as we follow the cat and mouse game between DiCaprio and Hanks. Excellent 60s set pieces, costume design and an excellent, sometimes moody 60s soundtrack make what is already a brilliantly told story even better!

This is the kind of film that perfects the reason why we go to the cinema - to escape from ordinary life. Why can't all films be this entertaining.....?

CatchMeIfYouCan,A HIGHLY ENJOYABLE MOVIE,43687,matija-trost,19 February 2003,"Thanks to the fact, that it was made by a truth story.

The story itself is simply superb, maybe a little too light-weighted to become a masterpiece. Spielberg & Hanks did their's job as we expected from them, while a pleasent surprise came from DiCaprio, who managed to get rid of the Titanic-look-a-like style and gain some acting abilities. But the best performance came from supporting actor Christoper Walken. An Oscar play.

Catch me if you can is one of the best movies in 2002 and if it wouldn't be a little slow paced at the end, it would sure win the title - a classic movie.

Spielberg does a fine job crafting this smart and true tale from the opening title scene, even throughout the spotty ending (I wish I could have seen the rest of the cut...even if it took 3 hours....I'm sure they'll be some Special Edition DVD out in the future). DiCaprio's character was well done, although at times I thought a bit young for the role he was portraying. Walken was genuine, truly deserving of the Academy nod. Hanks was believable as Hanratty, but not really a change up for him in terms of roles. The scene at Miami International signifies both the high water point and downfall of this, although I found some of the finale in the FBI interesting I'd like to know what happened when he escaped and was caught in Europe.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Light-Hearted, Classy and Fun",43687,ststemp2000,17 February 2003,"This is a nice change of pace from Spielberg's brooding movies of late. Although the DiCaprio's character has no shortage of dark issues to deal with, he spends most of the film enjoying everything sixties America has to offer, and we're along for the ride. The film is fast-paced and clever. I'd compare it to the recent remake of The Thomas Crown Affair.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Another top class offering from Steve!,43718,supertom-3,17 February 2003,"Another fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. While I think this is not quite as good as Minority Report, it is more light hearted and simplistic entertainment, a film you can really watch anytime.

As with all Spielberg films, his storytelling is wonderful as is his cast. In this film, amongst others, we have Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. This makes for great watching, and the story itself is amazing, because it sounds so implausible yet it happened in real life. Frank Abagnale Jr went around the whole of the USA and parts of Europe conning people and cashing in millions in fraudulant cheques. The material on paper looks like it would have difficulty sustaining a two and a half hour movie but truth be told there are no such troubles, with Spielberg behind camera and the grade A cast all on top form it's simply engrossing and movie making magic.

Overall this rates as probably the best film so far of 2003. Its not quite a classic but still is a great piece of entertainment. ****",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A great movie with a good rythm,43718,lord_KRISHNA,17 February 2003,"This is a movie that made me really leave the theater in a good mood. The characters are very well drawn, particularly Frank, which is very suited for Leonardo, with all his versatile talent. There are some moments in the movie that really funny and the rythm of the movie makes the two hours pass in a no-time. The music is quite good as well.

All in all, the movie depicts how two persons apparently playing cat and mouse with each other can end up as the biggest of allies and also how a frightened kid can do the most outstanding things just to get by, live his fantasies, and try to bring his parents back together in the meantime.

A great movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,good light hearted fun,43687,tazmaniac80,16 February 2003,"Don't expect too much from this movie - it doesn't have loads to offer. However it is a perfectly enjoyable film, with great performances from the gorgeous Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks. It might be a little longer than it should be, but it doesn't drag. There are some brilliant supporting acts, particularly from Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. I loved the opening credits and thought the musical score by John Williams was original and snappy. Watch this for some good light hearted fun, but not for special effects or fight scenes.

CatchMeIfYouCan,The Real Pretender,43687,DamRho,15 February 2003,"For those who don't know the story behind Frank William Abagnale Jr I promise I won't disclose any information that can ruin your experience watching the movie. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was the greatest con in the history of the US. He decieved 12 countries and all 50 american states while running from an FBI team led by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). And guess what? He did this all before he was 19.Frank was probably one of the most gifted persons in American history - even though he used his gift for breaking the law - and it was only fair that he was portraied by a gifted actor. Leo DiCaprio gets into Frank's skin perfectly with, probably, the best performance in his career. Tom Hanks is the same great actor as usual and they both make a very funny and interesting duo throughout the film. The story is always interesting and keeps the viewer attached to the end. Of course, the directing is flawless by Steven Spielberg. He returns to the subjects that started his career - the broken home - and achieves one of the best films I've ever seen. A quick special mention has to be given to the author of the opening generic - sorry for not remembering his name. He achieves a masterpiece with an animation short film. An overall superb film. Don't miss it.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Can we reward Spielberg with `Chicago's' Oscar for releasing two purely entertaining films in the same year?,43748,yaseminturkish,14 February 2003,"Remind me again why America has such lofty expectations of Steven Spielberg but will gladly sit through any of the now rotten George Lucas films? Our expectations are so high that Spielberg goes out and makes his most purely entertaining film in a long time (`Catch Me If You Can') and one of his absolute best intellectual films ever (`Minority Report') in the same year but finds the Academy rooting for the sophomoric `Chicago.' Truly perplexing.

Possible Spoilers

That said, `Catch Me If You Can' is the most fun I've had at the cinema in years and like most Spielberg films appeals to everyone so as to maximize profit. `Everyone' refers to the dumbed-down American public who adore retread sequels, franchise films, and any film with the words Julia Roberts. And this is the brilliance of Spielberg who brings the masses of dumbed-down Americans together with the silent minority of intelligent film-goers who won't see a movie with less than 3 stars. `Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect film for everyone and so entertaining that I found myself more excited than I had been earlier that day at a screening of the self-indulgent `Adaptation.'

Who knew that Leonardo DiCaprio could act? I sure didn't after the snorefest that was `Titanic' but Spielberg has a way of urging even the most awful actor toward brilliance. As Frank Abagnale Jr. Dicaprio is very good at making us like this con-man and indeed, hoping that he will get away with all of his crimes. Tom Hanks is fairly pedestrian here, perhaps he's out of revelations, but Christopher Walken is pure magic as always. In one scene he and Frank Jr. make eye contact and there is a secretive smile that they share as he congratulates his son on getting away with impersonating a French teacher. Scenes with Frank's future wife, a nurse, where she is more upset that he's not a Lutheran than anything else are pure magic. A chance meeting in Frank's hotel room with Detective Hanratty (Hanks) is smart and fun.

Most intriguing is the fact that Spielberg spent very little time shooting `Catch Me If You Can' and in the course of one year managed to release two incredibly memorable films. Sure `Catch Me If You Can' doesn't add anything to the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. but a story as exciting as his doesn't need any additions, its a true story after all. Still, I can't imagine any other director bringing as much to the film as Spielberg does with his fun John Williams beginning to the scenes at Miami International Airport with the flight attendants and their cute powder blue uniforms. This is one of the few directors that you can currently look to for originality and excitement. `E.T.' was based on a dream after all and I can't forget those spiders crawling across the floor in `Minority Report'. Even his biggest failure `Artificial Intelligence' was unique and well-crafted. The other directors out there are on a course of making bad sequels for profit and making toilet humor some sort of revelation. You have to hand it to Spielberg for taking an extra step.

CatchMeIfYouCan,An entertaining movie with more depht that seems in the first view,43687,Josh20,12 February 2003,"First of all,i think Spielberg is a great director of adventure movies.That's the best gift of many of his movies.This movie seems a simple entertaining flick but it show us how ET's director has grown.His obssesion with the family is here and also his best cualities as cinema autor(broken families,lonely child,sense of adventure.....).The movie is not great but is very good.I think this is one of the best biopics in recent american cinema,full of joy and ,surprise,drama.This film is also a magnificent portrait of the 60's ,the period of the Frank's swindle.The story of the young fake becomes in a great biography in Spielberg hands.Leonardo DiCaprio at last can be the great actor that always he was.His performance here is the most adecuate in every sense of the word.He's moving,charming,and plenty of life.This is his best performance since Gilbert Grape.Tom Hanks is good,although the show belongs to DiCaprio. Catch me if you can is an entertaining movie that give us more than it seems.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A different Walken,43656,bjoern-arnold,12 February 2003,"I don't want to comment much on the film which I liked. It is a very light drama/comedy that is fun for the moment. But nothing more than that. I think diCaprio gives a satisfying performance-the best his limited range allows. He's very charming and likeable. Hanks on the other hand, who even would get an Oscar nod for playing a dead body, is wasted. I have never been a fan of his acting (highly overrated) even though he had great movies (since he can choose from the best material, it's no wonder). The one who shines here is Christopher Walken, with the only touching performance in the entire movie. He provided the needed depth and delivered a character description nobody thought he would be able to do (after all his maniacs-roles). His Oscar-nomination in the supporting category is well deserved. I hope he will win after Ray Liotta (""Narc"") and Dennis Quaid (""Far from heaven"") got neglected by the academy. Anyway, go see the movie. It's a pleasant opportunity to kill 2 1/2 hours.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Good entertainment with a great DiCaprio,43687,Teewurstmann,11 February 2003,"8 out of 10 To cut it short: This is a really good movie worth watching. It is based on a true story, the story of Frank W. Abagnale (www.abagnale.com) You should visit his website and read his thoughts about the book and the movie. Of course things are dramatized, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. And just because most women love ""Leo"", it doesn't make him a bad actor, he's actually an outstanding artist.

DON'T MISS IT!

Minority Report is a science-fiction classic, and now he's made a chase-caper film that's almost as good in its own way. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an excellent performance (definitely better than in Titanic) and Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken are also great - as usual. This is a fun and entertaining movie, but it's not forgettable or mindless, as many fun films are.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Surprisingly good movie!!!,43656,lovepade,5 February 2003,"!!!CONTAINS ITZY BITZY MINOR SPOILERS!!!

This movie is good, no doubt about it! I especially loved the sixties feel, very neatly captured by Spielberg. Leonardo is Leonardo as we know him, doing what he does best. Hanks is perfectly cast, and I was surprised that his face didn't bother me once, as it usually does.

The story is intriguing and the tempo of the movie is high. Christopher Walken steals the picture with his exceptional performance.

The father-son theme of the movie actually works very well which is a rarity for this kind of film.

I would rate it 8/10, but (being a European) the depiction of the French police takes one point off the score. However the Music by Frank Williams, and the intro (which captures the spirit of both the film and the sixties) gives that point back.

One could argue that the film idealizes Abigales criminal career, and that the morale of the film is, that as long as you do something good, everything will work out for you  even if your special talent is crime. However, as this film is based on a true story, and since movies in my opinion are not supposed to lecture or mould the viewer, I stand by my 8/10 (even though the movie is not breathtaking, it's a tiny bit more than just professional work).",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch it!,43748,Lady-Janey,2 February 2003,"It is the 1960's when Frank Abagnale Jr runs away from his crumbling family and begins the life of a fraudster, inpersonating a pilot, doctor and lawyer, and cashing millons in bad cheques all around the world. All before he had even turned eighteen.

So begins a game of cat and mouse where the teenage Frank tries to stay one step ahead of the bumbling FBI Agent Carl Handratty who is trying to track him down. The escape scenes are a lot of fun, the father /son moments between Frank and his father are filled with heartwarming drama. But it is the relationship between Frank and Carl that is special. Right from the opening scene you know Frank is going to prison but you wonder how Carl will eventually catch him. And what a scene when it comes!

Walken is great as Frank Snr.

Hanks's Handratty is far from his best work, but that certainly does not mean he's bad. He's just not in Forest Gump mode.

DiCaprio steals the show after being eclipsed by Day Lewis in GONY. He is outstanding in the role of the supremely confident fraudster Frank on one hand, as well as the vunerable kid who justs wants his family back together. It's a shame that he will probably miss out on an Oscar nomination , because he hasn't been this good since What's eating Gilbert Grape? Definately worth the ten year wait.

9/10 - Great film - Based on the true story of the life of Frank Abagnale Jr, Catch me if you can is a treasure of a movie. The action moves at a pace, without seeming to move at all, and you are drawn in a moment from laughter to sadness and back again just as quickly. How refreshing to see a film that shows some originality! Thank you Mr Spielberg. Thank you Leonardo. You are both forgiven. (A.I, Minority Report, Titanic, The Beach....) More of the same PLEASE!!!",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can - one of the greatest films ever.,43748,AdiTheGame719,1 February 2003,"I saw this film a few days after it was put in theatres and it was inspiring.

All the parts were excited and some parts were hilarious.

In my opinion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the greatest film ever to be able to mix drama, comedy, chasing, love, and action successfully.

I love this film, it ranks #2 on my all-time favorites list. I highly recommend it.

I just bought the autobiography and Frank Abagnale and will read it soon. I want to buy the movie book, full with screenplay, stills, everything, but it is $32.95 and will save up for that.

This movie, however, showed me a mature actor who was capable of filling into a challenging role. Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio could carry the film by themselves as they each contributed excellent performances, but i was also impressed by the supporting cast. One of the best movies of the year, bar none.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Vacation time for serious actors,43687,metrik7,3 February 2003,"This movie was an absolute delight. It is lighthearted in tone (with a touch or two of darkness), breezily shot and acted, and painted in a kaleidoscope of '60s colors. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks get to retire their serious acting chops for a bit and seem to be truly enjoying their roles. The supporting cast is strong from top to bottom, especially Amy Adams as a clueless naif and a heartfelt turn by Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father. Concerning the story, the tale of Frank Abignale, jr. (DiCaprio) is as much a yarn about mankind's willingness to trust someone who says all the right things as it is a commentary on how confidence opens doors which, for you, should rightly remain shut. Spielberg, who has been producing heavy, ominous fare for the last decade or so (Schindler's List, Amistad, and Minority Report, just to name a few), puts a sense of magic and enjoyment into his movies that calls to mind earlier work like E.T.

One final note: it's also amazing to note that what Frank Abignale did could never be duplicated--because of Frank Abignale himself. You'll have to see the movie or read the book to understand exactly what I mean.",pos

The fact that it is a real story makes it all the more better, and the performances are just unbelievable. Leonardo DiCaprio had the hardest task of making a movie that surpassed his performance in ""Titanic"", I feel that his portrayal of Frank Abnagale does this. Tom Hanks is always a joy to watch onscreen and can just about pull of any character that is given to him.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"A good, old-fashioned movie!",43718,mmcgown,25 January 2003,"After my disappointment with Spielberg's recent efforts, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Just a nice, old-fashioned fifties-style movie about a little larceny. Even the opening credits, reminiscent of the Pink Panther animation, let you know that this movie is going to be different. I could have taken my mother and not been embarrassed--and that's pretty rare these days.

Although I might quibble a bit with some of the flashing forward and backward that makes the story a little confusing, this was an enjoyable film overall--nice cast, great score, good location filming, mostly accurate sixties period details. If you're not a self-appointed movie critic but like good movies for their own sake and aren't just looking to find fault, you can enjoy this story and leave the theater without feeling that you got taken.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Polished, highly entertaining - and cleverer than it seems",43687,Chris_Docker,30 January 2003,"Which of us hasn't dreamed of succeeding in lots of fabulously high-profile careers? Doctor? Lawyer? Airline Pilot? For the past generation, the role model of escapist high achievement was given full power in the shape of James Bond, an ordinary looking upper class Englishman that achieved the impossible through fantastic gadgets and penetrating responses to life-threatening situations. But in the present day, the believability of a Bond-like secret agent is wearing thin. Similarly, the vicarious glamour of Hollywood stars is no longer a panacea to the wish-fulfilment dreams of working class drudgery. Enter stage left, appealing to everyone's slightly less than moral urges, Mr Frank Abagnale Jnr. And just to reinforce how it was possible to fake being a pilot, doctor and public prosecutor, we are reliably informed that it is all based on a true story.

(Minor plot spoilers): A sudden victim of a broken home, the adolescent Frank Abagnale Jnr (Leonardo DiCaprio) hightails to New York, blagging a pilot's uniform to get a bit of respect, and brilliantly forging increasingly large cheques. He also fools the airlines. Tiring of parading and cocking his pilot hat to the infuriated airlines, he poses as a doctor, learning the lingo from the TV show Dr Kildare, before moving on to become an assistant public prosecutor. To evade escape, he recruits a bevy of eye-candy airline stewardesses', and leaves the country under the noses of dozens of FBI agents. Capture and prison sentences follow, but he gets off lightly and becomes a respected, megabucks-earning hero at the same time.

Leonardo DiCaprio has tackled this real-life spoof with a professionalism that helps to make the film one that will possibly spawn look-alikes. His attention to detail included face to face research with the real life Abagnale and, even if the part does not demand the range of acting talent that instantly cries `Oscar', the skill with which he has executed his role marks him out as a very polished actor. Likewise Christopher Walken (as Abagnale Snr) turns in a first class performance and brings a range of emotion to his part (the beleaguered father) that is rare in Walken characters. Tom Hanks' performance, as the befuddled FBI agent trying to chase low-life Abagnale Jnr (who is patently of much higher intelligence than his pursuer), has restored my confidence in him as a Grade A actor  especially after his rather wooden `Road to Perdition'. In the Director's chair, Spielberg has tackled something outside his usual stomping ground: Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted romp at heart, but delivered with such panache that it wins as an action thriller and psychological drama at the same time.

For all its apparently lightweight pretensions, Catch Me If You Can is a fine achievement in popular filmmaking.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,This had been on my list and I finally saw it,43687,stevetseitz,30 January 2003,"I don't know why I had delayed seeing this movie for so long. I'm a Spielberg fan so I would usually not hesitate. Maybe I wasn't so sure how Leonardo Dicaprio would handle this role. Maybe it was because a ton of other ""must-see"" movies were out at the same time. Well, I finally saw and I'm glad. I can report that Dicaprio did a great job and that all the reviews criticizing Tom Hanks' Boston accent were wrong. I'm not saying his accent was perfect, far from it, but Hanks needed that little something to keep the viewer from thinking ""Hey, that's Tom Hanks!"" Hanks gives an understated performance that made me think that he is a better actor than I gave him credit for. (I know, I know he has two Best Actor Oscars) His mannerisms and the accent were different enough to allow me to accept his character and suspend my disbelief. Even if the acting had been horrible, the direction, the credit sequence, the music, the cinematography and the art direction would have me recommending this film. There were times when the story was poignant and bitter-sweet and moments where I found myself grinning in the theater. Any piece of art that can evoke emotion is a success on some level. I suggest seeing it in the theater.",pos

My favorite scene has to be when DiCaprio and Hanks first meet in the Miami hotel room. This is one of DiCaprio's best, and also a touching performance from Christopher Walken. 7 out of 10.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch it. You Know You Can.,43748,JohnLennon1985,27 January 2003,"I am in no way a Leonardo DiCaprio fan. I don't like DiCaprio. His performances on Titanic and Romeo + Juliet were less than satisfactory. I saw this movie for three reasons: Hanks, Walken, Spielberg.

DiCaprio surprised me. His acting was actually quite believable. Even though he's a 30-year-old playing a high school student, He seemed to fit the part. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken did not surprise me. I knew they could act before I saw this movie.

The presentation lost this movie 2 points. It was presented as a comedy. Maybe I should have known that ""Comedy"" and ""True Story"" is a very unlikely combination. It had its funny moments, but Catch Me If You Can was actually pretty serious.

DiCaprio captures the part of the con-artist Frank Abagnale perfectly, in a very believable performance. He's 200 percent on the mark. Tom Hanks is good as the detective, maybe not 100 percent on target but still good. Christopher Walken is excellent as Abagnale's father.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Wonderful!,43748,tubasunshine,20 January 2003,"I am so surprised!! I just got back from seeing Catch Me, and I wasn't expecting much from it. I think this one has Oscar written all over it for Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and maybe even Steven Spielberg.

The storytelling and layout of the film was outstanding. To start with an easily recognizable game show (To Tell the Truth), and to take the movie as many places it did shows that Spielberg has not lost his touch. He needed to direct a winner after so many draws, and he did with this one. In the words of Frank Abagnale himself: ""You know why the Yankees always win the World Series? It's because of the pinstripes."" The pinstripes really wowwed me!

Oh, and I LOVED the soundtrack. This is one to bring home and listen to over and over again.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"One not to miss - that means you too, Oscar.",43718,Juliette-10,19 January 2003,"First of all I should probably declare my bias - I am definitely NOT a Speilberg fan. So when I heard the hoopla on this film - as yet another gem from the Speilberg stable I was sceptical. However, I did find two reasons to overcome my aversion to Steve and go anyway - the fact that it is based on a real-life person (hey, it might be educational) and secondly, that it signals the end of a two-year hiatus for DiCaprio. Okay, okay - I'm sure there are quite a few of you out there who base his entire career on Titanic - but for those of us who have seen a number of his smaller, 'indie' projects you'll know what I mean.

And, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Gone are the long build-ups that Speilberg favours. Out, too, goes all of the schmaltz he has tended to dollop onto his movies of late. And, probably best of all, he gives us a movie in which Tom Hanks doesn't cry (oh come on, name another one!). Instead we get a tightly-scripted foray into the world of grand larceny through the eyes of a 17-year old boy.

DiCaprio and Walken are both brilliant in their respective roles. Walken is both endearing and infuriating as the idealistic dreamer of a father who can't (or won't) understand why the IRS keep pursuing him for his taxes. DiCaprio, on the other hand, pulls off a double-whammy by being both enigmatic enough to be able to pull off the con-jobs while at the same time, never allowing you to forget that he is only a boy. DiCaprio's treatment of 'Frank' is neither condescending or trite - something many actors today could learn when playing teenagers.

However, that is not to say the movie is without its flaws. The first is Hanks. Often held up to be one of the greatest actors today, here he flounders against not only DiCaprio and Walken but against much of the supporting cast as well. He just doesn't seem to be able to find a rhythm for his character and instead seems to be trying a different tack in each scene.

The other flaw is that obsessive need of many American directors to bring psychological theory into their movies to increase the dramatic gravitas. We do not need to be told the reasons why 'Frank' embarked on his crime spree for two reasons: 1, DiCaprio has already done it for him through his sensitive, three-dimensional portrayal of 'Frank'; and 2, because the charm of this kind of movie ultimately resides in the fact that each of us find a certain appeal in 'Frank's' actions - both the audacity and the flair he shows in being able to pull off these heists. In saying all of that, this movie is one not to miss - and that means you too, Oscar. DiCaprio was robbed for What's Eating Gilbert Grape - don't let it happen again.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Ties With Two Towers As The 2nd Best Movie of 2002,43748,emfern13,25 January 2003,"I know there both very different but Catch Me If You Can needs to be ranked this high. It is richly entertaining and in its 140 minute running time, it doesn't get boring. Unlike Dicaprio's other movie Gangs of New York gets boring after awhile.

Also unlike in Gangs of New York Dicaprio gives an excellent performance in Catch Me If You Can and in Gangs he gives a terrible performance. It's really sad that Dicaprio will probably not be nominated for an oscar because this is by far his best performance. Theres just too much competition for him. Tom Hanks did a good job too but he wont be nominated either.

This movie has an excellent script, that should at least be nominated for an Oscar. So should the Original Score. The Costume Design and Art direction are possible too. Spielbergs Direction is a longshot for an oscar nomination but its not totally impossible. Best Picture is totally impossible though, sadly.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg in top form,43687,littleblackduck,24 January 2003,"In the 1960s a young man named Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Di Caprio) forged his way into a lifestyle that included designer clothing, girls and flying. His story is a fascinating study of how naïve the world was then and how easy it was for an intelligent man to convince people that he was genuine. Have times really changed? Steven Spielberg is still channelling Stanley Kubrick and he delivers a dark comedy, which moves at a frenetic pace underscored by a jazzy soundtrack. On the surface, this film looks fluffy and brainless but take a look at the way the director uses things we take for granted. There are numerous references to Christmas in this film and forget the jolly holiday  Christmas is presented as a dark and lonely time when bad things happen and loneliness digs its claws in. FBI Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) works on Christmas Eve and receives a call from a guilty Abagnale, a small Christmas tree one of the only sources of light in the room. Abagnale's discovery in France is at Christmas time while carollers sing pious songs. Abagnale is arrested outside his mother's new home; never getting to enjoy the Christmas treats inside. The world is presented according to Kubrick who believed that the world was a thoroughly unlikeable place and people cruel and self obsessed. This is one of the major themes in this film. Frank's father (an excellent Christopher Walken) is hounded by the IRS and abandoned by his French wife Paula (Nathalie Baye) and remains a broken shell of a man, still clinging to the sham that is the American Dream, never realising his full potential. His son runs away from all this pain, and running is an important motif in the film, and seeks solace through money. An ironic film reference to Forrest Gump (1994 ) involves a banknote floating in front of Tom Hanks reinforcing thematically that this race is for money, not fulfilment or spiritual comfort. Hanratty is just as obsessed as Abagnale and that the two should end up together is one of the film's strongest metaphors.

Spielberg does not show us the whole story. He cuts and jumps and never gives us the full picture  what is left out is just as intriguing as what is shown. There is resonance in the gaps and silences in the film and the symbols further enhance the ride. Lots of this film takes place in temporary accommodation such as hotels and rented apartments. Hotels being the symbol for transience and impermanence, the rooms are filled with trolleys of half eaten food, consumed alone, and the family home is broken up by debt early on in the film. Everyone in the film is eager for something greener  the young girls duped into becoming stewardesses, the naïve Brenda (Amy Adams) who is manipulated by parents and lovers alike and Hanratty himself, who is searching obsessively for his Holy Grail in the form of Abagnale. Hanratty never tries to understand Abagnale and even mispronounces his name. He is a loner who has no time for people only results.

The score by John Williams (unlike his usual stuff) enhances the film and there are some very clever credits, which reinforce the feel of the era. There are sloppy errors in the production design, which are annoying, but the look of the film is one of its biggest assets. Spielberg uses period camera angles and editing and the photography is a delight. Janusz Kaminski knows his way around a camera and uses it to tell a story, to characterise and to make subtle points. An example is when Frank Jr meets a young woman in a hotel corridor. The camera focuses on the shoes of each character. Shoes in themselves being sexual symbols gives the scene much more resonance that if it were conventionally filmed.

Spielberg has certainly grown up as a director. AI (2001) was a great film. That the general public didn't get its cynical take on humankind says a lot about how audiences see movies and how they are manipulated to accept the trite and the banal. Minority Report (2002) was a dark, brooding satisfying film and Catch Me If You Can while not as cerebral as the previous two, still does not fail to entertain and to please. This little black duck was very pleased thank you very much.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,What a team!,43687,darrell-garrison,19 January 2003,"Steven Spielberg has brought Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio together in what could have been a small film, but becomes great entertainment in the hands of these masters! One of my favorite things about this movie is something I didn't even notice until towards the end-- Spielberg adds his unique touches ('Spielbergian') without overwhelming the film. His restraint and professionalism truly shine here. Hanks is excellent as always, and DiCaprio continues to show his growth as a fine actor. It's only a matter of time before he wins his Oscar in the right vehicle (this isn't it). I saw 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me If You Can' within a week of each other. I would easily pay to see this film again, but not the other (even though 'Gangs' is quite good. And by the way, this film is much more re-watchable than Spielberg's other film this year, 'Minority Report'). This movie has a great 60's sheen to it. I hope it gets an Oscar nomination for Best Costume! The audience I was with enjoyed this bad-boy-on-the-run caper, rooting for him vociferously. And what makes it so special is that it's based on a true story. This film makes me want to read more about Abagnale. I recently saw an interview with him, and he stated that the movie correctly captured the essence of what his life was like then; that's as high a compliment as is needed. I had a feeling that the real Abagnale had a cameo somewhere, and I was right. In reading the credits he shows up as a French police officer! For the films that were released in 2002, there are only two that I can universally recommend to ANYONE. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', and this movie. 'Greek Wedding' would get a slightly more vigorous nod because of a bad swear word said by Hanks in this that might offend some; but it was the FUNNIEST line of the movie! This may win no Oscars, but it's GREAT entertainment! ***1/2",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Good acting, Great movie",43748,Anna_Lana,19 January 2003,"This was a wonderful movie, although some of the more adult scenes could be limited and the end was rather predictable. I saw it with some friends, who also enjoyed it quite a bit. Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job, boosting his image after such titles as The Beach... Tom Hanks was great as well. I can't wait to see it again once it is released on VHS or DVD. Somewhat long, but it feels like 3 smaller movies all rolled into one large package. Younger people may not understand most of what is going on, but the story is good nonetheless. Bits of humor are added to make it even more crowd-appealing. Overall, it was a very good movie, a good reenactment of the true story (at least from what I've heard), and it deserves some recognition.

CatchMeIfYouCan,I was absorbed,43748,pete443,18 January 2003,"My first and only criterion for enjoying a film is whether I'm absorbed. To the point where I don't think about time and think like the characters and consider them real. A fairly simple yet powerful measure.

This film abosorbed me. A fascinating plot, very good acting, and even though we know the ending, suspense. It helps not to know before exactly what fields the fake entered, just to add a little more. A plain, good ole entertaining movie in the best spirit of Hollywood. I suppose uppity types won't be impressed, since it lacks the weirdness so many critics seem to crave in ""critically acclaimed"" movies.

Bottom line: was the ticket worth it, was the time well spent? A resounding yes. Highly entertaining.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg did it again! What an entertaining film for all to enjoy!,43687,ruby_fff,21 January 2003,"There's so many film releases all at once that it's easy to (dis)miss Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can."" It is a breeze of a film - thoroughly enjoyable. Such entertaining drama with humor, suspense, family ties, FBI stories, based on true events from the life and times of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hollywood or not, it doesn't matter. C'est si bon.

Spielberg made it seem so easily done - right after the June release of ""Minority Report"". Just the opening credit sequence sets the tone of the film. Its animation is so cool that you'd know it's going to be fun. The ever prolific Maestro John Williams, a regular in Spielberg films, once again provided the accompanying tempo to the plot lines. Watching Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) and Tom Hanks (as FBI agent Carl Hanratty) interact is such a treat. The vintage Christopher Walken (after such a wonderful low key performance in ""The Opportunists"" 2000, again) gave an endearingly subtle portrayal as Frank Abagnale Sr. - how can Frank Jr. not do everything he can to regain the financial status to his Dad, and win Mom back? There lies the loving ties of father and son, but is it reciprocal or blind-sighted?

Besides being an 'innocent' con artist, Frank is quite skilful with graphic arts. Seeing him burnishing those PAN AM logos tack down reminds me of my graphic design days before Mac's and PCs - intently applying careful peeling, cut and paste techniques, burnishing those Pantone transfer types... The set production and art department really brought the 60's back to life. Cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and film editing by Michael Kahn - both are veterans in Spielberg films.

Behind all the cheeriness, there are bleak reality moments. After all, this is still life on earth. Lucky for Frank Jr., through all the cat and mouse hiding and chasing, agent Hanratty became almost like a surrogate father to him. Glad to see Nathalie Baye was chosen to play Frank's mother. She is one of my favorite French character actresses, since her role in Bertrand Tavernier's ""A Week's Vacation"" 1980, to her 1999 ""Venus Beaute Institut"" and ""An Affair of Love"" - always she delivers with such simple ease.

This film does remind me of ""Chameleon Street"" 1989 - Wendell B. Harris Jr. wrote the screenplay based on true events, directed and portrayed con man William Douglas Street (who took on a myriad number of roles than just 3). There's also Tony Curtis in ""The Great Impostor"" 1960, directed by Robert Mulligan.

Thanks to the genius of Spielberg for letting us enjoy a psychological suspense drama in a lively and fun mode. Everyone involved in the production probably had a marvelous time collaborating. The audience certainly did.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Good, but not great",43718,Jisk,20 January 2003,"While watching Spielberg's new film, I was completely captivated by the naturalness of the performances. Usually, I find the acting in his films to either be syrupy(A.I., Saving P.R) or cartoonish (but good as in Raiders). In this film, the performances felt REAL. I have never experienced that in a Spielberg film, as I have usually felt that the performers were too aware that they have been ""acting"". That is my most usual criticism of his films. This time, I had no problem with it. I loved the acting in this film.

My problem with this film lies with some of the choices Spileberg has made as a director. Spielberg is not notoriously ""stingy"" as a director. He usually lets the audience have what they came to his movie for: an emotional experience. While this trend was certainly true early on (think of the final segment of Close Encounters), lately it seems that he is holding back. I won't give away any spoilers, but people who read this might know what I mean. For instance, I walked away from this movie THINKING about it. Not FEELING it but THINKING it through. Did I like that or didn't I? I asked myself. I sure laughed like a loon throughout so surely I enjoyed it, but then why did I feel so dislocated from that experience of it by the end? Spielberg, in my own humble opinion, has been committing ""Shyamalanisms"" of late. Definition: A really alienating end to a perfectly wonderful movie; an ending that makes you ""think"" but ultimately does nothing to make you ""feel"". ""A.I"" did it. ""Wha?"" I asked at the ending of that film. Everyone seems to loathe the ending of ""Minority Report"" so I won't even go there. And now, with ""Catch"" he has completed a trilogy of films which are largely wonderful but leave you with a sense of vagueness/despair.

Don't get me wrong, I liked this film. But I wanted to love it. Spielberg wouldn't let me.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Groovy 60's fun from Spielberg,43718,Quirky-,19 January 2003,"***SPOILERS IN REVIEW***

A breezy, very enjoyable film from the title credits onwards, Steven Spielberg's latest, 'Catch Me If You Can' is not a particularly important film from the blockbuster man, but it's good, guilt-free fun for a couple of hours. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man, son of a stationery store owner and a mother from provincial France, whose life is suddenly torn apart when his apparently in love parents announce their imminent divorce. Young Abagnale panics at the very notion of his parents being apart and hot foots it down the streets of NYC. After this spontaneous running away, Frank Jr. must somehow make a livingwhich leads to the idea of forging bank cheques. This forgery doesn't go unnoticed by the FBI, where Special Agent Carl Hanratty (a bespectacled Tom Hanks) is on the case, desperate to track down the chameleonic Abagnale. After some credible impersonations of pilots, doctors, CIA agents and lawyers (and a few others), Abagnale has racked up almost $4 million and the FBI is close to tracking him down

At 140 minutes, the film feels a little too long, although the time doesn't drag with the proceedings. DiCaprio is excellent as Abagnale, Christopher Walken is tragically funny as Frank, Sr. and Hanks is good as the always-on-the-job, Hanratty. As I said, it's not a particularly significant film in Spielberg's career, but it's a lot of fun.

8.5/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Note to self: Make a lot of fake checks, buy James Bond suit, work for FBI.",43718,Anonymous_Maxine,18 January 2003,"The latest film from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks is much more than a vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio, who is granted the most screen time by far, it is a massively entertaining film about the true life adventures (and I should think that the word adventures' should apply here in all possible meanings) of Frank Abagnale Jr., a brilliant young man who's con artist abilities are revealed in a thrilling early scene where he impersonates a substitute teacher, going so far as to turn away the real substitute when she shows up to teach class.

We are not shown how he is caught after committing this relatively small-time offense, because the last thing we want in our minds about this character is how he gets caught at something. Instead, we see his parents sitting in the principal's office, where the principal reveals to them that their son has been teaching class for the last week, assigning homework, having parent/teacher conferences, and was even planning a field trip. His mother is furious, as most mothers would be, being, I think, the real rulers of the house, while his father was proud of his son's sneakiness as, I also think, many fathers would be (except for the uptight ones, of course). I know MY father would have loved it if I managed something like that in high school.

(spoilers) It seems that Frank has a brilliant mind that he applies to not the mot legal avenues, and his home life is less than wonderful. He comes home one day to discover his mother having an affair with one of his father's friends, and when he eventually finds out, instead of writing a name on that little form to choose which parent he wanted to live with, he jumps out the window and runs away, beginning the adventure that we learn about during the rest of the movie. Granted, Catch Me If You Can is one of those films where the plot from beginning to end is revealed in the preview (kind of like Pleasantville), but it is still a thrilling ride, which is a testament to the talent involved with it.

One of the most interesting elements of the movie is the way it is structured. It knows that it is a predictable film, not only because it starts at the end but because it is a true story and true stories that end tragically are not made into movies (at least not by Spielberg), so the chronology is mixed up at several points during the film. We start at the end, go back to the beginning for a while, go back to just before the end, a little past the end, back to the middle, etc. Not necessarily in that order, but the way the chronological order of events is skewed in the film makes it refreshing even if we already know what it going to happen.

The only problem that I had with the movie was that, despite its ending, there were several things about the movie that were just too convenient. As only a single example, there is a scene late in the film when Frank is being transported back home from France to go to prison in America, and after finding out that his father fell down the stairs and died, he runs into the bathroom, escapes from the plane Commando-style in broad daylight, and runs on foot all the way back to his house. I realize that the movie takes place before cell-phones and even in the early days of two way radios, but you would think that it would not take the FBI the ENTIRE DAY to get to his house, the most obvious place that he was headed. In real life, there would have been squad cars waiting for him long before he jogged back, which makes me wonder how this particular detail played out in real life, if it did at all.

Either way, it is clear that this scene is, as they say, dramatized for effect, which makes you wonder how much of the rest of the story is as well. There is also one other scene that sticks out for this reason like a bright red flag. About two thirds of the way through the film, virtually the entire staff of the FBI are at the Miami airport, because this is the only airport that Abagnale will use (the only reason given for this, by the way, is because this is the airport where Hanratty, the agent assigned to capture Abagnale, has set up his stake-out). They are looking everywhere for Abagnale to show up, and after his girlfriend sets him up, he goes to local universities signing up a whole crew of flight attendants for a two-month flight attendant training tour throughout Europe.

We are never told how he managed to get PanAm to let these fraudulent attendants on the plane when they show up at the airport, or where their uniforms came from, or whether they were all on the same flight or PanAm was nice enough to spread them throughout their entire airline corporation, but the gimmick is that Abagnale is able to walk through the entire airport surrounded by gorgeous young women, and all the police officers and FBI agents their to capture him would be so distracted by all the hotties that they wouldn't even notice him.

So here's problem #1: Abagnale is going for the art of invisibility, and there are few things less invisible than a lot of beautiful young women wearing matching pink uniforms. Very few things, in fact, would attract MORE attention to his little group of followers. Problem #2: If you see a whole group of beautiful young women wearing matching pink uniforms walking in a grinning little group with only a single male within the group, that male attracts at least as much attention as the women. Meaning, if you see that many women walking and giggling together and they are only with a single man, not many people wouldn't be scrambling to see who that man is. In both cases, Abagnale might as well hold up a blinking sign with his name on it.

Of course, as with many other scenes within the movie that are just entirely too convenient, Hanratty is on the phone and facing away just as Abagnale walks by with his big pink group of buddies, but has the brilliant foresight to have a look-alike waiting outside with a big sign with Hanratty's name on it, another little detail more than likely added to the story for our amusement in the film version. Like I said, a lot of this stuff is not very likely to have happened, at least not exactly as we see it in the movie, in real life, but it's also not entirely without effect and not entirely unappreciated.

Spielberg is America's most popular director, and in this movie he proves that he knows how to present a chase. A good chase film has to be structured with a series of close calls and more comfortable moments. You remember this in The Fugitive, for example, when Richard Kimble is cornered by Sam Gerard in the tunnel on the dam, only to escape by jumping off right in front of him. There is a wonderful scene in Catch Me If You Can where Hanratty finds Abagnale's hotel room and bursts in with a gun, at which point we are sure there's no escape, but Frank manages to impersonate a CIA officer right in front of Hanratty, an agent for the FBI, and narrowly escapes, to the audience's great delight. Again, not exactly the most believable stuff in the world, but it sure is fun.

Leonardo DiCaprio has made a tremendous leap both in his choice of roles to play and in his acting skills as a whole. He has certainly come a long way from his chokingly awful performance in Titanic, to play a role in Catch Me If You Can that he seems born to play. The only problem with him in this role is that he is a 28-year-old actor who happens to be able to pass for a 16-year-old kid, when what the part needs is a 16-year-old actor who can, when necessary, pass for a 28-year-old man. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, is absolutely flawless in his role as the driven FBI agent determined to capture Abagnale, even if he asks him nicely to leave him alone. And I don't want to hear any complaints about Hanks' accent, because he captured it beautifully. If you really want to whine and moan about a well-known actor doing a fake accent, watch Thirteen Days.

Overall, Catch Me If You Can has some flaws, it has a few scenes that go beyond the expected suspension of disbelief, but these scenes seem to have just been too ambitious in a movie that maybe was turning out even better than expected. In that sense, these scenes are little more than a slight excursion over the top, while the movie as a whole shines and entertains, even for the slightly lengthy running time. It was a sad and moving scene when Frank's father's death was revealed, and his mother strangely disappeared in the movie into the oblivion of her marriage to her father's friend (the one she had been having the affair with), but as a whole the movie is wonderful entertainment for the whole family.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Enjoyable film!,43718,jjh6519,18 January 2003,"I had a lot of fun watching this movie! Leonardo DiCaprio was given the role of a lifetime -- he is perfect for the role of a teenager who can pass for an adult, and he makes the most of it. Teaming him with Christopher Walken as his father was a stroke of genius, as the two really resemble one another, something that never would have occurred to me. Both of them are great, and Tom Hanks has fun with his role, too.

(I find it interesting that the Hanks role was offered first to James Gandolfini, but he had to turn it down due to his commitments to ""The Sopranos"". I can imagine what a great comic turn Gandolfini would have had with this role as the perplexed, straight-laced FBI agent.)

And Steven Spielberg, who inherited this film from other directors, took it and made it into a truly enjoyable experience. It is probably the lightest, funniest Spielberg movie ever.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,One Good Movie,43687,ManOrAstroMan,16 January 2003,"What makes this movie as compelling as it is must be that it's based on a true story. Otherwise, it would just be fiction about some fictional liar...man, was it intelligent. You can see irony, voice, wit and sarcasm splashed throughout this gem of a film. It kept everyone in the theatre entertained, young and old alike. I'm 17 and I thought it was brilliant. This is because the story, at its roots, is the realization of every brief, passing dream of wealth, notoriety and grandeur we have ever had.

That is all we want, all that Frank wanted: the notoriety.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Fun little character study,43687,BadWebDiver,16 January 2003,"This is a fun little story with three great performances. When I heard about the plot, I instantly thought of an old Tony Curtis movie THE GREAT IMPOSTOR, which is one of my all-time favorites. While this one doesn't quite have the timing or panache of that old gem, it holds up on its own terms surprizingly well.

<Possible spoiler warning!> The best thing about this film is the way two pro actors like Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are used in juxtaposition to each other. I thought the combination worked very well. It was also good fun to watch Leo go from a gawky high-school teen to a ""wise beyond his years"" slobbish 20-yo(!). Some of Leo's scenes are a bit too posturing (like the printing press scene), but I thought the story played smoothly most of the way through. And Christopher Walken gave a nice understated performance as the old Dad, which seems to be his stock-in-trade character nowadays.

Certainly a great film to watch, which tries to catch some of the panache of the old comic classics; and almost succeeds.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent!,43718,Rob6137,12 January 2003,"What a great film! There is such a harmonious balance of dramatic and cinematic elements achieved in this film, something I haven't seen in awhile. The acting is superb! Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Walken are wonderful. The plot is intriguing and had me to the very end. The characters are very well developed and are presented in a very authentic and real fashion. The visuals are absolutely astounding and the editing and direction are outstanding. The film is never slow or pretentious and is stays true to what it is. The motifs of the film and its style and tone are displayed wonderfully throughout. John Williams has not written such a fine score in years and Spielberg is once again at the top! Five stars! A Real Winner!

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Interesting, entertaining... but a little bit too long.",43687,mathlepine,14 January 2003,"Leonardo is excellent as Frank Jr and so are Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. The plot is great for a true story in the sense that you don't always know what is going to happen next, there are some surprises. It was one of the first time that a beautiful lady played by a famous actress wasn't in the action of the movie. In fact, there is none. Yes, there are many ladies, but they have little screen time and they aren't famous. So, it was a fresh aspect here for a Leonardo movie that I liked. The plot is entertaining because you're asking yourself when he'll get caught. (if you know that he gets caught) The way he fools everyone is also very funny to watch.

The dates were a little bit confusing but it wasn't very important. Sometimes, some scenes are boring and you want to get to the action. At the end, you hope that it end because it's a long movie, but it's worth it.

It is not the best movie that I've seen. Live some people pointed out, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, it wasn't dramatic enough to be a drama. It was something unusual that could have been god, but I think that Spielberg didn't spend too much time on this movie. So it gives us a good movie... close to even be very good...

CatchMeIfYouCan,Absolutely Charming,43748,Nixiy,8 January 2003,"I was in no hurry to see this. Oh, it looked entertaining enough when I first saw the trailor, and I heard many an excellent review. But even though I do enjoy movies of this genre, it's not my genre, if you will. Even so, when I was invited to go see it, I was happy.

And I was not disappointed. This really is one of the best movies out right now. The story is fast-paced, wity, and thorough, while the acting is superb. Tom Hanks was as good as ever, but I was pleasantly surprised by the dashing performance Leonardo DiCaprio gave. I never was a fan, but this film proved me wrong.

I'm sure Spielburg grabbed that artistic license and ran a marathon with the Frank Abaganale story, but the result is a funny, exciting, sweet, and thoroughly charming tale.

CatchMeIfYouCan,OSCAR FOR WALKEN,43718,wallystein,7 January 2003,"Good film. Great cast. Someone should finally give Walken an Oscar for this performance!! DiCaprio blows away his alter-ego ""Gangs of New York"" performance. This is a fun film that plays more like a character study than an action/suspense flick - and I the one am happier for it!

CatchMeIfYouCan,The Moose Hole - 'Catch' This 'If You Can',43687,JAKastner,12 January 2003,"There are few directors out there that can make a great film but it is even rarer for a director to make two great films in one year. Steven Spielberg will try to be one of those rare directors. Earlier this year, Spielberg directed the critically praised Minority Report, which gathered more praise for its box office battle with Disney's Lilo & Stitch then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg attempts to breathe new box office life into the career of Leonardo DiCaprio by adding the mix of Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will this experiment work and showcase the reasons why Spielberg is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood or will this one of the very few flaws in his career?

The story goes that Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents but things begin to change very quickly. His family moves to a small apartment after his father runs into trouble with the IRS. Frankie's parents soon divorce after his mother begins to cheat on her husband. This drives the confused boy to run away from home. Frank makes a good life for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot becoming the James Bond of the skies. But he runs from that job after an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty begins the chase to capture him. Hanratty will go to the ends of the earth just to catch him. The story, which was based on a true story, was well done but felt too weighted. Some of the elements seemed too unbelievable for the audience to really accept. And some areas of the story seemed to last too long that in the end they felt flat for the most part.

The characters in the film were all based on real life people. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr. It really wasn't much of a stretch for him to play a ladies' man but it had been some time since he played a character that was like the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused character who continues the chase not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty to fill that void he is missing with his family. DiCaprio shows great acting ability especially in the end expressing this character. Agent Hanratty is not an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but it is a character which seems like he had a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is great as Frank Abagnale Sr. playing off Leonardo DiCaprio very well especially in facial expressions. It is a shame that his character is not given a good send off in the film rather then the plain ending his character gets.

Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly not one of his greatest. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic films offered by Spielberg but Catch Me really seems slow and flat in certain areas of the film. Some of the characters were flat in some areas. Christopher Walken's character is great but sent off in a good way. At least there should have been something there for the audience for feel sorry for when his son is told his father is dead. Jennifer Garner's character, though nicely performed by the Alias star, seemed pointless in the overall effect of the film. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can. If not, don't worry too much about it.

My Rating: **** out of 5",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Lost Boys come of age,43718,E Canuck,11 January 2003,"Don't believe I've ever seen a Stephen Spielberg, before this one, that was NOT branded with his particular mass-appeal style. At some point in his films, I usually feel poked in the ribs--okay, here's the punch-line from your All-American Boy, I-Love-The-Movies Director. His direction in Catch Me is coherent and strong without being intrusive, putting the story first.

Not that I want to start on a negative note. Catch Me is a really good film--funny, human--and different, for Hollywood, which usually likes its young male heroes to be hip, horny and heartless. Frank has a disarming vulnerability and attachment to his family. That lost-boy thread saves his story from being about someone who uses people, and it makes the movie.

Fine acting from Di Caprio and Walken. Even the opening credits are first-rate--clever and entertaining, but leading the viewer to the credits, rather than distracting from them.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Good solid performances by all-well written,43687,boomlarry,4 January 2003,"Good solid performances by all- DeCaprio managed to be believable as a high school student and still made the transformation to jaded fugitive...This was a great story by the way and don't think this couldn't happen today. Hanks was perfect as always even as a foil. I've met FBI agents like him- and they are still out there...

I did not look at my watch once during this picture, it is so much fun, especially with the ""60's"" background. Spielberg captures this era in all its innocence...and the viewer is never bored.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Amazingly well done film,43687,snowboarding_or_sex,4 January 2003,"What can I say? My friend dragged me to go and see this movie and I honestly didn't think it looked that great - but being the nice, easy going friend that I am, of course, I went. This movie was really quite unique and not at all what I expected. The acting is really great from both DiCaprio (who I really haven't found to be such a great actor in the past) and Hanks (go figure). Do me a favour and go see this movie; odds are, you'll really enjoy it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Decent fluff,43656,hellbert,4 January 2003,"This is one the FEW films in which DiCaprio was decently casted. I did not believe him as a street thief in Gangs of New York for a second, but he pulls the con as Frank Abagnale rather well, considering the fact all he had to do for a third of the movie is smile and look pretty. Christopher Walken - God I love him - looked like he was reading cue cards for part of this film, but he played the frailty of Frank's dad damn well. Tom Hanks was probably the better of the three, as the FBI agent chasing Frank but his role seemed almost for comic relief. The scene stealer here I thought, was John Williams' pseudojazz score. The music reminded me of those 60s cop shows, but with a quick tempo to remind us that this is, after all, a chase movie. With bright washed out lights, the cinematography lent a dream like quality to the atmosphere, but in reality served to tell us that this is just Hollywood fluff.

CatchMeIfYouCan,What's not to like?,43687,sincitybrant,7 January 2003,"When I saw the trailer for Catch Me If You Can, I was hooked. I like movies about con-men, deception, and the line between fantasy and reality. To me, Catch Me If You Can was a positive family-friendly Talented Mr. Ripley. The movie doesn't sparkle and it really has no flash to it, for which, I'm quite grateful. It is a solid well-produced movie in the tradition of Quiz Show, that left me wondering how much of the story was true. Hanks and DiCaprio stepped aside from any normal scene-stealing and let the story capture the audience's fascination and like many others, I'd agree that Walken was on top of his game. I recommend this to anyone who wants to entertain his or her family or in-laws.

We go at least once a week to the Movies to escape our everyday lives. This was another great adventure. It did start a bit slow but was well worth the time we spent on our New Years' Day ""date"". The mixture of humor and seriousness was enjoyed by all in the theater. It was good to see Leo back after the last (The Beach) disapointment. Can't wait to catch ""Gangs"" this weekend.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent!,43748,bst112,1 January 2003,"Anyone who would find anything negative to say about this movie obviously fits into one of two categories:

a.) Has nothing better to do than find nasty things to say about films simply to be different, simply to have something ""bad"" to say about things (i.e., inanimate objects or media exploits) that have achieved a higher level of excellence than their overwhelmingly mediocre human existences ever could.

b.) Has absolutely no taste in films whatsoever. Is the kind of person that would truly enjoy watching ""Deep Blue Sea"" or ""Anaconda"" over and over again with great admiration for the film makers.

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of the most entertaining movie of the year,43687,yui1217,1 January 2003,"To me, to watch a movie is in seek of entertainment. Not trying to pursuing some profound, wonderful meaning in life (unless I'm watching some movies like the Truman Show, that's one of the very few movie that actually makes me think).

Catch Me is a movie that gives you a lot of entertainment. To me, this is enough. Movies are part of the entertainment industry, not a part of your lecture notes that you have to get tested on. Just watch this movie as an entertaining story, it's a pretty good film. Humorous, exciting, and a good plot line.

And of course, Tom Hanks did a great on portraying the somewhat dumb, upright, and persistent FBI agent Carl. Leonardo Dicaprio has done so far the best job on portraying a character in all his movies, the smart, cunning and somewhat flirtatious young thief Frank.

A very nice film afterall, not one of the best in history, but one of the best in the year.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Spielberg does comedy, and succeeds!",43748,Brogan,1 January 2003,"I've recently got a ""A"" in one of my college classes titled, ""Spielberg/Lucas."" In that class the instructor lecture on the style of visual, characters, and plot for a Spielberg film. We made ""connections"" with all of Spielberg's films, what did JAWS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and SCHINDLER'S LIST all have in common? With Spielberg's latest film, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is this the same Spielberg that is famous around the world?

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very different Spielberg film. It's a off beat comedy with a bit of suspense mixed into it. Critics and fans have been criticize Spielberg for the last twenty years for his attempt for doing a comedy film which was 1941. Now, Spielberg has managed to succeed in making a enjoyable comedy film. Where 1941 had tons of slapstick comedy and buildings falling apart in the name of laughs, CATCH ME is more from personality and wit. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). Frank is known to be the most successful con-artist and check forger in U.S. history. Abagnale posed as a Pan-Am air pilot, doctor, and proscutor, when he didn't even complete high school. Abagnale also went around the world making and cashing about $4 million dollars with bogus checks. Despite that the checks would bounce like a rubber ball, Frank had enough intelligence to fool the banks and even the the companines he claimed he worked for. It took federal agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) to identify Frank's mistakes, which led Carl on a cross country pursuit for Frank. While Carl is staying around the clock trying to figure out more about Frank and his whereabouts, Frank keeps changing his name, occupation, and girlfriend. The only two people that remain close to Frank's life is Carl Hanratty, and Frank's father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken). The film shows that one of the reasons why Frank remains to do his numerous crimes is to purchse expenisve things for his divorced father who is depressed from having his wife leave him on her request, and the closing of his family owned stationary store (where Frank learned about his numerous tricks of forgery). When I heard about CATCH ME being the new Spielberg film, I bought a copy of the book written in first person by the real Frank Abagnale. I highly enjoyed the book with the way Abagnale explains on what he did, how he did it, and the numerous funny parts that would be great to be put on film. After watching the movie, I was slightly disappointed in the film. There were some parts in Abagnale's book that I was looking so much forward to be seeing in the movie, including a part in the book where Abagnale gets involved with bailbonds man. Sadly to my disappointment, it wasn't featured in the film. I then read a interview on why Spielberg was so attached to direct CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and when you watch the movie, it's obviously shown on the screen. Spielberg loved the father/son relationship between Frank Sr. and Jr. In fact, the relationship was partially mention in the book, in the film, it's carried thoughout the film. While the movie does touches on the various career changes and check forgery. Also, since the book was written in first person, the character of Carl Hanratty was mention here in there, where Hanratty is the second most seen character in the film, right behind Frank. But other than that, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. I've always been devoted to Mr. Spielberg, and this is a very different film for him. It is historical, takes place in the past, but it's the first time where most of the film is being told from one character's narrative. Spielberg does a great job with telling the story, he even adds a nice touch of the mid 60's film style and mood with the opening credits being animated, very similar to the opening credits of dozens of 60's comedies. Then John Williams also adds the final touch with the jazzy score that is heavy on the clarinet and brass than the usual strings. Most people groan and moan when they hear the name Leonardo DiCaprio, ""oh no! Not that guy!"" I do agree DiCaprio does get overexposure, but he is a good actor. Look at WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and THIS BOYS LIFE, he did a excellent job in both films. I think most people just think of DiCaprio in TITANIC which wasn't his fault as much as it was James Cameron's. DiCaprio might win over some people with his performance in this film which shows that DiCaprio did understand the personality and that Frank had a fun time while doing all of the check swindeling. Christoper Walken breaks out of his stereotyped acting that many comedians and t.v. shows have made fun of in the past, and delivers a very good performance. Just watch the scene when he talks to Frank Jr. about his still love and devotion to the woman that left him for another man. But Tom Hanks is the pro, and he proves it again in this film. Hanks portrayal of Hanratty with the Boston accent and the combination of the clumsy actions yet intelligent mind makes the Hanratty character the most enjoyable federal agent since Tommy Lee Jones Sam Gerrad in THE FUGITIVE. Hanks did a brilliant job with Michael Sullivan in ROAD TO PERDITION, and he does it again with Carl Hanratty in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. I can not judge if CATCH ME IF YOU CAN should get any Oscar nominations (I haven't seen GANGS OF NEW YORK, ADAPTATION, and CHICAGO yet). But from what I've seen, CATCH ME is great, but it's not better than TWO TOWERS, MINORITY REPORT, SOLARIS, ROAD TO PERDITION, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, and PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. If there should be any nominations, then Hanks should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Hanratty.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable film, it's a big risk of a film for Spielberg to return to comedy. But this film proves that Spielberg can now do any genre, including comedy, and pull it off. Great job Mr. Spielberg! ***** (out of five)",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Realistic painting of a fantastic life,43718,friendtalk_2000,31 December 2002,"Is this movie a feel-good comedy with a message or a character-driven drama in lighthearted sheep's clothing? Well, it's both. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it appreciates and celebrates the fact that real life does not fall into genre categories, but spreads into all of them, binding them together with the common thread of the person who's living it - in cinematic terms, the main character. And boy, does Leonardo DiCaprio deliver in that department. Obviously intelligent and creative, his Frank Abagnale, Jr. is carefree, mischievous, and always aware of the fact that he will, eventually, be caught - he's just trying to enjoy the ride as much as possible before it ends. DiCaprio shows us the sparkling glee when Abagnale pulls off a con, the innocent ego that makes him absolutely believe that he won't be caught. then the grief that propels him onward, and a desperate loneliness that ultimately drives him to reach out to the FBI agent on his trail (played by Tom Hanks, who's been doing this for long enough that his character is automatically solid and enjoyable, even though he's technically the `bad guy'). Their tenuous and unusual relationship is one of the most interesting aspects of this fascinating movie - made all the more fascinating by the fact that it's all based on a true story. Real life is stranger than fiction, they say, and Frank Abagnale's life is one so impossible you just might believe it. He got away with an absurd amount of fraud and deception in a picturesque, naïve era, and Catch Me If You Can follows his adventures with the delight of a director who truly enjoys the story he's telling.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Walken is amazing,43687,Rory2000,6 January 2003,"This movie is a good change for Speilberg, because unlike his last two movies it is actually good. Not just parts, or up until a moment when he screws it up; Catch Me... is enjoyable all the way through. What really makes the film is Christopher Walken. He has given many great performances, but he really steals the movie. Envoking so much humanity into his character...wow! He's going to get an Oscar nominaton and maybe this year the judges aren't smoking crack and he'll win.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Busy but successful,43748,KevinSmith13,30 December 2002,"At the beginning of Catch Me if you Can. I felt that there was too much going on for this film to be successful. I felt that there were too many time switches back and forth and that maybe Spielberg had ruined a perfectly good movie trying to make it a Spielberg movie. However, fifteen minutes into the movie I became totally amazed. Great acting by DiCaprio, this part is an actors dream, however he plays it very childlike, and very believably(Amazing considering Leonardo is 28 and his character at one point is 17). Tom Hanks is very good. I was thinking on the way home that maybe a ""cooler"" actor could have played Carl (Hanks character) such as George Clooney. However I realized that Carl makes too many mistakes to be ""cool"" so Hanks fits the part. Christopher Walken does a great job. My vote 9/10. A great movie to spend an afternoon at the theater. If you don't agree with me, ""Knock Knock"" (You will get that after you see the flick, and hopefully you will laugh)

I am now! Leo was just great! He was everything: he was smart, funny, cool and slick. I don't think they could have picked anyone better to play his part.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Best Picture 2002,43748,JB-45,29 December 2002,"The executive producers - Tony Romano and Michelle Shane deserve not only the Oscar for Best Picture but a Congressional Medal Of Honor for bringing a REAL MOTION PICTURE back to the theaters of the world. That said; `Catch Me If You Can' has got to be one of the most thoroughly entertaining feature films since, `Moonstruck.'

Hats off to Steven Speilberg for absolutely fabulous direction. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves the Oscar and Golden Globe for an unbelievably great performance as young Frank Abingnale - Tom Hanks was, as always, truly convincing as FBI agent, Carl Hanratty - Christopher Walken as Dicaprio's father was a truly mesmerizing performance. I fell in love with Nathalie Byer. The entire cast, it seems, is on the same page - the chemistry is at once believable and heart wrenching.

Jeff Nathanson screenplay is a beauty. I expect we'll see a lot more from Jeff.

From the opening titles to the costumes to the closing shots this movie was refreshingly original and riveting. Catch Me If You Can, is a throwback to movies of yesteryear that we movie buffs hold dear to our hearts.

Thank you very much for making this movie.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Leo and Hanks are remarkable,43687,FilmWiz,5 January 2003,"MPAA Rating: PG-13

My Rating: 12 and up

My * rating: 8.5

When I first learned about the making of this film, I nearly fainted. Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in one movie together? That combo didn't click too well with me, but I decided to see it in the opening week, anyway.

Boy was I wrong... The film was remarkable, and everything about it was realistic and exiting, which is just the thing you'd expect from a Speilberg picture. This is one film that I would enjoy seeing time and time again, and it's creators should rejoice. Even Frank Abagnale Jr. should be happy about the release of this picture.

The story begins when Frank William Abagnale gives his son, Frank William Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) a check book for his sixteenth birthday. Following his fathers footsteps, he become a con artist. He uses his checks as a way to spend money that he doesn't have. At the same time, he uses his skills to become a doctor, a pilot and a lawyer. Carl Hanratty (Hanks) is an FBI agent who trys to catch him. the real shocker is in the end...

This story is superbly told by all actors, especially the two leading actors, DiCaprio in particular. DiCaprio is not the 'Titanic' spoiled teenager that he was in most of his films. He is now a 19 year old adult, something I have been wondering about now for some time, even though he was born in 1974.

An excellent film. You will not be dissappointed",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,"No matter who you find yourself rooting for, this is fun ride",43687,SinjinSB,4 January 2003,"Fun. That's the best way to describe this story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), if that is his name. Steven Spielberg brings us a second good movie this year (Minority Report being the other). Based on a true story, this movie takes us on a non-stop journey of a teenage who is conning his way around the world posing as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. This goes on for years, as he is able to stay just ahead of FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Christopher Walken also turns in a good performance as Frank Abagnale Sr. All of the supporting cast performed also performed well. No matter who you find yourself rooting for, this is fun ride.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Best movie I've seen in a while!,43748,jasons_the_man_2000,4 January 2003,"First of all, I must say that I was very impressed by the acting of Leonardo Dicaprio. I have been unimpressed to put it nicely by his acting in some of his other movies. He did a splendid job and I commend him for it. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and his character really made the movie great. He is just such a great actor, and he can add this to his list of terrific performances. I also liked Christopher Walken as the Mr. Abignale Sr. I really think he is a great guy and a really funny performer and he gave this movie a lot of side character. I know this movie will be a big hit as it should be, and I am just amazed that this movie is based on true events. To think that a teenage boy could do so much harm in such a short time. Good job to one of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg. Without him, we would not have nearly as many great movies on my shelf at home, and when this on comes out on DVD, it will join them. A+ in my book.

CatchMeIfYouCan,An Amazing and Entertaining Film!!,43718,kippardue_luvr21,4 January 2003,"I loved this movie! It wasn't a typical Steven Spieldberg movie, which is what made it so great. It had excellent performances in it from Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, and Martin Sheen. This movie was so amazing and unreal that it seems impossible for it to be based on a true story, but surprisingly it is! I do think Leonardo deserves the Golden Globe nomination he got for this role, and possibly an Oscar, but I was surprised Tom Hanks did not get one because I thought he did an excellent job as well. I hope 'Catch Me If You Can' makes it to the Oscars!!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Simply Captivating...,43718,E-un,3 January 2003,"Even if the acting, the screenplay and direction weren't excellent, this movie has the unique advantage of being based on an incredible true story. In no way was anything dramatized; and in fact some incidents were absent from this retelling of Frank W. Abangale Junior's (adolescent) lifestory.

My only complaint about the movie is that it is slightly overlong (around 10 minutes - honestly!)

Once again, Tom Hanks demonstrates his subtle genius and DiCaprio does a convincing job. The first prize must go to Walken though, as his portrayal of a broken man is touching without being sappy.

All in all, a great movie that isn't spoiled by the usual Spielberg trappings.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Don't miss this one!!,43718,sbdts,2 January 2003,"This was a really entertaining and engrossing movie all the way through. At two hours and twenty minutes it seemed like an hour and a half. Walken and DiCaprio were excellent, and Hanks even better than that!! Good character development, no slow spots, and enough humor too. Very, very good. 8/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,What a funny film!,43748,emurray-2,2 January 2003,"This movie has good acting, a good story, and several good laughs. The laughs were unexpected and quite enjoyed by the audience and me. True stories are rarely as interesting or as funny as this one. Leonardo di Capprio shows once again his versatility and selectivity in choosing movies for their script and for furthering his career. Tom Hanks also plays the serious roles as well as the funny ones (e.g., Forrest Gump). This is one of the better films to come out in December, 2002.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Entertaining Drama/Comedy,43687,easmith03,2 January 2003,"I found the movie to be top notch entertainment. The acting was great, and the story was paced in a way that it didn't have any slow spots for me. There were enough laughs to make the movie seem quite light hearted. But, there was also a dramatic element of the movie where you realize that Frank (DiCaprio) is committing crimes, and he is being tracked down.

Frank leaves home as a 16 year old and begins a ""successful"" career as a con man who uses the cover of a pilot, lawer, doctor, etc to help him to a life of riches as he uses his counterfit identifications to help him pass bad checks. The FBI is always a step behind. Frank seems to be able to get away with anything, and seems quite the clever con man. But, you begin to realize that he is really just a very young man, who despite the adventures, is really quite lonely.

Yes, he is a criminal and you do have to kind of root for ""bad guy"" to get away to enjoy some of the drama in the movie. However, I don't think I'll be giving away too much to say that he does eventually have to pay for his crimes.

I had just finished the book just prior to seeing the movie. And I do think the movie captures the spirit of the book. However, I found a couple of things curious about the transformation to the screen. Apparently the book is embelished. Probably several things in the book are presented more ""grand"" than they actually occured, or just made up entirely. But, there were a couple of events in the book that might have been interesting in the move. While the movie also adds some elements that weren't in the book at all. Oh well, I enjoyed the book also, and it was a pretty easy read, so if you enjoyed the movie, you may want to consider reading the book also.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A very good picture,43656,artzau,2 January 2003,"Spielberg is a very eclectic director and film-maker. I get the impression, he loves to dabble, as it were. In any case, he is definitely a risk-taker. This film is a jewel in several ways. Strong performances by DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. I'm glad to little Lennie getting out of his cutsy-tootsy, post-Titanic over-self-adorational stage. He might eventually become an actor. There are several moments in this film when he gives an excellent performance without resorting to his whinny, spoiled teenager persona he's shown us in previous films. Hanks and Walken, as usual, are top pros and right on line. Walken's role is a poignant one as the unconscious enabling father, Frank Sr. and old Chris comes through in fine style. Hanks (and, no, you reviewers willing to slam him for his ""accent;"" he's right on with the New England dialect)is superb as the low-keyed, workaholic, driven FBI agent, Hanratty. The circumstances of Abagnale's life and adventures are incredible and I remember reading about him back in the late 60s when he was apprehended. This story-- his story-- is more of a statement on our American culture and how our commitment to excessive materialism can make fools of us all. All in all, this film, while like most of Steve's brain children, is a bit too long but very engaging. It is a delightful biopic with both hilarious and sad moments. I recommend it highly.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A great movie! Funny and touching.,43718,Kat_D,27 December 2002,"Catch Me If You Can is a great movie! Tom Hanks and Leonardo diCaprio are hilarious. This is a must see movie. It's funny, though there are some serious parts. It's hard to believe this movie is based on a real person. Some parts might not be appropriate for little kids, but I highly recommend this movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Dragnet meets The Fugitive,43656,ferguson-6,2 January 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness. Spielberg delivers a very entertaining romp through the life of Frank Abagnale,jr. I have not read the book yet, so am a little unsure what is fact and what is Hollywood, but it did seem strange that he was captured 3 times. Interesting performance by a New England accented Tom Hanks, who seems to be giving us his best Jack Webb impersonation. Leo is solid as the con on the run and was a nice selection with his natural charm. However, nowhere near as dynamic a performance as he gives in ""Gangs of New York"". Stealing every scene was Christopher Walken. Known mostly over the last 20 years for his goofing as frequent host of Saturday Night Live, Walken reminds of why he was thought to be a real up and comer in ""The Deer Hunter"". I got chills as Walken swells with pride in his son as he realizes Frank has the establishment on the run. Really thought many of the scenes with his fiance and her family were idealized and were there to show how Frank missed being part of a family unit. Again, I don't know the facts of the case, this is just a perception. Spielberg gets some nice supporting performances out of Mr. Barbra Streisand (James Brolin), Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner. Mostly this is an entertaining film that the masses will enjoy and there is nothing wrong with that.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Well-Told Story,43748,sumytra-2,27 December 2002,"This film was clearly not a star vehicle. It was three guys getting together creating a solid piece of work. Spielberg is a great storyteller. No loose ends. Everything is tied together neatly. Tom Hanks is a good actor making everybody else look good, too. Leonardo DiCaprio is still growing as an actor and this film catches him in that growth between teenage fame and adult power. Tom Hanks helps him with wisdom and Spielberg blends the two of them into respect. It's clear all three men respect each other's work. I do to. I smiled throughout the film. Thanks guys for a great matinee!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great story with wonderful acting,43718,golfcarter,27 December 2002,"Tom Hanks once again shows why he is the modern day Jimmy Stewart. There isn't a part he can't play, and he brings out the best in everyone around him. Unlike the Tom Cruise/Paul Newman hook-up in ""The Color of Money,"" I think that this movie will be the vehicle that launches Leonardo DiCaprio into a wider range of roles.

The delight of this show comes from its reality. The check fraud was a product of the times, when the world trusted most people to be honorable about bank checks. And the movie really captures your attention and allows you to empathize and imagine living the characters vicariously.

I highly recommend this movie...You will not be disappointed.

CatchMeIfYouCan,An Affecting Good Time Movie Experience,43748,StarCastle99,1 January 2003,"Who says Steven Spielberg can't make a movie without ""scope"". This is one fine movie going experience and a great yarn. Leo di Caprio gives an honest performance, but he can't hold a candle to Tom Hanks. Tom has a special appeal, which is why he's Tom Hanks. The most amazing thing about the film is that it is based on a true story. Thankfully, Christopher Walken supplies Leo with some interesting motivation for becoming ""The Great Pretender"". Earlier in his career, the knock on Spielberg was he was a director of spectacle; not an actor's director like Sydney Pollock. That just isn't the case. His abilities have matured, as has the man. This was an entertaining movie about an incredible character. Just the right fare for New Years Day!

CatchMeIfYouCan,"light, breezy, fun & inconsequential",43687,HBeachBabe,1 January 2003,"""Catch Me if You Can"" is as light and carefree as the period it evokes. Right from the opening title sequence, accompanied by yet another great John Williams score, we are transported to the early sixties - a decade of bright colors, breezy tunes and gentile living - the Camelot of pre-assassination-of-Kennedy America.

Steven Spielberg's flashier side is well hidden here, although his style comes through in his inventive use of close ups and cross cutting to give a sense of time and place, evoke the period through the use of small details rather than large settings.

His work with the actors and the small character touches is evident. Leonardo DiCaprio fares best under Spielberg's guidance, Tom Hanks, not as well, but still strong.His use of a New England accent seemed to impede some of his line readings.

The story is fun, with just enough depth to keep it from blowing away. Ultimately though, the material may be too light for Spielberg, often feeling *too* much like 5 or 6 episodes of a 60's TV sitcom, like ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"" or ""Gomer Pyle"" Hank's use of a four-letter expletive not-withstanding.

CMIYC is a fun time at the movies and will make you laugh and maybe get misty eyed, but it lacks the emotional pull of Spielburg's weightier films. Taken on it's own, it's an excellent film, but given the caliber of talent involved, I expected something more substantial.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,One of Dicaprio's finest movies!,43748,Streetwolf,1 January 2003,"Leonardo DiCaprio is one talented actor!

*Minor spoilers*

Summary: Frank jr. lives with his parents, but his father Frank Sr. is having problems with is store and the IRS are after him. Frank Jr. learns a lot from his father and in school one day he pretends to be a sub-teacher and gets caught after a week! At the same time, Frank's mother is having an affair and his parents then get a divorce and Frank runs away from home, but the cheques he has bounce all the time so he finds a way to make better cheques and changes his appearance from time to time to show what he does to cash the cheques. From a pilot to a doctor he uses the television to guide him in a way and soon an FBI agent catches on to Frank's trail, who now becomes a wanted fugitive.

I really enjoyed this movie, it kind of reminded me of one of my favourite tv-series The Pretender (Michael T. Weiss, Andrea Parker) and how there are some people in the world that can pretend to be anyone they want to be. Leo was great as Frank Jr. and I think its his mother Paula that is to blame for him running away, she was having the affair that killed the family and how his stolen fortune soon messes his mind up so badly that he loses prospective of everything. Tom Hanks was very smooth as the workaholic FBI agent. Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. who loves his son dearly and Frank John Hughes who starred in a series called Players where he and 2 others were forced to work for the FBI, what a coincidence that he plays an FBI agent in this and especially because the ending is somewhat the same as that series.

I rate this 10/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Kudos for Catch Me if You Can!,43748,delh1,1 January 2003,"Out of the several excellent films late in 2002, Spielberg's fabulous ""Catch Me if You Can"" is most certainly among the top

five, for superb direction, innovative filming, and of course, great acting by principals Tom Hanks and Leonardo DeCaprio (whom I was never particularly fond of until now).

The plot twists and turns keep the viewer perpetually interested. The surprises are unexpected, but logical - not outlandish.

Years ago I might have felt that the depiction of the FBI agents was exaggerated, but after the current years' revelations of their activities, I find everything not only apparently accurate but almost understated at times. The two major characters are carefully and gradually revealed to us until we understand the personal difficulties Hank and Frank have

undergone in their lives, which to some extent lay the groundwork for their behavior.

I highly recommend it for the whole family.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,not the most dynamic movie of the season *spoilers*,43656,wyn_fair79,26 December 2002,"""Catch me if You Can"" though not the most dynamic movie of the year, is definately one of the better movies I have seen for some time. It lacks the grandeur and stunning sights of 'Towers' and Gangs' and therefore relies on the basics of moviemaking...good direction, acting, and a good story. And Speilberg doesn't fail in delivering a movie to keep you entertained for two and a half hours. However, when looking at the movie in parts, the audience is left wanting something a bit more. DeCaprio fails to convince that he is a young boy who is running away, not from the feds, but from the failed relationship of his parents.And when he reached the point where he can no longer live in denial, you don't really feel for him. Nor does Hanks quite earn your sympathy when he continually just misses catching DeCaprio. On the other hand, Walken manages to stir your emotions with his wonderful delivery as DeCaprio's father. Towards the end, Spielberg fails to wrap everything up as neatly as you would want. Nevertheless, it is a movie worth seeing at least once. It was good fun that will possibly be lost in the deeper movies and more cinematic movies of the season. But if you aren't in the mood to see an epic film or left wondering just what the movie was about, I recommend catching the flick when you have nothing better to do on a cold afternoon.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent film,43748,dee.reid,1 January 2003,"I just got home after seeing ""Catch Me If You Can"" at the movie theater. I must say that it is a truly amazing film that is funny, sad, and adventurous all at the same time. The performances are excellent and Steven Spielberg definitely has a winner on his hands.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Extraordinary!,43748,Csheppard,26 December 2002,"This film is a ""Based on a true story"" flick that follows Frank Abagnale Jr (aka Frank Taylor aka Frank Connors etc.) through an adventure that can only be described as 'Make believe' meets 'Hide-and-Seek' mixed with 'Monopoly'. Frank runs away from home at 17 when his parents divorce and reinvents himself - as a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and so on, living in grand style by defrauding banks of millions of dollars, passing fake checks, all the while playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse with an FBI agent whose mission it is to track him down and collar him.

The movie is definitely a tad on the long side, but it keeps pace - you don't get bored, and the plot/editing is unique...you don't have to worry about guessing the ending 30 minutes before it actually happens. I am not usually a DiCaprio fan, but he renders a very real, believable performance. Tom Hanks, however, needed a little more work with a dialogue coach...his 'accent' was so poorly done, I really couldn't tell where he was supposed to be from! Aside from that, a well-delivered character.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Good film, but not as good as it could be",43656,Spanner-2,1 January 2003,"This period film has Leonardo DiCaprio as a real life con man who pretends to be a airpline pilot, lawyer and doctor by watching tv shows and impersonating the characters. DiCaprio was born to play this part and pulls it off quite well, with the right mix of charm and youthful exuberance. Tom Hanks as the FBI Agent on his trail is somewhat less effective but aquits himself ok. This Steven Spielberg film works fairly well, but doesnt quite connect as it should as we never really get inside the head of the protagonist to know what makes him tick, sure his adventures are fun to watch but we dont care about him as much as we should. GRADE: B+

CatchMeIfYouCan,Well worth it.,43718,dhaufrect,31 December 2002,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is a well made and well acted cinema. It is one of the better films of the year. Handled as a comedy, it also is filled with tidbits of an historical character from the 50's who delights the audience with his enchanting smile. Christopher Walkins is the true star of the show in his performance as DiCaprio's father. His empathy is overwhelming and I highly recommend this movie for the whole family. It is both entertainment and an education.

His capers are fantastic and this real life story is portrayed spectacularly by Tom Hanks and DiCapprio pulls off the major role with ease. Steven Spielberg Directed, who can ask for anything more. This guy was simply fantastic and we loved this movie and the Tom Hanks character. Tom doesn't usually play second banana but he does it very well here and in our mind steals the show from Leo who does a very good job, but Hanks is Hanks. Don't miss it.

Leo was OK, Hanks was great, but Christopher Walken stoled the show. I can't remember the last time he gave a subpar performance. Spielberg's direction was appropriate and reminded me of what a good story teller he is.

Overall, I give it an 8/10, but Walken should get an Oscar nomination for his work as the father.

A different type of story for Steven Spielberg, but the story was very interesting (made all the more so because it all really happened).

Catch it while you can...a strong 9.0 out of 10.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Delightful fun!!,43687,RMurray847,31 December 2002,"It's nice to have Spielberg movie that doesn't have to be loaded with portent. Don't get me wrong, I like portent, but I went to this expecting escapism (based on the trailers) and I got it in spades! I was immediately caught up in the movie and enchanted by the light story. The characters were all likable. The period details really great (check out DiCaprio's Bachelor pad when he's pretending to be a doctor). Even the John William's score works nicely for a change. Everyone is working in the same light-hearted vein, and the tone is very nice and consistent throughout.

DiCaprio is very charming and believable, and in his few serious scenes, he brings some real pain to the proceedings. I hope this and Gangs of New York helps us remember that he actually was (and is) a good actor, and not just that obnoxious playboy from the post-Titanic days. Tom Hanks is great: we root for him to catch DiCaprio, and we root for DiCaprio not to get caught. That's part of the fun! And Christopher Walken really gives one of his best performances in a long time. He's the most ""serious"" character in the film, but he shows terrific heart and spirit, and only occasionally falls back to his ""creepy"" mannerisms.

This is not a serious work. It is meant to lighten your mood with a competent, straightforward telling of a truly engaging story. And it succeeds. I say ""catch it if you can.""",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Nice Change of Pace for Mr. Spielberg,43656,Ell-4,30 December 2002,"Don't have a lot to comment about. It certainly was an interesting film considering that it was based on a true story. Also it was good to get away from all the electronic devices used by Mr. Spielberg in his last two films.

Actually my motivation for writing this comment is one of the scenes in the film. I am really wondering whether it hit anyone else as it did me.

It took place during the dinner scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio is extolling his virtues to Martin Sheen, the father of his fiancee, who is quite skeptical and gives him a line if questioning. Immediately came to mind a similar scene, at the dinner table, from the 1972 film ""The Heartbreak Kid"". Charles Grodin is extolling his virtues and line of goods to Eddie Albert, father of Sybil Shephard. Mr. Albert tells our hero afterwards exactly what he thinks of him and from there, of course, the similarity ends.

Would recommend this film, good story and great acting. Tom Hanks is always superior and Christopher Walken should probably be up for supporting actor. His facial expressions alone were heart rending",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,One Of The Year's Best!!!,43748,ilovedolby,30 December 2002,"Catch Me If You Can [PG-13] Running Time, 2 hours: 20 minutes Starring: Leonardo Dicaprio Tom Hanks Christopher Walken

Directed by Steven Spielberg

Well Leonardo Dicaprio has returned to the big-screen these past few weeks with two great movies, by two great directors. The previous film that was released to star Dicaprio was Gangs Of New York, directed by Martin Scorsese. This week, we have a very different kind of movie from the man I like to refer to as `the great one,' called Catch Me If You Can. `The great one,' being Steven Spielberg, my favorite director who's made some of the finest motion pictures in history. In my opinion, the release of a Steven Spielberg film is an event. He's created some of the most memorable and beautiful scenes in movie history. For example, who could forget the touching goodbye of E.T., or the horrifying invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. Catch Me If You Can is no exception to the greatness of Steven Spielberg's direction. This isn't one of his best movies, but it is one of the best films of 2002. What's more, who could resist a movie that also stars Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. The story was inspired by the real events of Frank Abagnale, who as a young man eluded the authorities of millions of dollars in check fraud. Dicaprio plays Abagnale, and he certainly pulls off a stellar performance that will leave you laughing and saying, `my God, how does he get away with all this!' Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who tracks Abagnale across the world. Among the identities that Abagnale assumed while forging checks was that of an airline pilot for Pan Am, a doctor, and a lawyer. It all leads to Abagnale one day working for the FBI in the check fraud division, and helps bring many criminals to justice. This film is really witty and will certainly leave it's audience pleased. Many people agree that the film is fun to watch, as well. It's especially great to see Leo portray the young Frank Abagnale, as Frank becomes obsessed with modeling himself after James Bond. Even going as far as to buy an Aston Martin with the money that he's received from the forged checks. This film is definitely worth seeing and is certainly one of best movies of the year. Quite possibly, in my top five picks of the year. And actually, I liked this more than Spielberg's other film released this past summer, Minority Report that starred Tom Cruise. Great work by John Williams on scoring another fine soundtrack to another great Spielberg film. Williams uses some jazzy ensembles in the score to represent the time and feeling of the film, although the main title theme of Catch Me If You Can is hardly one of a large sweeping theme. Nonetheless, there's little if anything to complain about here. The film works on all levels and I highly recommend seeing it. I was waiting to acknowledge what the best movie of the year was until I saw Catch Me If You Can. Well, I don't think that Catch Me If You Can is the best movie of the year, although one of the best films of 2002. ****",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,An entertaining film,43687,mrow,29 December 2002,"Just a short piece about ""Catch Me.."" (no spoilers here). I think Leonardo C was correctly cast. They needed someone who could pass for age 18 but also who was pretending to be 8 or 10 years older, as the featured main-character/con artist. He does look awfully young, but I think it came off ok. The understated score was by Williams (no surprise) but was very different from other works he has done, and generally works well for the film. It is as unlike the score for Harry Potter as night and day, and does demonstrate Williams' versatility (although Schindler's List has long since put any concerns in that area to rest). I was not able to identify the composer prior to seeing his name, momentarily wondering if it might possibly be Dave Grusin or perhaps J. N. Howard or even Howard Shore. The director is an excellent storyteller, but I am left wondering how others might have handled certain treatments. There was good audience reaction and I would imagine it will continue to do well at the box office. I would like to find out what the budget was, but for dart-throwing fun I would guess it at $75mil. Tom Hanks as the hapless FBI agent-in-charge is entertaining as well, and Christopher Walken also has a good part in this. I would imagine that I will see this film again, sometime.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catchy!,43687,elcopy,29 December 2002,"So what in the world made Spielberg chose this topic for a film is beyond me. Just while watching it I realized I was actually having fun. This movie is

definitively a crowd pleaser which should score Spielberg and the stars in it some deserved box office dough.

Every critic in the site may talk about Hanks, DiCaprio or Walken, but the real great performance in this movie came from no other than John Williams, who

produced his best movie score in more than 20 years. Catch Me if You Can's

theme is a fun, jazzy tune that is worthy of other tunes of the era this movie takes place, like Peter Gunn and the Pink Panter. It's been a long, long time I saw people walking out of a theater humming the main music piece of a movie. I

declare John Williams the comeback of the year.

Spielberg is a great story teller. This movie makes up for his mediocre, but

visually stunning Minority Report, Hank's overly soggy Road to Perdition and

DiCaprio's messy and self-indulgent Gangs of New York.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Blessed Return to Normalcy,43718,Quicksand,29 December 2002,"A good story. Not nearly as pretentious, overblown or intellectually devoid as, say, everything Spielberg has directed since 1994.

It still has its flaws, and I'm wondering if ol' Spielberg chose to focus on the father-son relationship a little more than other important aspects of Abagnale's life... or if he's just showing his lack of ability to direct actors. I know, I know, that's blasphemy... but the parents in ""A.I."" and the modern-day old people scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan"" were just SO bad, I have to wonder if he picked Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen for ""CMIYC"" because a) They wanted to work with him badly, or b) They wouldn't require the direction of someone less experienced or less accomplished. Sound fishy? Explain the parents in ""A.I."" Switched loyalties like some people switch channels........

As for ""Catch Me,"" it's a cute, breezy film, with very few flaws. The most glaring:

a) Jennifer Garner's one scene makes absolutely no sense, it's a non-sequitur. If she'd turned out to be an undercover agent, that would have been something. Instead, she just shows up, pulls money from her bra, and is gone again. I felt violated, like I just watched a plug for her television show in the middle of an otherwise fun movie. She obviously wasn't a prostitute because Frank says he recognizes her... I never did understand the fascination with this actress (assuming any actually exists).

b) Brenda Strong, and her father, played by Martin Sheen. Once they exit the film, they are never mentioned again. They're set up to be fairly important in Frank's life, and I'm left wondering what became of them / Frank's relationship with them. This isn't a plot hole, so much as a huge gaping annoyance. Perhaps Spielberg is getting senile; no, it's not the screenwriter's fault, the director should be able to look at the script and go, ""Hey, Jeff, what happens to characters X, Y and Z?""

Beyond that: cute, breezy and worth seeing at least twice, so you can put it all together and admire some of the DP's camerawork (which alternates between the fancy and the mundane). Kudos to Nathanson/Spielberg for giving it a fourth and fifth act, and giving us that much more about Abagnale's life.

Flawed, but only a few film geeks will notice. It gets an A from me, your opinion may vary. 9/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Making A Dishonest Living,43718,virek213,28 December 2002,"Once again, director Steven Spielberg pulls another one of his patented surprises with CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, a juicy crime caper film set in the 1960s and based on the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who ran away from home and went on a three-year spree of check forgery amounting to over $4 million. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Abagnale, who managed to impersonate a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and pretty much every other legitimate line of work to make himself rich before FBI agent Carl Hanratty finally caught up with him.

As played by the always-reliable Tom Hanks, Hanratty is a dedicated and cunning foil for DiCaprio's con-man Abagnale. The two men find themselves locked into a deliciously suspenseful game of cat and mouse that frequently resembles Hitchcock's great caper films of the 50s. The main titles sequence is priceless in its own right (if one didn't know better, one would swear this film had actually been made in the early 1960s), and John Williams concots a jazzy score redolent of Henry Mancini's classic 60s film scores. Featuring co-starring turns by Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is yet another triumph for Spielberg, one of the greatest directing geniuses in Hollywood history.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,touching feel good movie,43687,syllopsium,24 March 2003,"Where DiCaprio failed in Gangs of New York, he succeeds magnificently in Catch Me If You Can.

Touching and funny with an excellent cast, Catch Me If You Can is excellently directed and captivates. All the more remarkable for being based on a true story it skilfully combines Frank's scams with the relationship with his father.

Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks and DiCaprio all entertain. The only real flaw with the movie is that some of the schemes seem a little implausible - but this is a feelgood movie, not an accurate guide on how to become a con artist.

8/10 - recommended

CatchMeIfYouCan,Easily the best film of 2002!!!,43748,vyperman7,28 December 2002,"The film is based on the true life story of Frank Abignale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio)who proved to be the most successful con-man in history by being able to assume several different identities which included a history professor, a lawyer, a doctor, and a Secret Service agent, to cash more than 4 million dollars in fake checks in the United States as well as 26 other countries. Carl Harnatty ( Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent in charge of running the Check Fraud division of the FBI. ""Catch Me If You Can"" takes us on the exciting and extremely funny cat and mouse chase between the two men.

I have now seen both ""Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers"", and ""Catch Me If You Can."" ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a lot better, and easily the best film of 2002. The film succeeds on so many levels. The first is that the film is based on the amazing true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. He was the most cunning and successful con-man in history, and was able to accomplish everything he did before the age of 19. What makes the film even better, is the fact that it follows extremely close to the novel of the same name, written by Frank himself. The next reason is because of the direction of Stephen Spielberg. The film was paced extremely well, and even though the film is almost 2 1/2 hours, it never seems long, or drawn out. The set designs were also very authentic, and he managed to get the best performances possible out of the actors. This of course leads into the third reason of the film's success which were the amazing performances given from the cast. Leonardo Dicaprio has never really done it for me before. I love his films, but not him. However, he gave the best performance of his career. He is extremely witty and cunning which let him play the different identities of doctor, lawyer, etc so convincingly. Tom Hanks was awesome as Carl Harnatty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives to catch Frank. But he will also make you laugh with his Boston accent, and how naive he can be. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Alias' Jennifer Garder, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and the rest of the cast were all excellent as well. Finally, the film is down right hillarious and fun to watch overall. I was laughing for the whole entire film, and I actually enjoyed watching Frank from one moment to the next.

""Catch Me If You Can"" offers an extremely accurate portrayal of Frank's Abignale Jr.'s life, outstanding performances, outstanding direction from Spielberg, and you will laugh harder than you ever have before. If you are having a hard time deciding to what to watch this holiday season, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is definately a film that you need to see!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Am I The Only One Who Read The Book First?,43687,tbabe29,26 December 2002,"Frank Abnigale Jr. appeared on the TV show PEOPLE ARE TALKING in the early 90's I believe. My mother and I were in awe of this man's true story and bought and read his book. I kept waiting for a movie to be made, but it never happened.....until now.

This is a GOOD MOVIE, but 2 hours is just not long enough to tell all the juicy details of this man's story. This movie is entertaining, but lacks the depth of the whole story. But heck, it's just a movie.

I, for one, wouldn't have minded seeing this movie play longer, but I am sure the studios didn't want to release a 3 hour movie. A two part mini-series might still give the story justice. Frank Abnigale Jr. did so much more than what was put into this movie. It was still fun though.

Left out, were quite a bit of the details about how he LEARNED fraudulent technique. I wonder if Spielberg thought the audience would be bored by such detail, but in fact, I would have been riveted. The movie feels like it's in a hurry (hardy har har) and is afraid of boring its audience.

Too fluffy for oscar buzz with the exception of Christopher Walken. Hey - maybe they will turn it into a series on cable.....8/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of Spielberg's best,43748,paulmg,26 December 2002,"Though ""Minority Report"" seems to be generating the most talk

this year, it is this ""little"" film from Spielberg that is the real

highlight of his recent body of work. Spielberg takes what would be

a slight story in any other director's hands and turns it into butter: to

paraphrase Walken in the film, Spielberg is the second mouse.

Stealing the show is Walken as DiCaprio's IRS-plagued father.

With his few scenes he displays a tremendous range, and brings

depth to an underwritten character. But that takes nothing away

from the best performance of DiCaprio's career, as a teenage

conman who can make anyone believe he's something he's not.

Both performances, and the film, should be remembered come

Oscar time.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can: 8/10,43687,movieguy1021,26 December 2002,"Catch Me If You Can starts off with a boom with a very suave opening credits sequence, where sample people are chasing/being chased and using the credits to hide. Very clever, like the rest of the movie. Then we go to Marseille, France, where Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is talking to Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and he is released from prison. We are then taken six years earlier, to 1963.

Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a grifter of sorts, but nothing major. He's being investigated for tax fraud. And when Frank's mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) is caught cheating, Frank leaves home and first tries out theft in his father's petty ways. Soon he gets way over his head and becomes infamous for writing checks, and soon he's stolen over $4 million. But Hanratty and the FBI is close onto Frank, but always one step behind.

I have got to hand it to Steven Spielberg-taking a concept that people like I haven't heard of (gotta read the book!) and manipulating it into a multi-layered story of cat-and-mouse. Of course, it could have been better if there had been more sub-plots. It's mainly Frank having fun and Hanratty chasing him. Also, Hanratty's person needed more depth, but I'll talk about that later.

Catch Me If You Can has a good deal of humor for a movie billed as a drama. Its opening credit sequence and Frank's schemes took most of the humor. During his first day at a new school, at a French class, there's no teacher, so why not act as one? That was his first step to stardom, so to speak. I love how he made the checks at PanAm (I'll keep it a surprise). The first half was better than the second half, because it was funnier and more involved. The first half had information about the family and his jobs as a PanAm pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Of course, he hasn't had any training, and it's always worth a laugh to see him struggle. The second half took itself too seriously, and had the now-famous Spielberg fake ending, but at least it wasn't as severe as AI or Minority Report.

Depth of the characters, you ask? The movie focused most of the time on Frank, Jr., of course, but we do know some about Frank, Sr. His mother was very underdeveloped and could have been utilized better. Hanratty, we don't really know much about, so it's hard to get deep into his character (but you did get to like Frank). We do learn about his past at the end, but that's kind of unnecessary, isn't it?

Leo, I'm not sure if he deserved a Golden Globe nomination, but he was very good. I enjoyed his `dapper dan' attitude, which is what the whole movie was like. It didn't find itself serious (until the end), so it allowed some sort of suave cockiness, which added to the fun and the authentic feel of the 60s (not that I would know, of course). Hanks, with his usual Southern accent, seemed fine (nothing like The Green Mile, though). All of the supporting characters knew their parts (and the one-liners didn't overact or anything!). Jennifer Garner, as a prostitute, is waster and not really needed, mainly just to get to the overlong 140 minute runtime.

It's really fun and unpredictable (except the ending); you don't know how Frank is going to conjure up his next scheme. Sure, it tried to get sappy at the end, but it made you feel good, and that's what great movies are all about.

My rating: 8/10

Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief language.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Interesting But Not Fascinating,43656,bix171,25 December 2002,"Steven Spielberg's entertaining chase comedy/drama features a couple of very fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as a forger who travels the world and the FBI agent determined to haul him in. Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., it fits nicely into the Spielberg canon of films about splintered families; Abagnale's underlying motivations concern his determination to recover what the I.R.S. has taken from his tax-evading father and, in the process, repair his broken home. Though it's an interesting story, it's not an extremely fascinating one: once Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson have set up the basic scams Abagnale operates, there's a lot of repetition over the first three-quarters of the film's 140 minutes (the action could have been pared a bit in the editing room) and it refreshes only in the final section, where Hanks overtly assumes the role of surrogate father to DiCaprio's needy child. After a couple of moody, personal science fiction films in ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and ""Minority Report"", Spielberg seems intent on losing himself in a wistfully retro action story--the film takes place in the Sixties but a Kennedy-era-innocent Sixties that seems cloistered from the events we've chosen to make iconic--but he's unable to let go of his dark side (he's probably incapable of ever making an `E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' again) and the film wallows in its unhappiness. But he's energized by the engrossing lead performances that dominate everything around them: as people consumed by the actions of escaping and capturing, DiCaprio and Hanks lock into each other and the relationship they form subtlety invites the viewer into their game; Spielberg wisely allows the actors to interpret the material directly and keeps the pressure off the audience by making everything clear and digestible. With Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken, amusing and intelligent as Abagnale's father. The harsh sunlit cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the cleverly mod production design is by Jeannine Claudia Oppewall. John Williams' unassuming, jazzy score is surprisingly good, considering the source.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Amusing joy ride of a film,43656,existenz-6,15 December 2002,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is easily Spielberg's best film since ""Saving Private Ryan"", and his best comedy ever. The film is a funny, exciting, adventurous journey into the world of conman extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr. If you don't know who he is now, you will after seeing this movie.

Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much going into this. Spielberg's films have become so premeditated recently, with just the right angle, just the right piece of music and just the right look of awe on the actors' faces, that his films haven't been truly enjoyable for some time. He's like a novelist who, despite great diction and flawless punctuation, has lost his touch when it comes to story and character. With ""Catch Me If You Can"", Spielberg has finally loosened up and let the story take center stage. It's an understated but mesmerizing success. I even forgot that I was watching a Steven Spielberg film, which is a sign of how good it is.

Christopher Walken, who did a Q&A after the screening, said that this movie was filmed very quickly. Maybe that's why Spielberg didn't burden the movie with too much style -- he didn't have time to.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Very cool,43687,rynostevie,14 December 2002,"I just saw this movie in its first public screening at the LA Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. Going in I did not know what to expect, mostly because of the fact that Spielberg directed and because of the presence of a former distaste in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say I was very surprised at the finished product which was very cool, very well done, witty, and just an all around good movie. I have not seen a biography film done so well since, well I guess since I first saw The Passion of Joan of Arc. DiCaprio appears to be back on the top of his game. Hanks... is Hanks. I love Hanks so I can't say anything bad about him. And of course, Christopher Walken in the role of the Frank Abagnale, Sr. There is a glimmer of Captain Koons, his cameo in Pulp Fiction, in his character in this movie, although he is very much more fun, and crime, loving. There is little suspense thriller or action in this movie, but it is more than made up for with the depth that Spielberg achieved in his characters as well as in the drama. A very representative scene of these characters is when Frank, Jr. has been caught posing as a substitute and teaching his English class at his new high school for a week before he is figured out. His parents are both brought in to the principals office and informed of his behavior as he is forced to sit outside the office and watch the proceedings. When his parent finally emerge they have grave looks on their faces as they escort him out. The mother exits frame as Frank, Sr. walks beside his son looking down condescendingly. It appears that Frank, Jr. is busted. Then out of nowhere Frank, Sr. pulls this jovial smile and the tension is released. Frank, Sr. is proud of his son's accomplishment. A very interesting relationship operates between the two for the entire movie along these lines. In addition to the screening, Christopher Walken was there for a little Q&A afterwards. Weird dude. Funny, but weird.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A terrible film from a director who should know better,43475,mikek-6,3 February 2003,"Spielberg has made some awful films in his long career (AI for one) but this is by far his worst. Its such a shame because the guy is obviously highly talented, doesn't need the cash, and should have the confidence in his own abilities and the audience not to need to stoop to Disney techniques in order to embellish a great, true story. So many things just didn't add up, particularly in some of the characterisations - the young girl's parents, for instance, just weren't the type to have thrown her out of the house when they found she was pregnant. No, reality really is better than fiction and all those things that Spielberg added in a naive attempt to interest the audience were just the things which turned them off. And, oh, what was that awful boring, long, pastiche of a title sequence at the front? Most of the audience were asleep, or talking, before they saw the first frame of the story. Hollywood yet again gets it wrong.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg's Dreadful Remake of The Great Impostor.,43475,vitaleralphlouis,9 August 2005,"How many dreadful movies can this Spielberg guy generate before the public catches on that he's a flash-in-the-pan non talent who got lucky with Jaws and Raiders, crash-diving every time thereafter. Sure, some were taken-in by Saving Private Ryan, actually taking it as a patriotic movie when, in fact, it thoroughly trashed our World War II veterans. Perhaps the day has arrived, as this and other Spielberg films (Terminal, Lady Killers) did poor box office.

Herein Spielberg takes a hand at retelling the story previously filmed well by Universal in ""The Great Impostor"" starring Tony Curtis. The original film was definitely offbeat, but lighthearted. Impossible to believe, except they said it was all true. The newer version has a nasty tone to it, and fails to engage the audience. I like Leonardo De Caprio a lot, but thought he struck out in this one. Tom Hanks used to be an exceptional actor, but now seems content to be an extended body part to his one and only master.

This is really half a review, as I couldn't get beyond 60 minutes of the dreary mess.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,"The most saccharine, sentimental depiction of sociopathy, ever",43534,smoky_circles,9 January 2009,"Frank is a con-(young)-man. He cashes fake checks totaling up to millions, cheats and lies his way into several professions, and charms several women onto his sheets...but that is just because he is a lonely, lost boy, because his father was always in money trouble, and he had a broken home. He writes sentimental letters to his father, offers him expensive gifts, and talks about his mother rejoining them. He is actually a genius, see, and, when given the chance, proves himself to be virtuous by helping the authorities. And he has good, honest, hardworking potential too!! -- he passed the bar exam all on his own after loads of studying. This movie struck me as so false throughout that I couldn't help but see through it and overcompensate for its dishonesty and false sentimentality by continuously re-imagining it: what might REALLY have happened? How sociopathic might Frank have been to lie, cheat and steal so easily and continuously? How many women might he have slept, really? And how many times did people catch on to him? A brief look at a wiki article proved my suspicions. Frank's first victim was his own father. He ran away from home and never looked back. He failed the bar exam several times and his passing may have involved bribery and other methods of cheating. After being placed in prison he tried to escape to Brazil but was caught repeatedly. His cons sometimes failed as people suspected his lies. If this story was even mildly hollywoodized, I would have been fine with it (and if the writing, acting and visuals weren't as bland). But it takes sentiment and dishonesty to the oomphth degree. Take for example the window scene near the end. It again reinforced the theme that Frank was just a lost and lonely boy who committed all these crimes because he missed his mother. And the cheesy label-removing motif. That was just a waste. Tom Hank's character was worst at the beginning when he was going room to room shouting comically and trembling like an old lady. He got slightly better at the end. Leonardo's character was as I mentioned unnatural and flat, so I guess he made the best of it. The female characters were very fake and comic-booky and annoying, yelling ""yes, yes"" during the sex scenes or crying after being yelled at by their boss and falling bashfully head over heels for the guy who comforts them. The worst offenders might have been the FBI and law enforcement folk who were a bunch of bumbling cartoonish idiots, too shy to reach their arms over for a fork. There were also a whole bunch of random scenes that didn't give anything to the movie. Some, like the prostitute scene seemed to be out of nowhere and would have fit in more if the whole movie wanted to show Frank as mildly sociopathic (which would have been more realistic). The one scene that I did like was when the agent came to France to see Frank's setup. Money flying everywhere and tilted camera angles gave it a cool look. But even then you are given the dishonest condition of Frank in stress and somewhat unraveling, a condition which screams at you, 'hey! look! look how worn out and rambling he looks! This criminal spree is taking a toll on him too, you know. He does have a heart!'",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,The True Story of a Successful Con Man in a Time When Persons Were Very Innocent,43687,claudio_carvalho,21 November 2003,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the beloved son of Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken) and the French Paula Abagnale (Nathalie Baye).

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch this film if you can.,43656,lee_eisenberg,19 January 2006,"I'd never heard of Frank Abagnale Jr before ""Catch Me If You Can"" came out, but what a guy! Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio's cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the '60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn't Steven Spielberg's best movie by any stretch, but it's sure a neat one. There is one scene that's probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Cool.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Glossy, but not always classy",43626,Jexxon,30 December 2004,"OK comedy/drama telling the story of young con man DiCaprio, chased by Hanks' FBI man.

The opening credits and score set the tone for this retro looking film. Overall, it has an air of being old-school. It's not very dark or foul mouthed, and it's not a pure comedy either. It has a nostalgic touch to it, which I guess is supposed to draw in the crowds for an old fashioned crime caper of sorts.

However, I thought the film felt kind of schizophrenic. The comedy bits are those that work best (Hanks' best work so far in my opinion), but judging from the subject matter, this should have been a considerably darker film in tone. It's like Spielberg didn't know how to put the story together as it displays numerous mood swings - sometimes serious, sometimes definitely not. Structrually, the film also feels a bit weak, it would have worked better with linear storytelling, rather than jumping back and forth in time.

The acting is OK, but I could never really get to grips with DiCaprio's character (and in some scenes, neither did DiCaprio). The production design, cinematography, and score work fine together but the story never quite holds up. There is nothing remarkable about the film, and towards the end, Spielberg's sappier movie sentiments makes for some not so good movie time, unfortunately. [6/10]",neg

CatchMeIfYouCan,Superficial whiff of an idea,43595,moonspinner55,21 December 2002,"Although taken from an intriguing true story about a teenage con-man, this Steven Spielberg film is neither funny enough to be a comedy, dramatic enough to be a solid drama, nor suspenseful enough to be a good caper. It's blandly straightforward film-making, hurt mostly by a script that needs us to fill in the blanks and a one-note performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead. Tom Hanks is far superior as the head Fed on the case, while Jennifer Garner has a superfluous role as a model-cum-prostitute and Christopher Walken is unable to create a convincing character as Leonardo's father. The period detail is careful but disappointing, and the overlong film takes a good 40 minutes to kick into gear. **1/2 from ****

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of the Best Dramas with Humor,43687,tabuno,26 January 2019,"29 December 2002. This is one of the best dramas I have seen that incorporates humor. While audiences have been offered horror genres that have humor and comedies that have dramatic elements, Catch Me If You Can is one of the few dramas I have come across that includes a wry sense of humor that isn't tacky or add-ons. Christopher Walken delivers a great performance and a real award-winning performance. The editing and the placement of scenes in flashback fashion is timely. This really is a feel good movie with substance, with real drama. This is entertainment at its finest. DiCaprio is making the transition from Titanic in grand fashion and making a statement that his earlier performance wasn't a one time deal. He must have a fabulous agent. Now only if Tom Hanks had an accent that was...different in the movie.

'Catch Me If You Can (2002)' is well-made and enjoyable throughout, the kind of flick to put a smile on your face and keep it there.

I'm no huge fan of Steven Spielberg and the lavish devotion he attracts, even though he's made a lot of films I enjoy. It seemed to me to be a vehicle for a smug Leonardo DiCaprio outwitting the authorities at every turn. Now I've watched it, I admit that I was completely wrong. DiCaprio plays a thoroughly sympathetic character whose side you are on from the outset thanks to a clever set-up involving his relationship with his father, a decent Christopher Walken. The viewer can then sit back and simply enjoy watching him as he attempts to beat the system by becoming a master fraudster. The fact that this is a true story helps a lot too. It's not as assured as Spielberg's deadly serious fare like BRIDGE OF SPIES and MUNICH, but it's much better than his twee, sentimental body of work.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can is a classic cat-and-mouse chase that feels refreshingly whimsical.,43687,TheMovieDiorama,27 February 2018,"Spielberg is damn versatile. He is able to craft some of cinema's hard hitting dramas (Schindler's List), biggest blockbusters (Jurassic Park) and child-friendly tales (E.T.). This film is rather overlooked in his filmography, which surprises me considering the talent on screen. Part biopic and dramatisation of Frank Abagnale Jr's youth where he was able to utilise the power of deception to successfully disguise himself as a pilot, doctor and prosecutor in order to check in cheques. The youngest counterfeiting fraudster in America at the time. The greatest compliment I can give the story, is that it doesn't take itself seriously. This could've been a melodramatic crime thriller, but instead Spielberg twists the style and turns it into an exciting watchable chase that consistently put a smile on my face. Would it have been more poignant and resonating if it was powerful? Perhaps, but the film successfully entertains and sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended). There was only one actor who could pull off the suave deceptive con artist, and that's Leonardo DiCaprio. An absorbing performance that gave him an opportunity to be slightly cheeky yet maintain a sense of class which I'm sure paved the way for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. I loved the use of psychology and how the human mind can be convinced through simple sleight of hand gestures. A story of how living in a lie can often feel better than residing in reality. Utilising false identities to reinvigorate one's self and change their way of living, albeit being extremely illegal. Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent tasked with hunting down Frank Jr with what is one of his lighter performances. A young Amy Adams was also likeable. Spielberg is a chameleon. He can take any genre and create an excellent film without the need of over-stylisation. His techniques just blend in. Also, the opening credits scene was hypnotising, adored the animation. An irresistible light hearted tale.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Brilliant, especially DiCaprio",43718,vikasgami,9 October 2017,"While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good. From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,heartwarming,43718,bachispicaqtmz,10 August 2017,"The fact that this story is true surprised me. While I want Carl to catch Frank as soon as possible, I do want Frank to manage to run away. At the beginning, Frank's past are drawn. Without these scenes, you only hate him throughout. But due to it, the audience unconsciously wish he manages to run away from Carl. I admire Frank's quick wits. The scene that he tries to perform an operation though he is not a doctor is very funny. At the scene of the previous night of Frank and Brenda's wedding makes me cry. She believes he is innocent. This scene is the most beautiful for me. Finally, frank is arrested but for Carl's consideration, he is able to have an opportunity to start over. I like happy ending like this.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Do you concur?,43687,sharky_55,11 February 2016,"Leonardo DiCaprio occupies the role of Frank Abagnale with such ease that it is easy to forget that he is just a teen at the beginning - and barely an adult when it is over. I suppose it is easy for him to forget this too; slipping into these alternate identities lets him live the life he wants, get back the money they took from his father, and escape from a broken family. When he mimics the famous two mice in a bucket of milk speech when asked to say grace, it is funny, but also contains a hint of melancholy like Walken's sparse appearances throughout his con life. The suit, the cadillac, the money...all just items to show off to his father, to show that he has made it, to try and piece this family back together again. How many windows has he peered into to see happy Christmas celebrations? How many half-sisters has he waved at?

Momentarily, he distracts himself with the thing he is good at. A little folded note, a little substitute teacher impersonation. Then onto bigger things, and although we know how the story ends, we are nevertheless fascinated. Spielberg's direction is visually captivating - the peering reveal over to the bathtub full of model air-planes, the swing across to the frightened bank teller informing her manager (to signal one plan that doesn't work - so he learns and adjusts his cons), the way he racks focus from the fine print of the check to DiCaprio to indicate just how precise and alluring his charms and deflections are. Williams is great too - the way he builds momentum and confidence as Frank becomes more adept, and twinkles when we see closeups of the favourite trick that he inherited from his father. Completing the effect are those endearing voice-overs of faux-success and worldly experience to his father - no doubt a very important part of his motive is to impress him.

This is one of DiCaprio's better performances. He doesn't have a whole lot of emotional range to work with (for example, the real Abagnale left his medical supervisor position because he realised he was putting lives at stake - in the film it is completely comedic) and even when he does emote it is somewhat an act - see the bait and switch where he seems to confess to Roger Strong, but becomes a soppy romantic instead. His best moment is the way he slides effortlessly into the Secret Service Agent 'Barry Allen' only after a tiny second of realisation of what he has been caught in - the way his approach disarms Hanratty so subtly (""Here, take my whole wallet""), the way he mimics his tactics to build authenticity (""Mind if I see some identification"") and how he is able to uses his own knowledge to pose as someone who has been diligently chasing himself down. Hanks' Hanratty is decent as the straight man who is initially consumed by the chase; there are some juvenile moments including a harsh cackle over the phone at Christmas which doesn't quite work because Hanks is not mean enough for it and because their dynamic works so much better when they are ribbing and teasing - Hanratty not falling for his whole sickness routine in jail, and constantly trying to pry his methods for passing the bar exam.

It even manages to be a little poignant at the end between the two. Feeling suffocated by the never-ending sentence to bust the scams he once mastered, he takes off and even makes it to the airport to seek that life of lies that seems to be easier than confronting the truth; the death of his father, and the new marriage and family of his mother. Hanratty is all but ready to let him go, but reminds him that no one will be chasing this time. Perhaps he was right when he realised that Abagnale had no one to call at Christmas. DiCaprio's frenzied reaction to seeing him deep in hiding in France suggests that he is most at ease constantly moving from place to place and busying himself with the thrill of the chase. Even James Bond had to call it a day when his time was up, and Frank is now ready to accept it.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,This game is good fun.,43687,troyputland,16 January 2016,"A cat and mouse game repeated over and over sounds a tad dull, but not when it's directed by Steven Spielberg! Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abagnale is deceitful and deceptive, but not nasty. Instead he's huge fun to be around. Same goes for Tom Hank's catcher, who incidentally, finds it difficult to do the catching. Catch Me If You Can, to not seem too rigid or sound mundane, splices the story from when Abagnale's already captured, to the how and why, the very beginning, up until Abagnale's inevitable capture. It's a slick, cool process held strong by its two leads. I wish there was more room for Hanks to thrive, as DiCaprio fills the screen with his charm and intelligence.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Reel Time Reviews ""Catch Me If You Can (2002)""",43687,Reel_Time_Reviews,15 January 2016,"Catch Me If You Can is a film Directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002

""A true story about Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars' worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor.""

Catch Me If You Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a young con artist being chased across America by the FBI investigator Carl Handratty (played by Tom Hanks) as he is chased across all 50 states in America for stealing over $4 million in fraudulent cheques. It really is a movie that you can re-watch over and over again, however although I found it very entertaining and fun to watch, like all movies it had it's flaws.

Obviously the movie is an adaptation of the life of the real con artist Frank William Abagnale Jr. and the events that took place during his life when he was growing up. From impersonating a substitute teacher at his high school to becoming a lawyer just to marry a girl whom he fell in love with, the movie follows Frank's life and engages the audience by keeping them entertained. The biggest flaw that the movie had for me was the significantly huge lack of Christopher Walken in it. Although he was a very influential and important figure in the movie, specifically for Leonardo DiCaprio's character, I personally would of liked to see the majestic works of Walken more frequent throughout the film. On a more serious note, sometimes the scenes can feel detached from the Actors and it creates a feeling of confusion as some things feel less believable than others.

The acting is to be applauded though, with such an amazing cast it's hard to make a movie like this not enjoyable. Most credit should be given to Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken for their characters and the interactions that they make with Frank. It is these relationships that engage the audience as they show the feelings between a struggling father and his son, along with the relationship between a criminal and the man chasing him down. Watching a young Leo cheat his way through life and avoid any confrontation with the FBI is both thrilling and entertaining as we truly get to see the retold events of Frank Abagnale on screen. We sympathize with him and understand the struggles he is going through. Leo's character is a prime example of an Anti-Hero, we know what he is doing is wrong but we don't want him to get caught because we want to see what he does next. Yet again Steven Spielberg combines a good cast, well written and entertaining script along with the magnificent music created by the phenomenal John Williams to create an exciting adventure inspired by real events. The setting of the 1960's is captured well and the audience really gets a feeling of the era that this took place in.

Overall Catch Me If You Can was an enjoyable experience with a lack of my on screen time for Christopher Walken, but made up for that with it's easy to follow and engaging plot.

8.0/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,Innovative,43687,nicolechan916,1 January 2016,"It is incredible to think that this film is based on a true story, and that a high school student was able to deceive so many people. What an ingenious and innovative kid - for the wrong reasons of course. I am unsure of the accuracy of the film's portrayal of the actual events, but Frank Jr. does seem to be quite mature for his age - at least his persona does. Adding to that, I feel like the romantic encounters (save for Brenda) was probably the influence of Hollywood, or dramatized at the least.

Leonardo DiCaprio perfectly encompasses the emotions of an emotionally troubled teen to the T. He portrays his character's naivety well, depicting both Frank's fake confidence and emotional turmoil. Supporting actors and actresses did a good job too. Walken as Frank's father and Hanks as Hanratty both support a kind of father figure to Frank though one is encouraging him not to stop and the other is trying to catch him.

The editing is well done with two different timelines juxtaposed against each other. At first it is a little confusing and hard to discern which time period is being shown, but it gets better as the film goes on. What I do not get is the very first scene of the film which shows a kind of game show. Not only is it a weird way to introduce the film it does not fit into the story at all. The film doesn't end with the game show, and it is not mentioned or seen again for the rest of the movie.

The designs of the set and the costumes are nicely done and adds to the atmosphere of the film. Also, I liked how there are quite a few cameos with well known actresses (although probably not so well known back then).

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Funny, Serious, Thoughtful, Low-key film - Spielberg Delivers",43687,jb_campo,27 December 2015,"I loved Catch Me If You Can, based on the real-life story of Frank Abagnale. Abagnale, portrayed beautifully by Leonardo DiCaprio), is a young kid who runs away from home and uses his guile, wits, charm, and good looks to con his way into real-life professions that take years of training. Pilot, Doctor, Lawyer, this 19 year old kid can do all theses things, or pretend to. What made him want to do this?

The film centers around the father-son relationship. Christopher Walken is outstanding as Frank Sr, a down-on-his-luck entrepreneur who has problems with the IRS coming after him for tax violations. But nothing bothers Frank Sr. He always keeps saying how he's the mouse who is going to survive by working harder. Yet, he seems to survive using smoke and mirrors, sweet talking people, and teaching his son that the image is more powerful than substance.

Frank Jr learns all these lessons and applies them to all aspects of his life, chasing women, jobs, and all the money and benefits these bring. But it seems he really just wants a happy family, something he didn't ever seem to have. His mother, played by famous French actress Natalie Baye, doesn't seem to really love him. She mostly ignores his existence.

Why should you see this film? The story is terrific, just the right pace of action and suspense. Is he going to get caught now? How is he going to pull this one off? The direction from Spielberg is right on. He tied everything together with no questions lingering at the end.

The acting is terrific too. Tom Hanks delivers a masterpiece as an obsessed FBI agent Hanratty who is in charge of capturing Abagnale who ends up stealing millions of dollars by the time he is through. The relationship between the pursuer Hanratty and the pursued Abagnale is great, and the movie portrays them as developing a relationship of friendship. Other characters play strong roles too, including a young Amy Adams as as love interest for Frank Jr.

I also loved the historical aspect of the airlines and the 60s, when pilots and flight attendants were considered glamorous positions. The old cars, the old uniforms, the costume designer and the cinematography really made the old times come to life with vibrant colors and a pizazz that maybe it didn't have, but it was nice to relive.

Story, Director, Acting, Cinematography - Catch Me If You Can has it all. I highly recommend you catch this movie if you can. Enjoy.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,a lot of fun,43687,rick-jatti,22 December 2015,"this is just a thoroughly enjoyable movie. it doesn't have any spectacular traits that make it outstanding, but its just fun all the way through. it has great characters, delightful performances that one would expect from the actors in these movies, and an enjoyable plot that never gets too fast or too slow. its the perfect pace, and has very few errors. the flaws of this movie are very slight and unnoticeable. the music ties into the movie very well and helps keep the pace and the mood. and don't get me started on the main character. leo depicts frank abagnale jr so flawlessly, and he is just full of charisma. its hard not to like him. christopher walken is as good as ever, which is shown by his Oscar nomination. tom hanks isn't his best, but that certainly doesn't mean he was bad. he was still very good, which, of course, is sub par for tom hanks. all in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie for someone who is looking to have fun rather than critique.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great job by Spielberg both technically and story-telling wise,43656,Seraphion,27 November 2015,"The movie opens up very very uniquely. Using the old show as a frame, it takes the audience's already owned recognition of DiCaprio to start telling the story chronologically. I really like how the movie immerses the audience in Frank's story. The movie moves forward nicely from event to event to depict the milestones in Frank's check forgery career. Also the cinematography at times indulges the audience with great moving shots. The acting work in overall is a great work. Having the cast comprise of an ensemble is a good thing to balance DiCaprio's acting in the scenes and also grab attention for them. Leo DiCaprio, despite his older age, managed to grab the youthful energy as an adolescent here. Tom Hanks did also well in portraying the relentlessness of the agent.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch me if you Can Review,43687,thescholar22,9 June 2015,"This movie came out in 2002 and was directed by Stephen Spielberg. It's about this guy Frank W. Abagnale Jr. coning as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer in the 1960's. The thing here is that he did all of this before he was 21. The movie starts off with a game show talking about why he did all of this. Then it goes to Frank in French prison in 1969, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He tries to escape but the flashes back to 1963 with his father, played by Christopher Walken, winning some kind of award. Later his father is investigated for tax fraud. As his father slowly loses his fortune and gets divorced Frank runs away. He learns coning from some tips his father did earlier in the movie. After coning as an airline pilot he starts to get the attention of an FBI agent Carl, played by Tom Hanks. Carl almost gets Frank but he gets away the first time they meet. Then he cons as a doctor to throw the FBI off and then a lawyer. You probably know from the opening Frank will get caught eventually. Thought after he gets back to America the ending is actually pretty good and satisfying. I think this movie also started to create the 60's craze until Mad Men perfected it a bit later. Anyway this movie is pretty good as a biopic about Frank's coning and struggle to get back his fortune.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Fascinating Biography,43687,gra-39317,2 May 2015,"Catch Me If You Can is based off a true story of a sixteen year old, Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo Dicaprio), who swindles millions of dollars from banks through check fraud and deception. It begins when Frank's mother and father get a divorce after his father gets in trouble with the IRS, Frank enters his crime spree in the hopes of gaining a fortune and getting his parents back together. He attracts the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who organizes a manhunt after the teenager.

This movie balanced the lighthearted absurdity and the dark reality of the situation, so that the audience transitions back and forth between chuckling with amusement and holding their breath with apprehension. With Frank Abagnale Jr being a genius young criminal evading the law, and Carl Hanratty being the serious, dedicated FBI agent trying to stop him, the viewer finds themselves rooting for both characters in the game of cat and mouse. Both Carl and Frank can be likable and despicable, smart and dumb, right and wrong. Their portrayal by actors Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks keeps the audience watching eagerly to the end.

Whether a viewer is initially attracted to the movie by the actors, the director, or the premise, they are sure to find themselves satisfied with Catch Me if You Can.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,An enjoyable film,43656,bbewnylorac,2 March 2015,"I loved Frank Abagnale's autobiography so I was worried what Steven Spielberg would do with the film, given he's known for giving his subjects the big Hollywood treatment. I was pleasantly surprised - I guess Abagnale's incredible true story suited the big treatment. Leonardo Di Caprio accurately captures Abagnale's immaturity and impulsiveness, disastrously combined with his fierce intelligence. He becomes a master con man living out every fantasy, as a pilot, a lawyer, a teacher, and even a doctor, and manages to swiftly dodge the consequences for years. It's comical, in a way, seeing the sheer audacity and inventiveness of the man. I love the scene where he strides across the airport with the air hostesses in their chic suits. It's funny to see how trusting and gullible companies such as banks and airlines and hotels were in the 1960s, and Frank just exploits it to the hilt. But also, as in the book, we see how terribly sad Abagnale is. In the end he has only his wits to live on, and it can't last if he's going to live a normal life. Things I don't like include how overblown the music score is. I hate it when the music tells you how you're supposed to feel in a scene. I don't like Tom Hanks as the detective -- he's too much of a clown. I love Christopher Walken as Frank's dad, also a bit of a sad character. Also the film does go on a bit long, but then there is a lot of Abagnale's life to squeeze on to the screen.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Incredible Story of a Fascinating Man,43687,RbDeraj,9 February 2015,"First of all, one thing you need to realize is that this is a true story. Is it a little overdramatized with some of the details fudged? Of course, but from what I've found it comes pretty close to the real thing. The film is about Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (played by DiCaprio) a teen who started committing fraud when he was 15 and before he was 21 years old he had stolen millions, created alibis, worked as a doctor, a pilot, and a lawyer for extended periods of time even though he wasn't actually any of them. He eluded the authorities all around the world for years eventually getting caught but not before escaping from custody twice. Tom Hanks plays the F.B.I. agent trying to catch him in this wonderfully entertaining film.

There were only a few problems I had with the film. Leonardo DiCaprio was around 27 when they filmed this and while he does look young for his age at one point they try to pass him off as a 12 or 13 year old which clearly does not work. Tom Hanks is not good with accents. In the movie I don't even know what he was trying to impersonate but it came out sounding more like a speech impediment like Elmer Fudd or Barry Kripke.

I'd give it a 9/10 just because I think it deserves to be higher than the 8.0 that it is currently at.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Modernity calling,43687,KINGJO4606-1,24 December 2014,"This is a helpful movie. It shows the viewer that not all people are honest, despite Leonardo's character being likable. His world-view that most people were selfish encouraged him to trod down the path he had taken before getting arrested. The film also demonstrates how divorce affects people. The scene which sticks in my mind the most happened at the end of the movie; he met his younger half-sister for the first time. But he also discovered his French, biological mother reading a book, happily remarried and unconcerned with the troubles of his own son. The film is a wake-up call to me because it shows you that others often are generally not concerned with your problems. DiCaprio's character redeemed himself at the end of the movie by becoming a man in charge of dealing with check fraud. Overrated movie but highly recommended.

8/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch this if you can,43687,Horst_In_Translation,28 November 2014,"""Catch Me If You Can"" featured 3 big names: Spielberg, Hanks and DiCaprio. So it was a bit surprising the film scored only two Academy Award nominations despite great reviews. Christopher Walken (playing the main character's father) lost a probably very close race against Chris Cooper. Spielberg had worked before with Hanks (""Saving Private Ryan"") and worked with him afterward again (""The Terminal""). In terms of Spielberg/DiCaprio and Hanks/DiCaprio it stayed the only collaboration. The book that this movie is based on was actually written by Frank Abagnale himself and he even has a small cameo playing one of the French cops who arrest ""himself"".

""Catch Me If You Can"" is a true quality movie. It delivers in terms of comedy as well as drama (the scenes with his girlfriend's dad, the talk about the dogs name, his mother's cheating, the divorce scene, the scene at his mother's house at the end...). Even if it is illegal, it is so much fun to watch Abagnale Jr. trick the FBI and also everybody else. Scenes I found particularly funny were the French class scene very early in the movie, the prostitute scene, the first meeting with Hanratty or the scenes at the hospital where he gets sick just like he does in the cockpit. Oh and lets not forget about Abagnale's first appearance at court and the judge's reaction to his actions. I laughed a lot. And even, when there is no DiCaprio on screen, there is occasionally some humor despite Hanratty being such a serious character, like when for example Abagnale's mother wants to take care of her son's wrongdoings with a quick check. The quiz show intro was a nice idea too.

There is so much details in this movie that you could watch it a dozen times and would most likely still find something new. Abagnale is a fascinating character. Despite his illegal actions, he is likable to the audience just like he is likable to the newspapers mentioned in the movie. Maybe that is because all he actually wants is piece within his family, first his parents, than with his girlfriend. Every time he erupts and commits a crime, there was some trigger before that disturbed the peaceful family life. It all starts when his father and mother get a divorce. The way he runs away and hopes for them to make up throughout the whole film reminds me of the scene early on when his mother spills some wine and there is some trouble. He leaves the room to get something to clean it up and when he returns his parents are dancing peacefully. When he is about to have his own family much later, he does not want to do anything illegal again, but is haunted by the ghosts of his criminal past. He even tells his girlfriend his real name when she asks him to. The ""Has anybody here seen Kelly""-scene is one of the most memorable of the movie. This is when Abagnale lets loose, loses his restlessness and truly transforms into a family person.

I liked Amy Adams here a lot and despite everything she has done afterward, this may very well be my favorite performance of hers. Another very good performance here comes from Christopher Walken, who plays maybe the most interesting character here. He definitely brings the best quotes to the table (why the Yankees win, the mouse metaphor). You cannot look away when he is on screen. You could almost call him a partner in crime to his son. His look at his son after the school principal tells Abagnale's parents about his son's pretending to be a teacher says it all. Later on, he tells Abagnale to keep going with what he does as he really caused trouble to the FBI big guys. Reason is probably his own struggles with financial authorities and he loves his son bothering them successfully. Apart from that, he is a really caring father and husband. While his wife immediately tells the FBI guys about her son, the father tells Hanratty he'd never do or say anything that could hurt his son. Sadly, at the end, we find out that the father was in fact the first mouse, the one that drowned and not the second who lived. The way he died is interesting too given the father-son talk about the car/train choice earlier. He fell down the stairs at the train station and broke his neck.

Finally, there is the relationship between Abagnale and Hanratty. Even if Abagnale becomes more and more Hanratty's Moby Dick, there seems to be a strange bond between these two. They talk to each other several times on Christmas as they both have nobody else to talk to. They are both slightly tragic characters. The prostitute scene against the launderette scene was pretty funny as it summarized their lives in a nutshell at that point (and how they got into contact with female underwear). And then there is the ending of course where we see how Hanratty saves Abagnale's life and even makes him his employee. He really seems unable to build up a relationship with his colleagues, but with Abagnale somehow it works at least to some extent, maybe because they are so good at what they do, even if their approaches are completely different and initially even at the opposite sides of the law. And they both have a sense of family as we see by Hanratty still with his wedding ring on and Abagnale asking him near the end to swear on his daughter.

There is really not much about this film that could have been better. I might have liked it even more if it had been completely chronological, but that's just me. I highly recommend watching this film. One of 2002's finest.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Great movie by the Great team,43687,shreekara-1995,20 September 2014,"There is a sayings in Sanskrit ""Udaranimitham Bahukritha Vesham"" - Man changes his shades because for his livelihood, it doesn't matters what he does but the ultimate aim of his all kind of work is to be happy.

''Catch me if you can'' is one such kind of movie that has something to say about the colors of life, this 2002's flick is all about a master conman by the name Frank Abegnale, who is accused for check forgery and praised for being a great trickster and paid for designing a safe checks that at present many banks and the world fortune companies use for the transaction. Well Frank's skill of con begins when he poses himself as a substitute French teacher in his school and when his family get disrupted with his parents taking a divorce he had nothing to do than to make use of his extreme notorious skills of cheating, firstly he get into the shoes of Pan Am co pilot and forges fake checks and eventually he put on the white coat and pose himself as a doctor where he falls in love with Brenda and later he switch his shades to pose as a lawyer, but in this action he is not alone, in this course of time Frank turned to be the most wanted by FBI and he is been chased by the FBI agent Carl who arrest Frank in France, but this tricky fellow escapes from the plane and finally he surrenders and undergo 12 years of imprisonment, but Carl notices his skill and make best use of him in solving various complex check forgeries eventually working for FBI, this is the plot of this neatly narrated movie and thing to be known is that Frank had done all this extraordinary fraud stuff before he was 20!

Leonardo DiCaprio is marvelous with his brilliant performance as Frank Abegnale and Tom Hanks had done a great job in the role of the FBI agent Carl, it's the director Steven Spielberg who magnificently taken the entire story in a very neat flow, Spielberg peculiarity of presenting the scene is awesome, symbolization is great, fine screenplay, overall its a great work by the great team.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,light hearted romp,43656,SnoopyStyle,10 November 2013,"Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a con man with a colorful career and father issues. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who doggedly hound Frank.

Director Steven Spielberg has instilled a sense of play in this true story. He could have made this a more intense thriller. But it ends up being a light hearted romp. I'm not deducting points for that. It's a choice Spielberg made for this movie.

Leo has all the fun. He is that guy. He is the suave playboy who can get all the girls base solely on his charm. This was probably happening even before he made a name for himself. Leo is Frank Abagnale Jr.

Tom Hanks is a little different. I am unconvinced that he is that guy. Tom is more light hearted and it adds to that prevailing sense. Would you be truly scared to be chased by Tom Hanks? No! He's my accountant.

Overall it's a light weight entry in Spielberg's list of accomplishments. Nobody will put this in the highlight reels for him but it's a good fun watch.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Romp with an Impostor,43656,evanston_dad,5 August 2010,"Steven Spielberg's account of the truly fascinating story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an impostor and con artist who waltzed from one side of the country to the other in the 1960s, ripping off just about everyone along the way.

The film's period look is a lot of fun, and though the film gets a little sluggish at times -- not a complaint I can usually level at a Spielberg film -- it remains pretty entertaining. My biggest complaint might seem like a nit-picky one, but regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski handles the film's cinematography all wrong. Kaminski takes the same approach to lighting his films no matter what the subject: washed out color, backlit interiors. This works for gritty stuff like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List,"" but doesn't for something like this film. But whatever....

Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail and Christopher Walken gives a heartbreaking, Academy-Award nominated performance as Abagnale's washed up dad.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Very Entertaining!,43748,g-bodyl,9 October 2008,"Catch Me If You Can is a very entertaining film. Even though there is not much action, the whole dilemma of the con artists is good enough. The plot is about a con artist named Frank Abagnale Jr and the way he tried to avoid authorities including Carl played by Tom Hanks. The acting in this film is very good. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks had very good chemistry together. I liked the way how DiCaprio was able to perform Abagnale. The whole concept of this film is highly interesting. it's nice to learn how con artists operated back in the 60's. The music by John Williams is another classic but it is different than his usual music. You can tell that it's by Williams, but the music has more of a jazz sound. Overall, this is a very good drama by Steven Spielberg. I rate this movie 10/10.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A fun filled ride,43656,ygodson,2 June 2008,"Just think this movie is based upon real characters.A fast paced movie which is worth mentioning.I don't have to say what would happen when thespians like Spielberg and Tom Hanks combine in a movie.

We have seen a lot of so called popcorn movies but this one is the epitome of such kind of movies.I would be unkind if I did not mention the fine acting of Leonardo De Caprio.Some of the scenes are really comic.

The first encounter scene of Abagnale with Carl Hanratt is really wonderful.Some dialogs like ""Do you concur?"" are worth mentioning.

7/10..Catch this one.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,a great movie,43687,d500,21 June 2007,"I have just seen this movie and it was a very entertaining experience.

The best thing about this movie (which is easy to overlook) is that although Frank is a cheat and a criminal in every sense of the word, we sympathise with him and want him to be more deceitful. We want to consciously overlook the moral bankruptcy. That is honestly how good the script and direction are.

The presentaion of the 60's is realistic and engaging. There are a few occasions where you think that Frank's ""heroics"" are somewhat exaggerated but perhaps it is understandable because he was a master con man. Di Caprio does not look 16 when he is portrayed as 16, but I guess you can't make someone aged 30+ appear that young no matter how hard you try! I did not like Di Caprio before I saw this movie but my perception of his talent has completely changed. He gives a spell bounding performance. In fact I don't think any other actor would have bettered his performance. He completely looks the character and portrays many different expressions with flawless expertise. Hanks is subdued but is reliable nonethless. The rest of the cast are also very able, be that Frank Sr or Frank Jr's would-be father in law.

In summary the direction, acting, scipt, photography, everything is top-notch. The only reason I don't give it a 9/10 is because it is a bit too long and I feel it could have been trimmed about 10-15 minutes. Well done Spielberg. Well done Di Caprio.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Great Movie,43748,orlando179,29 June 2006,"This movie was not at all what I expected. What I expected was a comedy and or sappy romance that was somewhat cheesy. It wasn't. In the past I had not been a big fan of Mr. Leonardos movies and I believed that he was too cocky to really portray a good and true character. In this movie I found that he could do almost anything. He can play the businessman, the caring son, the loving fiancé, the player, and the pitiful homeless kid that just wants a family. I have seen this movie 3 times and each time I cried. I guess that my favorite thing about this movie is that you never really know what is going to happen next. You think you understand what is going to happen but you don't. I absolutely love this movie its got a little bit of everything in it. It has all of the things that you could ever ask for in a good movie, famous actors, romance, a little comedy, the cocky young hot guy that you end up feeling sorry for, and a great plot. Above all the most intriguing thing about this movie was that it was true. The story wasn't something that Hollywood dreamed up with their vivid imaginations. No it is the real live story of a living breathing persons life growing up. I was so into the movie that I actually decided to do some research on Frank Abagnale Jr. and learn more about his real life as one of the greatest bank fraud men alive.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Entertaining throughout,43687,jansen-aui,17 June 2006,"Few directors can lay claim to as much diversity as Steven Spielberg  he's shown us every now and then with his ability to produce two films of starkly contrasting tone in the same calendar year. Most recently, 2005 saw Spielberg deliver the spectacular alien-invasion blockbuster War of the Worlds followed closely by the somber Best Picture nominee Munich. In 1993, it was the one-two punch of crowd-pleaser Jurassic Park and the uplifting Best Picture Schindler's List. 2002 was another year of achievement for Spielberg  after wowing audiences with the thought-provoking sci-fi thriller Minority Report, they were treated with the light-hearted, thoughtful, and endlessly fun Catch Me If You Can.

Set in the 1960's - in New York initially but spanning all the way out to France - Catch Me If You Can tells the tale (the film opens with ""inspired by a true story"") of Frank William Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fraudulent con artist who had successfully posed as a teacher, a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, stolen millions, and gotten away with it, all before his 19th birthday. Throughout the entire three-year episode, detective Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who gives determined chase, setting up a cat-and-mouse affair where Frank always seems to be a step ahead, but who more than once offers to give himself up to the agent he forms an interesting dependence on over time.

What seems a simple premise is taken beyond that by a clever script and assured direction. The two leads are cast wonderfully, DiCaprio as the youthful con artist who seems to revel in the thrill of just getting away with things but who can in a moment snap into loneliness and yearning, and Hanks as the all-too-serious agent who loves to mess with Frank's mind. The supporting cast, too, give excellent turns but it's Christopher Walken who stands out as Frank Sr.- his sad, unfulfilled eyes speak tomes of the emotional struggle he's been through and the shaft that the law has treated him with. If there's a failing with the picture, it's the pacing during the opening sequences which establish the context of Frank Jr.'s situation - they seem to slow and weigh the movie down a little before it even kicks off proper with Frank Jr.'s first con. The closing sequences, too, serve as an epilogue that's a little bit unnecessary - Spielberg could have easily finished the film ten minutes earlier and audiences would not have been any less satisfied.

It would be a shame to finish the review without touching on the technical aspects, and it's here that Janusz Kaminski's brilliant photography seems to glitter in gold, combining with excellent costuming and John Williams' score (inspired by 60's Sinatra hits and James Bond-style cues) to give a believable, immersive sense of period. Indeed, perhaps what makes Catch Me If You Can so effective is the supreme sense of amusement and fun it seems to have been made with, and that is something that's directly channeled on to the audience. There's no heavy, resonant story here that delivers an important message, but where Spielberg succeeds is in not trying to: it's a cop-and-crook flick that simply excels as entertainment, even if it's a tad on the long side for the scope of the story it covers.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch it if you can,43718,helen-115,16 June 2006,"Catch Me if You Can is a fun ride based on the true life adventures of Frank Abagnale Jr. who, starting at the ripe old age of 16, posed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer (actually passing the bar) and wrote over 4 million in phony checks by the time he was 19 years old. I have read Mr. Abagnale's book and it is truly an amazing story. The screenwriter did a very good job of turning what could have been just one escapade after another into a thoughtful story of a young, smart, highly sensitive boy who was traumatized by his parent's divorce. He ran away when forced to choose between his two parents, and got caught up in a web of deception which took on a life of its own. Spielberg had to leave a lot of the details of the story out of the movie in order to more fully explore the motivations of the characters. I think this made the movie more interesting and added a serious dimension to what otherwise might have been fluff. After Schlinder's List, I believe this is Spielberg's best film. Great acting by all, especially Christopher Walken. Wonderful cinematography. The set design & costumes envelop you in the '60's. Perhaps the real star of this film, however, is the original score by John Williams.....very sophisticated! In every way a real treat of a movie!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,As serious as a drama and as funny as a comedy,43687,matlefebvre20,4 June 2006,"According to me, biopics about little-known people are more interesting, because they're more surprising. Just before renting ""Catch Me If You Can"", I've never heard anything about Frank Abagnale Jr. Now, I know a lot of things...

Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man (in fact, not 20 years old yet) who discovered that he had a real talent of forging other people and to make money from it. And the story itself is not a forge, because it really happened. All of the elements presented in the movie are not necessarily true, but the majority is. The trueness of the story is simply incredible and hard to believe.

Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers a fairly splendid performance here. While he was in his late 20's during the filming, DiCaprio perfectly appears as a late teenage boy.

The other main character is FBI agent and fake checks specialist Carl Henratty, played by the incredible Tom Hanks. Henratty is the cat of the cat-and-mouse game and he personally runs after Abagnale on this wild ride in order to bring the kid to the justice. But the job isn't easy.

The main example is the famous hotel showdown. At this moment, Henratty only heard the Abagnale name and he doesn't have any sight of Abagnale's face. So, he meets Abagnale, but the young man acts like if he was an agent as well and Henratty falls into the trap. This situation is the funniest one in the entire movie.

Also highlighted must be Christopher Walken's performance as Abagnale's father.

There is no single mood into this movie. Sometimes, it is very dramatic and there are very special scenes. But it's also very comic and it surely is one of the lightest movies of Steven Spielberg's career as a director.

So, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is another jewel in Spielberg's filmography and so it is for DiCaprio and Hanks...",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,I absolutely loved this movie.,43748,tomcondelles,16 May 2006,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of my favorite Spielberg films, I found it to be absolutely intriguing to watch and have seen it three times.

I have written to Steven Spielberg and I am trying to find out how I can work in one of his films as a supporting actor or possibly meet him in Los Angeles. I think about Steven often and he is one of my Hollywood idols. He doesn't usually answer my letters to him at Universal.

CatchMeIfYouCan,St George School Melgoza,43687,lumelco,28 April 2006,"I like the film because it is similar to the true story but i would like to know if Frank got married and what happened with Brenda also what Happened with Carl's Life?

St George School Yasu I was enjoying this film. Carl try to catch up Frank but he can't do easily. Also Frank pretended to be a lawyer, a pilot and a teacher,make some frauds and keep escaping These scenes are most exciting in this film. It reflects not only humor but also passion.

St. George School Nelson Raul I think that the film was fine and very interesting. The FBI agent caught Frank and I like Frank's decision and the new type of life. Frank helped the FBI agent and he became a good person. The best part for me was the FBI agent attitude with Frank, many police agents must watch this film. Frank's father had a bad attitude to agree with his son life. Frank's mother has a bad decision her decision helped Frank to cheat a people. Thank you very much Nelson Raul",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Our point of view...from Mona Lisa @ London,43687,simone-dam,28 April 2006,"We enjoyed so much this film but not the end too.. We would like that Frank will continue to cheat everyone and he will continue to work as a lot of other work.. We 'd like to know what's happened to Brenda because after Frank left her at the Miami Airport we didn't have any information about her..Is she alive?? We think Carl had a special feeling for Frank and he would like to catch him only for his personal aim. But anyway was a great movie about the 60's and very realistic too. We think the worst character in the film is Frank's mother.. because she wanna only ""catch"" the richest men of the Rotary Club to have a lot of money to enjoy herself!! This is our comment!

Yours Sincerely

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch this if you can!,43687,Spuzzlightyear,17 April 2006,"The life of Frank Abignale is explored here rather excellently by Steven Spielberg and company. This is all about a expert cheque forger who scammed his way into jobs with Pan-Am, was a high ranking lawyer and doctor, and romanced countless women. After getting caught by ruthless F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty, Abignale wrote an outstanding memoir, which has been quite faithfully brought to the screen. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite great here as Abignale and Hanks is good as Hanratty. After watching it, reading the book and then watching it again, I feel the book is slightly better, as the movie leaves holes in subplots the movie alludes to, but doesn't explore further (like his time in jail, and his relations with the Pan-Am recruits, which, bizarrely in the movie, is just dropped, making me wonder what on earth it was there for). But these are just minor ""I've-read-the-book-neener-neener"" points, the movie absolutely stands on it's own as a totally enjoyable movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch the audience like Spielberg if you can (tv),43656,leplatypus,4 April 2006,"Spielberg is a real movieteller and his movies are always little jewels. Yes, he isn't alone and have excellent collaborators (actors, music, cinematography, editing,...) but others with the same starpower (no names for my safety...) do raspberries movies. As in warfare, a good general is first of all, a good leader of men.

Beginning ""Catch me"" with original credits very stylized & 60's, it is winning decision because you are always in the mood. Being a reader of the American Ads art-book, I feel all the flavors of this era, in the firework of colors, and the carefree spirit of the people.

And this is what I remember of this movie: the strength of freedom.

With courage, you can do everything, like Frank Jr. And if you are caught but the intention is pure, the fate would recognize it. And this justice is the same value for Spielberg from his first movie to its last: the family, the kids. On the fun side, everyone knows the love of Spielberg for planes, thus the choice for this particular story must have been evident for him.

That's why Spielberg is great: The fundamental philosophic message is always delivered with impeccable techniques and a sincere humanity. The circle is closed...",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Leo and the Hankster rules,43687,dominic1972,3 January 2006,"I watched 'Catch me if you can' and I really enjoyed it. I very rarely watch films any more because I seem to have a short attention span, but this one had me captivated. The most extraordinary thing is that it's based on true story. I'm not a fan of Leo usually, but he was very believable and the Hankster was great. Although, I was not overly impressed by the way he was initially portrayed as something of a buffoon, only to turn into this sensitive, caring kind of guy. What put me off watching the film originally was the trailer showing Leo surrounded by all the beautiful air stewardesses - this didn't give any clue as to the actual style of the film - how he arranged that was masterful. Throrougly recommended.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Never a Dull Moment,43687,Box Office,2 January 2006,"Catch Me If You Can hits all the right notes with its involved characters, fast paced story, and thrilling capture of history. It's a true story but you wouldn't know it from its high entertainment value complete with a mix of comedy, drama, and suspense.

Tom Hanks comes through again as the detective hot on Leonardo DiCaprio's trail. Both have a great on screen bond which makes the story even more touching.

This is really a great movie for many reasons. But judge it for yourself. Spielberg has done it again with Catch Me If You Can. Nicely done. 8/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,An excellent film,43748,rebeljenn,6 November 2005,"Catch Me If You Can' is a rare breed of film combining skill, history, adventure, and interesting characters. (And I don't give out 10-star ratings unless I personally love the film and think it could not have been done any better.)

'Catch Me if You Can' was similar to the 1950s and 1960s North By Northwest or Bond-style films. The acting is done very well, which is highly crucial to the film because it is a film about characters. Leonardo does an excellent job in a not-so-Leonardo-typical-role. A good job on this film in this type of role probably earned him the part of Huges in 'The Aviator.'

It is easy to get caught up in this film because of the good characterization and the wittiness of the events which lead him to jump around from place to place, creating this fantasy world and getting caught up in all of the lies. It is easy to feel sorry for him as much as to wish that he were caught and cured of his criminal past.

I would highly recommend this film because I think that there is something in it that will appeal to everyone. You may not appreciate it or enjoy it as much as I did, but I still think it is one of those films you will remember for years to come. Excellent. 10/10.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can - One Of Speilburg's Best,43687,naturenut,1 October 2005,"Catch Me If You Can is an absolutely fun film from the theme song to the adventures of Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abignale. The actors and characters are outstanding! Based on a true story of a con artist who couldn't handle the divorce of his parents, Leonardo DiCaprio breathes life again to the young Frank. Tom Hanks provide hilarity and a sternness to the plot as he and Leonardo provide perfect chemistry on the screen. Everything is perfectly set in it's time of the 1960s. From the airports to the clothes, the 60s are brought to life again. Steven Speilburg did a wonderful job, as well as the people who did props, clothes, and other items, bringing this picture to life. Comedy, romance, suspense, family, and the true art of bank fraud are brought forward in this remarkable film. With a shocking ending and sweet story line, this film definitely deserved more credit than it got. Watch it. You won't regret it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Enjoyable caper,43656,wheatdog,21 March 2005,"Catch Me If You Can' is a beautifully crafted caper from Spielberg. Featuring terrific performances from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken the film exudes quality from start to finish. The depicted time period is captured and expressed to perfection: the sets, cars and clothes are a joy to behold at times and you find yourself genuinely lost in Frank Abagnale JR.'s world of deception. The lighting is wonderful, all sunlight streaming through windows and half closed curtains, giving the film a timeless, fairytale look, perhaps serving as a metaphor for the make believe world of young Frank as he impersonates both a doctor and an airline pilot whilst conning America's banks out of millions of dollars through bogus cheques, all before his 18th birthday. The characters are fleshed out extremely well and the reasons behind Frank's descent into a life of crime are carefully illustrated and conscientiously referred to throughout the movie. I highly recommend 'Catch Me If You Can' as it is refreshing, well made and absorbing.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Hallelujah! Spielberg's back!,43748,Okonh0wp,23 June 2004,"In the crafty hands of Spielberg, a novel long having been considered as unintriguing, becomes an excellent piece of work. The autobiographical novel, written by Frank Abergnale, tells of a counterfeit-savvy teenager's three-year stint at eluding the FBI by posing as a pilot, doctor, and teacher in the 60s.

Abagnale's story, first published in 1980 was shopped around for weeks to studios before being picked up. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you'll have trouble thinking of it as unexciting. However, looking at it from a different angle, is a form of crime such as passing bad checks is nothing visually compelling and it doesn't lend itself well to base a whole movie about?

To this I credit Spielberg, who once again creates an exciting and fun movie, that families can get excited about seeing come holiday season. Spielberg, essentially, takes the stories and infuses it with a couple of familiar elements: a lost youth struggling with the abandonment of a father figure (or in this case, his actual father), as well as a cat-and-mouse chase. The former is something which we can relate to more than we consciously realize and the latter is something which adds suspense and fun to the story. The alienated youth theme has popped everywhere in Spielberg's movies, from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to AI and everywhere in between. At the same time, I wouldn't call Spielberg's work, unoriginal or recycled, since he mixes these motifs in different combinations with other dramatic elements and the story itself is quite fresh.

Quality seeps out of every element in the film, from its score and sets to its dialogue and acting. I never thought I'd ever hear myself say this years ago, but Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a great performance, shedding aside his `Who needs acting when I'm a sex-symbol' attitude of old, and immersing himself in the role with all the vulnerability, despair, and aptitude it entails. Tom Hanks, of course, matches up to DeCaprio, line by line, as Hanratty, the FBI investigator who chases him for three years. The relationship of mutual respect between the two, and eventual lifelong friendship, is truly heartwarming. In Hanks' interpretation of the part, there is not just mutual respect but frustration bordering on obsession, as he borrows a page from the inspector in Les Miserables. Christopher Walken also has a big role as the father, with whom DiCaprio's character is very close.

The film is not only a joy in itself but a positive sign in this new century that the work of a skilled storyteller such as Steven Speilberg can still hold up after all these years.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A great game of cat and mouse,43687,Smells_Like_Cheese,16 May 2004,"I was pretty surprised by ""Catch Me If You Can"". To tell the truth, I thought it was going to be pretty boring. But it was was really interesting. I loved Tom Hanks, he was so amazing in his role. He really took charge. And I was impressed with Leonardo's performance. I actually believed him as Frank. But I think any actor can be pushed to his or her limits, when put with the right director. And whom better than: MR. STEVEN SPEILBERG!

The movie in itself is wonderful. The cast is brilliant, and the story is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Good Fun; DiCaprio's Best Since ""Titanic""",43656,sddavis63,19 July 2003,"This movie earns a good rating if only for bringing to light the unbelievable and yet true story of Frank Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a young scam artist who bilked banks out of millions and who, having been captured and come clean, eventually put his talents to work in the other direction. If you can get through what I thought was an agonizingly boring animated sequence that runs during the opening credits (which seemed to go on forever) you'll enjoy this.

The movie is about Abagnale's criminal days, and takes the viewer on a roller coaster of situations which Abagnale manages to lie, swindle and cheat his way through, all the time being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks); thus the title of the movie. It's a fun story (particularly, I thought, his very first ""scam"" - as a student at a new school, he manages to convince people that he's a substitute French teacher and actually ""works"" in that capacity for 10 days until he's discovered!)

In my opinion, this is DiCaprio's best performance since ""Titanic."" I haven't been impressed with his work since, but here he really managed to become the character of Abagnale (much as he did with Dawson in ""Titanic"") rather than simply looking as though he were acting a part. He was clearly the star of the movie. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, quite surprisingly disappointed me a bit, and I would rarely say that about such a talented actor. Perhaps it was the part of Hanratty, but Hanks just didn't stand out to me. It seemed as though a hundred actors could have played the role without anything (except the name Tom Hanks) being lost. So, my normal expectations of the two stars were reversed here, which made the movie all the more interesting.

It's an enjoyable way to spend an evening.

7/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A film about the consequences of divorce,43626,Mort-31,3 April 2003,"There are two reasons which made me unable to enjoy this original and amusing story from A to Z. One is Leonardo DiCaprio, who, unfortunately, has the leading part in this film. He plays an 17-year-old boy who looks ten years older than he is, all right but he absolutely failed to convince me that he is really only 17. Sometimes he tries to play particularly `childish' in order to emphasize his real age but everything else  marrying, cheating, etc.  he does like Leonardo would do it, not like a minor whose parents got divorced (no matter how super-intelligent this minor may be).

The other problem is that this is a Steven Spielberg film. I was looking forward to see it because I thought maybe Spielberg has, for a change, chosen to tell a good-humoured story about a good-humoured sly fox in a good-humoured way. And I guess, any other director would have done so. But Spielberg would never get away from his crucial but corny theme: family. And he would make a family film out of every subject put in his hands. And this, in my opinion, harms the film very much. A movie based upon a true story can never be really true. So Spielberg had the chance to decide to skip famiy sentimentalities. But he didn't.

If you want to see a good film on family, watch The Royal Tenenbaums or the Danish documentary Family. If you want to see Catch Me If You Can, do so. It is really entertaining, brilliantly filmed and well acted by the whole cast with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. But do not be so naïve to give Steven Spielberg a second chance.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Crime doesn't pay! Unless of course you're really good at it...,43687,Shiva-11,25 December 2002,"People have always delighted in the exploits of those individuals that flout convention (and the occasional law) often living vicariously through them. How else can one explain the fascination with gentleman skyjacker DB Cooper, who, in 1971, jumped out of an airplane with a $200 000 ransom and vanished. No one  with the exception of law enforcement  wanted him to get caught. But next to Frank Abagnale Jr. Cooper looks like a piker - half a decade earlier, Abaganalemade off with a far greater sum with nothing more than chutzpah, fast-talking and a great smile. So what if he got caught?

Frank Abagnale Jr. learned early on that looks could be deceiving: his parents' fairy tale romance didn't include a `happily ever after' ending and although Frank Sr claimed to know the secret to success, it continued to elude him. Rather than be discouraged, Frank Jr. embraced these lessons and adopted deceit as his career, assuming the guise of doctor, lawyer, and pilot (among others). Not content to look like a jet setter, Frank embarked on global cheque bouncing spree to the tune of $2.5 million that earned him a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted List - quite a feat for a 17-year-old high school drop out.

Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr's dalliances with the law as a teen con man, `Catch Me If You Can' is both adventure and comedy with a touch of cynicism (the whole collapse-of-the-nuclear-family angle). The film has a bouncy, spirited soundtrack that supports and enhances the lightweight subject matter. This, along with wonderful set and costume design help to faithfully establish that sixties feel. Subtle scoring, fluid editing and tight camerawork ensure that the pacing is consistent and flows smoothly. This attention to detail is carried on by the cast.

This is the other Leonardo DiCaprio Christmas movie  the one with a modest budget, that wasn't years overdue, and didn't have everyone's tongue wagging about late night parties and blow-ups on the set. After solid work in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' and `The Basketball Diaries', DiCaprio became the flavor of the moment with `Titanic' (one of the most overrated movies of all time) and his credibility went into decline with roles in `The Beach' and the abysmal `Man in the Iron Mask'). I braced myself for the worst and was therefore pleasantly surprised with his performance in this film: DiCaprio carries the role of Frank Jr. with aplomb, infusing Frank with the perfect balance of charisma, ballsy impertinence, humor and when necessary, gravity (without resorting to the broody scowling we've seen before). His colleagues are no slouches either.

His role as the spectacled ubergeek in `Blast From the Past' notwithstanding, Christopher Walken's characters are best known for their villainous tendencies. As Frank Sr., Walken is decidedly under whelming, a pitiable dim shadow of a man who labours under delusions that salvation is just around the corner. Walken ensures that his character doesn't cross the line into useless pathetic, rather he exists as a cautionary tale to blind optimism. Equally understated, and yet simultaneously outstanding, is Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, Frank Jr's dogged FBI foil. Carl  a composite of several of the individuals who tracked Abagnale  is a quiet, determined loner who carries a few too many pounds and revels in the chase. Hanks brings the same quintessential every-man quality to the role that he is famous for, without looking like his character is a rehash from some other film.

This is one of those rare films that has virtually no swearing, violence or nudity (there are a few suggestive scenes) and yet doesn't moralize or try to drown the viewer in saccharine. In addition, it is fun, engaging, and well acted. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to be entertained.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Disconnected,43595,olethrosdc,6 September 2004,"The movie feels extremely disjoint. Three (counting the Xmas calls) years of Frank being tracked down compressed in less than two hours do not make for very exciting story telling. It is merely a case of Frank jumping from one role into another. His ability to act these roles proficiently is only tested once in each situation. However, a year in each of these roles would necessitate the construction of a more elaborate personality for Frank than what is depicted in the movie.

Some scenes seem to have been put into the movie without reason. For example, the whole set of scenes starting from the 'james bond of the skies' comment to the scene at room 3113 serve no purpose. Frank at another role. What does it tells other than that Frank likes role playing?

Overall it is somewhat enjoyable... but Frank's character is not interesting enough, despite its many transformations. The movie manages to take an interesting story and transform it into a purposeless mess.

Positive aspects: The music. Negative aspects: Ill-placed emphasis on the plot and bad pace.",neg

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Fantastic true-story, lousy movie",43565,moviebuffgirl,12 January 2003,"This fascinating story & fantastic cast are wasted in this sloppy self-indulgent slice of ""Shpielberg."" A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can,43687,jboothmillard,11 March 2005,"Director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) had charmed and affected audiences all over, but there was no sign of a film based on a true story, that is until this one came along. Basically FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is picking up his inmate from French prison, Frank Abagnale Jr. (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio), and through a series of flashbacks we see how he became the youngest and one of the most ruthless con-men in America. Hse has his mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) and father Frank Sr. (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Christopher Walken) separate, and just before turning nineteen, he runs away from home. He is determined to regain every penny that his father lost, and he successfully takes on many false identities in order to con his way to millions of dollars. In the process he passes as a history professor, airline pilot, a doctor and an assistant attorney general (lawyer). He also manages to have a one night stand with hooker Cheryl Ann (Jennifer Garner), before finding true (if that word can be used) love with nurse Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). Eventually his movements are being clocked by the FBI, led by Hanratty, who at one point comes face to face with his culprit, but he does get to him eventually. In the end, after many escapes and more attempts, Frank finally decides to stop, and finds a very good way to compensate by helping his now friend Carl catch other cons for the FBI. Also starring Martin Sheen as Roger Strong, James Brolin as Jack Barnes and Slither's Elizabeth Banks as Lucy. DiCaprio is fantastic as the young con, Hanks of course pulls his role off with ease, and Walken is a very good choice as the con's father, it is funny, moving and most watchable, a good fun biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Williams, and it nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, Christopher Walken number 34, and Tom Hanks number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",pos

This is the slowest movie I think I have ever seen. (My wife claims that only ""True Stories"" by the Talking Heads makes a better sleeping pill.) It is a good example of how a lot of talented people can get together and in a self-important moment design a mundane period piece that only artsy types would like. Except this trifle is not even artful. Part of the problem is the movie claims to be a ""secret agent man""-type thriller...but where you expect a Beatles concert you get ""That Thing You Do.""

CatchMeIfYouCan,Based on a real life story,43626,robert-710-767167,5 February 2011,"If this movie was entirely fictional, I would rate this a lot lower. But because there was an actual guy who did do what this movie portrays, I have thus decided that I'll rate this above half way.

Obviously you can't hide the facts. There are some inappropriate things that the character did in his life and the movie is just showing that. But because of my thoughts and opinions on that, I won't rate it as high.

But to do all of that before you are 21 and THEN work for the FBI, who were chasing your previously, is just big. So I rate this 6/10 because of the amazing truth of it.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,This Person Is My Hero....,43687,zabelardo,2 October 2007,"I have read the book, and find the movie delightfully entertaining. I love the fact this was based on a true story, and that Frank Abagnale Jr. was able to successfully beat our corrupt system at its' own game.

However, the movie omitted a lot of events the book detailed. Such as Abagnale being asked to fly the airliner briefly, while the pilot went to the lavatory. Good thing Frank knew better to switch on the autopilot, while he was away. And being asked to deliver a newborn baby, while posing as a doctor. He was very fortunate an experienced nurse was nearby, that day. Despite Spielberg's aversion to sexual matters- the book clearly places Abagnale's exploits with women nearing 50 encounters. I admire anybody who can live this way, and not catch anything.

Frank W. Abagnale, as a real-life pretender of sorts- illustrates what every young man's secret fantasy world craves; the ready ability to change and adapt to your surroundings. I applaud Abagnale's clever ability to ""socially engineer"" himself so convincingly, at such a young age. Frank's message to me was clear; dress like how you wanted to be treated. I envy the fact he got away with this kind of crime in a day where it was easily perpetrated, and hard to detect. Those days are long gone. What is still true to this day, is that if you look and skillfully act the part- you can still BS anybody, into doing virtually anything.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Great movie directed by Spielberg,43687,Argemaluco,14 December 2006,"Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker.He made false moves on his career and great movies.He made a lot of sci-fi films,historical dramas and he made some comedies.But his comedies(The Sugarland express,Hook,Always and 1941)were failures of critic and of popular opinion.They are the less known movies of his career and a lot of people forgot them.Maybe,they were too shallow or,simply,they were not funny.Catch me if you can is a comedy but it's way better than his other comedies and it had good popular opinion and critics and a lot of people know it and remember it.I have to say Catch me if you can is the best comedy of Spielberg's career.The best thing about this movie is that it is dynamic,interesting and very fun and funny.The script is very well written and the 141 minutes this movie has pass flying.Another great thing about this movie is that the film does not have a hero and a villain and I did not want to see one of the main characters as the loser.The ending is great.Leonardo Di Caprio is,no doubt,a great actor and here,he has a great performance.Tom Hanks makes an awesome performance,too.These two actors were ignored by the pathetic awards because they did not have serious roles but they deserved a nomination.The supporting cast is great,too but the best supporting performances are from Christopher Walken and Amy Adams.Walken is really perfect on his role and he had very well deserved Academy Award nomination and Adams has a role of teenager in love but she makes the character complex and memorable.Catch me if you can is a great movie.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Nyah, Nyah, you can't catch me",43687,bkoganbing,21 February 2006,"Catch Me If You Can should be seen back to back with Tony Curtis's performance in The Great Imposter. They are both excellent films and both deal with a protagonist who's a brilliant and charming fellow and a quick study who masquerades in many disguises.

In The Great Imposter the whole story is told from Tony Curtis's point of view. And it's more lighthearted in its treatment of Ferdinand Waldo Demara than this is of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Curtis's father Gary Merrill only has a few minutes in the beginning of The Great Imposter, but enough to establish the relationship there. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as son and father have a great deal more screen time together.

And of course in Catch Me If You Can we also have the point of view of the man trying to catch young Abegnale, FBI agent Tom Hanks. Remember this was the Sixties and J. Edgar Hoover was running the agency. Hanks is great as the uptight, buttondown agent in the Hoover mold. One of the best scenes in the film is DiCaprio conning Hanks out of an arrest by pretending to be a Secret Service Man and humiliating him in the process. He also turns Hanks into a man with a mission.

DiCaprio is a middle class kid from Westchester County whose father suffers some business reversals like Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. He refuses to accept a change in lifestyle and because he's bright, he develops into a master check forger. He masquerades as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor and steals millions of dollars and lives high on the hog. Another scene I like is DiCaprio entertaining a high class model at a five star hotel and then we cut to Hanks doing his laundry at some cheap laundromat.

Steven Spielberg allowed Walken to develop his father character a whole lot more than Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter. This man for whom the American Dream became a nightmare got a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

The Great Imposter with its accent on entertaining never allowed Tony Curtis to develop Demara's character as DiCaprio did with Abegnale. Basically DiCaprio finds it easy to con people because people do want to believe the best in you. Ironically he develops a telephone relationship with his pursuer in the same way Curtis had with his parish priest, Karl Malden. The reason is simple, Hanks is the only guy who knows what makes him tick. And in the end Hanks is the guy who provides a useful outlet for DiCaprio's talents.

I like the way Spielberg developed his characters in this film. We get good three dimensional portrayals from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken. It's a great film about another amazing adventure.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Polished, Light-Hearted Crime Thriller About A Con-Man Par Excellence",43626,ShootingShark,8 January 2006,"Frank Abagnale Junior is a teenager in New York State in the sixties, having trouble coping with his parents' impending divorce. He runs away and becomes a professional con-artist, posing as an airline pilot, a paediatrician and a lawyer, and scamming millions of dollars' worth of phony cashier's cheques. Eventually however, reality comes crashing in on him, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

This is an amazing true story about a consummate escape-artist, who crammed a lifetime of criminal adventure into his teenage years, paid the price for it, and started a second life on the other side of the law. It's hard not to like Frank, who genuinely seems to care about people, and whose obsession with stealing and fooling the authorities is more of a behavioural aberration than a desire to get rich quick. DiCaprio is iconic in the lead, with excellent support from Walken as his beleaguered father and Hanks as the workaholic Fed on his case. The charm of the picture comes from the ingenious and increasingly sophisticated methods Frank employs to commit his forgeries and realise his fictitious personalities. There is also a wonderful attention to detail in recreating the mid-sixties atmosphere, particularly in the groovy title sequence and the playfully tense Bernard Herrmann-style score by John Williams. A slick, enjoyable chase film, based on a book by the real Abagnale, who acted as a technical consultant and has a cameo as a French cop. Shot in California, New York and Ontario.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great fun.,43626,La Gremlin,30 May 2003,"""Catch Me if you Can"" is lots of fun for about the first hour and a half, and then it kind of runs out of energy. And this wouldn't be worth complaining about if there wasn't a whole hour left to go. This is still a very good movie, and it is worth watching. It is also the first movie in a very, very long time where there's nothing as memorable or imaginative in the movie itself as there is in the opening title sequence.

CatchMeIfYouCan,One Spielberg will want to forget,43565,SlimAdey,13 May 2005,"Tom Hanks, Leo Di Caprio, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Steven Spielberg - how can you go wrong? Very easily by all accounts watching this film.

After an hour and a half I couldn't wait for the credits.

I almost sunk into a coma when after 2 hours the film appeared to be ending only for it to drag on for another 20 minutes.

With some better editing and a more cohesive plot (rather than a sequence of scenes) this film could just about get away with it, if it ran for 90 minutes.

Unfortunately none of these apply.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.,43565,braddugg,8 September 2014,"Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.

Inspired by true story of the con man and runaway thief and fraud checker Frank Abagnale Jr. the story is really interesting in terms of how he disguised himself into so many professions, how many flaws are there in the system. How easy it is to become a pilot, doctor and even a lawyer, how worse are background checks in America and how spineless is FBI too. Now, all this was interesting premise and this is indeed a worth telling tale. Yet, Spielberg made this to a heroic tale of a famous man and how even he has a human side where he loves his parents and wants to be faithful to a girl he loved.

I didn't want him to be humane, I would have rather loved if he was lethal and brutal than he is actually shown to be. Tom Hanks here tried to make a fool of himself and I did not like it coz, he failed even failed to make a fool of himself and that's really sad, coz Tom is a fine actor and his acting did not show up here. The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio who does a fine job and the now superstar who was still a coming up actor in 2002, did show that he had the potential of making it big and his choices have made his career great. Leonardo as Frank comes with all guns blazing for whatever he is asked to do but I just wish his role was more cold blooded and cunning in despising himself and making merry with what goodies he gets.

The art direction seems to be fine, but soundtrack of Jazz caught my ears and that was some real good music and I loved the soundtrack. Now, cinematography is good too, yet this is over two hour two minute saga that loses steam by the end. I wish it had more pace and not as lethargic as it is. The supporting cast did their job well and Amy Adams was a really cute pie then and she has come a long way since then.

The writing had been a bit more crisper and the scissors been much more tight would have made this chase a delightful one, in a heist and chase movie, we do not expect drama but this loads of it, the father intervenes and the son-father relationship was not so much to my liking coz it was more of a clichéd thing than a fantasy one. The son keeps saying, dad I do this for you, I do that for you, now you and mom be happy. Ah, just cut the crap man.

Oh, did I go too harsh in criticizing this movie, yeah I would have coz this is a great film for few but not for me. For me this was kind of routine stuff from a director who made a distinction to himself of making movies or telling stories that are too very engrossing and make us move, be it a ET, Jurassic park or a Schindler's List. Now, Spielberg got down to this and it was an OK attempt not a great one though.

I am going with a 2/5 for an average movie from a great director and two of the very good actors we have around. This is what your bread and butter is, I need your gold and diamonds.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Another boy who makes believe,43595,tieman_64,7 August 2011,"""Spielberg is both politically backward (liberal, that is, rather than radical, reaching, humane) and, like his nut-job U.S. president, totally bereft of curiosity. [] He remains enraptured by respectability, orthodoxy and the status quo. It's doubtful that enlightenment will ever strike him."" - Dennis Grunes

Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"" opens with a stylised credit sequence, a homage to Saul Bass and the caper/con/heist/spy/Pink-Panther/Saint movie credits of the 1960s. What follows is Spielberg's version of Tony Curtis' ""The Great Imposter"" and Wendell Harris' ""Chameleon Street"", though here our hero is teen-aged con-man Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), an emotionally wounded kid who lies to others as a means of escaping the lies he tells himself.

All of Spielberg's pros and cons are on display. Moments of sexuality, romance and swearing ring awkward or false, the film's comedy is clunky, all female characters are whores, bimbos, nitwits or betrayers, the terrifying, darker aspects of ""real-life Frank"" are ignored and the film's last act is bloated. Spielberg cheats with some of the images as well, using postcard pictures, fancy clothes, an animated intro, chirpy music, cutesy nods to Truffaut and slick montages to convey an impression of either fun or loneliness. It's all very mechanical. A collection of references rather than anything substantial.

Though it aims for a breezy tone, the film's start-stop narrative is more a collection of vignettes. Spielberg's camera also rarely conveys a sense of true three dimensional space, and like ""Minority Report"", one is always aware that there is nothing, no space, no landscape, beyond the edges of each sound stage, each set-piece, each street corner or those blazing shafts of white light which seem to cordon off each sequence. Watch, for example, how small the film's street scenes are, or how closed off its airport sequences feel. With Spielberg, there's never anything beyond the set piece, a facet which he tried to rectify with ""The Terminal"" (where space and architecture become the lead character).

Still, there's a lot of great stuff on display. DiCaprio's fantasy world is infectious, Spielberg clearly having fun as DiCaprio does likewise. Forging cheques, playing make-believe, living a fantasy life, these are all things which appeal to Spielberg. The film's ""real human drama"" is also handled much better here than elsewhere in Spielberg's filmography, and unlike most con-man movies (""The Sting"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" etc), Spielberg always stresses the pain (see ""California Split"") underlying each of DiCaprio's flights into white-collar fantasy (though DiCaprio's victims are given no voice). This is the post ""A.I."" Spielberg, the film-maker increasingly suspicious of himself and his art.

If one ignores ""ET"", ""Catch Me"" is perhaps Spielberg's most autobiographical film (the director famously conned his way into, or rather conned us into believing that he conned his way into, a Universal Studios lot). All Spielberg's neuroses are presented (ie, a kid hiding in the fantasy world of cinema/con-artistry because his parents are divorcing), before the film eventually climaxes with Frank joining the FBI and using his powers of lying, forgery and imagination (aka his sweet film-making skills) for the ""greater good"" of America. The film then ends with title cards which inform us that Frank stopped thousands of criminals, raised a large family (all sons!) and became a millionaire by creating unforgeable cheques. It's Spielberg's own trajectory from little Jewish outcast to millionaire do-goods-man, his filmography untouchable, unforgeable, but built on lies and forgery.

Some cite the film as a critique of the ""American ethos"", white collar America, and the hollow drive to ""please the father"", ""get top jobs"" and ""be all you can be"". But what the film really exemplifies is Spielberg's brand of confused, liberal humanism. The film's French authorities may be brutally indifferent, but America lets Americans act out, then, like a good daddy, rehabilitates them and brings them back home. FBI agent Tom Hanks, Frank's surrogate daddy, is after-all not a big mean G-man, but just another wounded guy looking for a son of his own. If daddy and son work and dream together, everyone will prosper.

In this regard, Frank's motivations are completely ignored by Spielberg, who attribute them solely to ""divorce"". In reality, Frank's criminality stemmed from his father's own predicaments at the hands of the state (his inability to ""turn cream into butter"", as he says in the film), predicaments which led to real-life Frank noticing the disparity between America's economic reality and its empty promises of success through ""unceasing hard work"". What Spielberg's film does is bashfully circle around this truth before presenting the opposite. Here, Frank's flights aren't a means of debarring his father's problems but of overcompensating for his father's failings as a scheming businessman, failings which Frank believes caused his evil wench of a mother to leave daddy. Work hard, be smarter and cleverer than daddy, and mommy won't leave. But remember to do this within the boundaries of the state, the law, otherwise you won't make millions and have a cool job and big family. The film's goody-goody conservatism, which a better director would have pushed to parody, is epitomised by a series of conversations towards its ending when Frank reiterates that he ""didn't cheat"", that he ""studied and worked hard"" and ""passed all his bar exams"". In other-words, selfishly conning people only sidetracked our hard working, talented Frank from his true potential, from America's true ""rugged individualism"", true nature, and true work ethic. And if you do this as well, if you're an imaginative little guy who works within the boundaries like Frank/Spielberg, you too can be a zillion dollar high flier. Meanwhile, the film completely ignores the contempt con artists ordinarily have for their victims, for humanity in general, that pool of all-too-eager suckers.

7.9/10 – Worth three viewings. (This review has been repeatedly deleted by user ""bbarash"", a disgruntled Spielberg fan, for being ""offensive"". This is my backup account. Link to original account: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur4130201/comments )",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Well made, but romanticizing an evil, psychopathic criminal in this way is sick!",43626,bopdog,25 December 2002,"I'd always thought these ""pretender"" guys were in it for the thrill, the romance, the acting out of diverse roles, etc. That they loved the challenge, and that kind of thing. Didn't Tony Curtis play someone like that 30-40 years ago, also based on a true story? Anyway--- I was a bit surprised to find out that the Leo DiCaprio character was a criminal--- a thief, a forger, a rip-off artist merely in it for the cash. As he was portrayed in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" he seemed psychopathic, cruel and fundamentally evil.

This movie is unquestionably well-made. DiCaprio has displayed admirable maturity and power as an actor--- he no longer looks like a girl. he actually resembles a young Johnny Depp (and that's a good thing). Tom Hanks is also typically great. The 60s period setting is all good. But what I saw on the screen was a lot of innocent people having their lives ruined, in both big and some small ways: The would-be stewardesses who were humiliat ed, the fiance was unnecessarily hurt, her father was abused--- and why? What did those people do that made it OK for the movie audience to laugh out loud at their pain? The people who lost the $4 million dollars ($15 million in today's money), the various folks whose jobs were threatened, etc. How many families lost their income? How many elderly people suddenly could not retire as planned, but had to crawl off, unwanted, to some corner to die?

Part of this movie wants us to somehow cheer for the Abagnale guy, to somehow ""see through his flaws"" and yet love him anyway. Bulls***! Based on what the movie showed, he was a horrible, evil little vampire. Hurting, destroying, crapping all over decent folks. His victims weren't even guilty of that old cliche rationale movie con-men have so often used, that they were trying to gain unfair advantage themselves--- no, the victims had done nothing wrong. They were not ""up to anything."" They were merely trusting others, and being loving.

For this reason, this otherwise very good Speilberg effort was a bit disgusting. Movies over the years such as ""Fitzwilly,"" ""The Sting,"" ""The Flim-Flam Man,"" and ""Paper Moon"" all romanticize and celebrate evil, because they all make light of thieves and seducers. But think about the people they hurt, the people they destroy--- somehow the victims are always forgotten in that Disneyesque focus on the cute little heroes. I'm sorry Steven, but the subject matter of this movie has gone too far. If you want to make a movie about Charles Manson the monster--- fine. I won't watch it, but at least the movie would be honest. To have made this movie about ""Frank Abagnale The Cute Misunderstood Thief Who Is Really A Romantic Hero"" is sick.",neg

CatchMeIfYouCan,Not Mr Spielberg's best by a long way,43534,perkypops,16 May 2011,"Good films generally have good stories which have been rewritten as great screenplays. This film's screenplay fails to live up to the story it retells. Any film portraying the hero/villain (Frank Jnr) as a contestant in a game show as a first take has a lot of ground to make up before it ends.

There is a hollowness in this film which begins with the tale of the two mice who fell into a bucket full of cream, because I thought only one of the mice was honest and, by the end of the film, I knew I was right. There is a nastiness in this film which is apparent via the targeting of the female bank clerks and others for trickster game playing during the film. The scams actually do harm people along the way although we are not credited with enough intelligence by Mr Spielberg of what that harm may be.

We have an unlikeable character for the alternative hero/villain (Hanks's FBI investigator Hanratty) who is not allowed to show any redeeming quality at all, except for a crafty swipe at Frank Jnr whenever he can, and doesn't the lad deserve it? We even have characters playing 'suspicious minds' just in case we lose sympathy with Frank Jnr's game playing, but, unlike Hanratty, they are actually mostly clueless. And any who aren't clueless seemingly don't get a mention in case it spoils the plot. So what may have been a very believable book is not a believable screenplay.

The acting is patchy. I enjoyed Frank Jnr's parents doing their thing, and, mildly speaking, Amy Adams's Brenda, but that is about it. The rest were just not very convincing at all.

So definitely not Spielberg's best and if you'd like to see the man at consummate ease with his medium spend your money on a re-run of ""Duel"" which is still my favourite Spielberg film.

3/10 because it is overlong and I wasn't entertained.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Too much Edulcorant, Mr. Spielberg",43626,billion_mucks,12 November 2007,"I saw the movie twice, and the first one dazzled me with a premise that basically is a constant run and some fun in coning. Di Caprio is outgoing and charming. Everyone else is like publicity, you know it's there but you don't take them in account. Except Christopher Walken, who is Superb.

At second viewing, three years later, I remembered only pieces, and was bored to death. The settings are urban boring and the action is heterogeneous but unimpressive. I think Spielberg rooted to make the story of the con man too sweet, to make him infantile and reachable phsycologically. I didn't like that approach being the character in real life a lot more interesting, obscure and harder. Tom Hanks character Hanratty tries to be smart at all times, guessing and boring, tires with his pseudo-hero role.

All of the movie tries to make what would be an interesting, edgy film into a bedtime story, sweetened by all filmical elements (actings, directing, lights, script). Im sure you will like it, because you want a smile on your face. But I sure do enjoy stories like these being much darker, much more intrinsically approached and a lot deeper. A nice try though, Spielberg. Im still a big fan of you.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Lot of Money Spent on a Slight Story,43595,noralee,22 December 2005,"Is ""Catch Me If You Can"" an indicator of the end of Western civilization? How to justify the enormous amount of money and talent that went into creating a slight entertainment with zero significance? As my son pointed out -- the idea was to make a profit and they doubtless are.

The cleverly done details overwhelm the substance, almost hiding the lack of any.

The opening credits by Nexus Productions are a marvelous salute to similar animated openings, like ""The Pink Panther"" and ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" period classics by noted graphic designers like Saul Bass.

John Williams captures the Mancini feel of ""Peter Gunn"" etc. with the finger clicking accompaniment to the opener.

The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, costumes and art direction stunningly continue the period feel, as well as expensive use of appropriate songs like ""Look of Love,"" so we really do see all the money on the screen. Because Steven Spielberg doesn't spend $1,000 where he can spend $100,000. The camera is constantly moving back to reveal huge, decorated sets, and swooping around to show us just how much environment has been re-created.

This is to Spielberg's oeuvre what ""Ocean's 11"" is to Steven Soderbergh's. It feels like Spielberg was trying to do a tribute to Billy Wilder, without the cynicism that he simply can't do, but the film is dedicated at the end to the late Bruce Paltrow. Wilder would never see family deterioration and recreation as a motivator as Spielberg does, with a recurring theme of Christmas Eve reunions, complete with a wide-eyed little girl (with a similar divorce propulsion as in ""E.T."").

Leonardo DiCaprio is much better cast here than ""Gangs of New York"" as a protean teen-ager, while Tom Hanks is his usual obsessively dedicated employee. Christopher Walken is marvelous in a small, fatherly role and even gets to dance very briefly.

But I kept wondering whether this story would have held up as a little indie film and decided it would not without the gloss.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Poorly paced but in places enjoyable,43565,categreen2000,2 February 2003,"Maybe I've been watching another film to some of the other people on IMDb, or perhaps it's because I've been having my own little classic movie fest over the past two days (with THE BIG SLEEP, THE THIRD MAN, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS etc). Whatever the case, I was decidedly underwhelmed by Spielberg's latest offering.

The cinematography was very pleasing, Leo did a good job, the period detail was all there, there was some nice use of music (though not nearly as much as I was expecting) and there were some brilliant, laugh-out-loud sequences but... it just didn't work for me. The film's pacing was all wrong IMHO: far too slow at the beginning and between every major con; by the half-way point I was clock-watching, something I very, very rarely do in the movies. Usually I get very easily sucked into a film but in this case I just wasn't. Oh, well, my loss I guess. In terms of rating, the film gets points for craftmanship but is dragged down by the pacing and Hank's phoned-in performance to a straight average mark of 5/10",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me Not,43565,Niro,31 December 2002,"You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway).

""Minority Report"" has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC ""care"" -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit.

A word of advice: don't watch ""The Grifters"" (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of ""The Sting.""

Hell, don't even see the underrated ""Harry in Your Pocket"" or even ""The Flim-Flam Man"" before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$.

Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see ""A.I."" or ""Minority Report.""

And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in ""Thirteen Days"" (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's ""Road to Perdition"" is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod).

Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene.

The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think ""Pink Panther"" flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's ""Ocean's Eleven"" sans the cool.

Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly ""what's she doing here?"" cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival).

Though ""based on actual events,"" several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont.

By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?).

But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history.

Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, ""The Great Impostor"" -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well.

Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE.

Catch it not.

But *do* rent ""The Grifters.""

Or ""Ocean's Eleven""... even the original. No wait -- stick with the *other* Steven's version ;)

4/10 Out",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Why? Can anyone tell me why?,43475,sugar_daddyo,9 April 2006,"Why is it that Leo always gets these roles that cast him as a suave, debonair ladies man from books such as the Beach and now Catch Me if You Can?

I actually read this book fifteen years ago as a fifth grade autobiography project. What I do remember is that Frank Abagnale stressed that he was able to accomplish his feats because he looked ten years older than he actually was. Yet you have the reverse with Leo. Can anyone tell me why?

It is almost as if Steven Spielberg recognized the moral vacuum of this film and looked to Leo as some sort of insurance.

I did find one chuckle. I was ten years old when Frank Abagnale managed to capture my attention by his bamboozling, and now Leo seems to have stepped squarely into Frank's shoes. Way to go Leo!

Please go watch something else, anything else, except for The Beach.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Hank's Worst Movie!,43475,asadek7,8 January 2003,"Maybe this is the worst movie for Tom Hanks...

In other words...It's the first bad movie for Tom Hanks.... as Usual..Steven Spielberg ruins the movie as he did with Minority Report and he turns out the actors into machines and takes away their ability to show us the great emotions and drama ...that's what he did with Tom Cruise and this time with the other great Tom....Hanks

Spielberg turned him to a lousy F.B.I agent with no creativeness at all..doing just his boring job to catch a boring kid and for what ?..to work in the next office to him in the end in the same boring job. that's it

Spielberg turned the great actors to machines-like and ruined the whole beautiful emotionable story..

so I don't think this movie is gonna win anything in the Oscar and I think it's a great chance for Tom Hanks to start thinking again about his Old movies and to try to get his high level back in the future...",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,How director/actors ruin a beautiful script,43475,apioneer,7 June 2005,"I heard a lot about this film.I saw it today and thought it was a brilliant script and how the big name director and star actors ruined a beautiful script.This film was about brilliant characters of Frank and his father which should have been played in a unique way not just plain ,the way Martin Sheen and Leonardo played them.Tom Hanks looked like a stupid who could not capture a victim who is right in front of him like four times.Can you imagine that FBI would act like that and let the guy run around like that??? Leonardo, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner were more concerned about what they are wearing and how they look rather than getting into depths of these wonderful characters. It was not a comedy as I read the script and Spielberg could not get the script and just made it a plain movie .Give this film to British directors and actors and see what a wonderful classic film they will make out of it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch Me If You Can,43687,darya_rus,19 February 2019,"At first glance, I can say that the film ""Catch Me If You Can"" by Steven Spielberg is a classic film that does not claim for high awards and a dominant place in the history of cinematograph. But after the first, second and third viewing it becomes clear that the creators, without even waiting for it, created a truly exciting and unique movie. This is not an entertaining film for the general public, this is a film-story for a thoughtful and curious viewer. The film ""Catch Me If You Can"" is not intended to tell the viewer any thoughtful story with a global human problem. We see the story of a schoolboy, a minor American teenager, who at such a young age managed to be a representative of a wide variety of professions: an airline pilot, a qualified doctor, a lawyer. In his spare time, he fell in love with forging bank checks, thanks to which he managed to save up impressive multimillion-dollar capital. But the FBI agents get involved in the chase of a young swindler. The plot of the film is a powerful and intriguing embodiment of a true story by means of cinematograph. The main goal of the film was to tell in a dynamic form the most interesting situations that took place in the investigation of the case of Frank Abagnale. Steven Spielberg has proved himself as a powerful and professional film director. In my opinion, he is the very film director who can combine together absolutely contradictory genres. The whole atmosphere is focused on the chase, on the feelings of the persecuted and the pursuer. A lot of funny and humorous moments, embellishing in all a dramatic picture, allow viewers to relax while watching. Steven Spielberg created a light comedy - dramatic film and while watching it you fully immersed in the developing events and directly take part in them. The actor's game contributed its positive mite to the overall concept of the film, without which, probably, it would not have had half of its success. First of all, I should say that Leonardo DiCaprio, for his then-young age, coped well with his role. He looks like an inquisitive young man who wears various masks. For him, the occupation of a scam is a hobby that absorbed him completely. Through the actor's talent, this image looks convincing and memorable. I would like to mention the wonderful work of Amy Adams, who, although she appeared in a cameo role, however, was able to attract the attention of the audience. The actress completely reincarnated, and this role became not similar to the rest of her ones in her career. Tom Hanks does not look like a boy against the background of the young actors I have mentioned. His character looks funny and energetic against the background of realistic fret and other emotions accompanying this feeling. In conclusion, I want to say that ""Catch Me If You Can"" is an exciting and dynamic film about financial scams that don't get bored during the rather long timeline and leave a wonderful mood with their bright and positive atmosphere.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg At His Finest,43687,dankyfrank,20 October 2018,"Catch Me If You Can is truly excellent. The cinematography and direction were near perfect, and the witty dialog and characters make this film one of the most entertaining Spielberg films of all time.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Great film that's based on a true story.,43656,FilmRaider,4 August 2018,"I usually don't watch movies like this. I decided to give it try, and I enjoyed it a lot actually. It has a pretty talented cast behind it : directed by Steven Spielberg, starring a younger Leonardo Dicaprio, and having Tom Hanks play the antagonist of the film (Which I think might be the first time), they all do a good job. One thing I think I will congratulate this movie on though is the emotional scenes, because actually have..well, Emotion in them, they seem real. Overall I think this was a really good movie but it might be a bit lengthy for some people.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Wonderful Walken Steals Every Scene,43687,slightlymad22,1 August 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to Catch Me If You Can.

I don't think this is a great movie, but it is a very entertaining one, carried by three great performances. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers a great performance, Tom Hanks is his usual reliable self, even if his accent wobbles at times, but it's the wonderful Christopher Walken who steals every scene he is in, and whilst he is not in it a lot, his presence looms large.

It seems as if it is over long, as it gets a bit repetitive at times, but it is never boring and whilst it is full of the Spielberg trademarks, some are switched on their heads.

In a year dominated by Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man and Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Men In Black and Austin Powers sequels, Catch Me If You Can, grossed $164 million at the domestic box office, to end 2002 as the 11th highest grossing movie of the year.",pos

CatchMeIfYouCan,"""They're never going to catch you, Frank.""",43656,classicsoncall,30 November 2017,"Well, I've seen the movie but I still can't believe how a teenager pulled off the stunts that Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio) got away with. It's probably a good reflection of how clueless society must have been in the Sixties, a time when I was in high school myself. Frank Jr. had a pretty good role model for his conniving ways in the person of his father (Christopher Walken). I guess you could say like father, like son in this instance, although DiCaprio's character took it to the nth degree impersonating an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer.

Obviously one can't doubt that a lot of this chicanery went on in the life of the real Abagnale Jr., but the picture is very much a superficial glossing over about what the guy got away with, for the amount of time he got away with it. As the detective hot on Abagnale's trail, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) starts the picture out as something of a caricature of the bumbling FBI agent that gets suckered when he first meets up with his quarry, but eventually settles into his role as the responsible guy who brought the faker to justice.

What I would like to have seen was some closure to the opening scene that had the 'To Tell the Truth' tease. That looked like a real clip of Dorothy Kilgallen asking a question, and it would have been cool if the film makers had used the rest of it to show the real Frank Abagnale, Jr. Instead, and I found this to be a fascinating piece of trivia, the real Frank Abagnale Jr. appeared in the movie as a French policeman taking DiCaprio into custody. So I guess you can add 'actor' to the list of his other dubious aliases.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch it,43534,studioAT,24 June 2017,"Spielberg/ Decaprio/Hanks - just those three names alone are enticing enough to get viewers into cinemas to watch this film, based on true life events.

I can't fault this film. It's entertaining, it's well performed and well directed (of course!), but it just didn't grab me in the same way my favourite films do. Perhaps I found it hard to root for a character who is clearly breaking the law, I don't know.

I would recommend it though, because it's a pacy, fun film that is entertaining enough.

It just sadly didn't do much for me.

CatchMeIfYouCan,An Entertaining Period Piece Based On A True Story,43687,zkonedog,7 March 2017,"Usually, movies of this day and age are separated into two distinct classes. There are those that ""make you think"", and then those at which you just ""sit back and enjoy the show"". ""Catch Me If You Can"" manages to combine a little bit of both of those strategies in order to create an excellent little period piece that will almost completely absorb you into all its little nooks and crannies.

For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio), who at the age of 17 breaks away from his divorcing parents (played by Christopher Walken & Nathalie Baye) and becomes a sort of grand impersonator. By specializing in forging checks and projecting the utmost of confidence, Frank becomes an airline co-pilot, a doctor, & and lawyer during the 1960s...without the credentials for any of those positions! While defrauding multiple institutions as well as the U.S. government, Frank is pursued by agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is continually astounded by the kinds of things that the young Abagnale is able to get away with.

There are three primary ways in which this film becomes very much a classic upon first viewing...

First, it is an incredible ""period piece"" dealing with the 1969s. The clothes, decor, attitudes, music, & personalities of the decade are very convincing and will make you feel as if you were actually transported back in time.

Second, the story is engrossing, compelling, and will have you thinking about its multiple themes the whole way through. Frank Jr. is not just a cardboard-cutout character...he is given the same contradictions that we all have, both good and bad.

Finally, the acting is tremendous. DiCaprio steals the show pretty much from beginning to end, while Hanks is his typical solid self. Smaller roles from Walken & Amy Adams are also very interesting and well-played.

Overall, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a fun little romp through the 1960s that (per the usual with a Steven Spielberg production) is very well-rounded and contains something for everybody. My exact rating would be 4.5 stars, as it truly will transport you away from the world for the entire runtime.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,World of fake,43687,noitidart,10 January 2017,"A guy in this world generates fake stuff to fake a fake society. Jailed for fake reasons and released for fake reasons.

Of all the forgers, he gets a chance to help catch and live outside of prison. Why him? Why not every forger? Fake selection. Fake justice. Made up laws, and bind people by it.

It's a good movie to show this is a world of fake. Get name and fame and cash, go to Harvard, Berkely, be a doctor be a lawyer. Fake fake fake. The ending, Hanks says, live the lie. If DiCaprio knows that why put 3 more sons into a world of lies. Now they have to live a lie. Did he think he now has so much money its not an issue?

I gave it a rating of 8 as at time of rating it was 8 and I didn't want to change that. It's very watchable. I re-watched it after years. It's a great movie even though I'm very mixed about it. If the actual rating was 10 at the time of rating this I would have rated it a 10. Fake.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,another masterpiece of Steven Spielberg,43687,gorfis666,15 November 2016,"This movie is in the top 250 list, so I thought that it's a must see movie, also, Leonardo DiCaprio plays the main character, which helped me to made my mind. And I didn't regret watching it. The move is simple, easy to watch, however, the story is extremely interesting. The cast is absolutely amazing, every single character played their role almost flawless. Since it's based on the true story, the script was written very well and even thought the movie was a bit too long, it was not boring at all and it kept me wanting and I was excited to see what other thing Frank (DiCaprio's character) is going to fake next. It's another masterpiece of Steven Spielberg and it's definitely in that list of movies which you must see in your lifetime.

CatchMeIfYouCan,AMAZING TRUE story with SPIRITUAL CHOICE,43687,jacklyn_lo,12 June 2016,"The actors Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio have been playing protagonists so naturally as if they were that characters themselves!

I like the very beginning. TV watchers supposed to find out a true Frank among three men. I especially enjoyed the question from the interviewer regarding a CHOICE. The question has been addressed to the first Frank, the fake one.

Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg decided to address to a real Frank a NEW question and missed an opportunity to make the play stronger by giving a ""chance"" to answer: "" I didn't have any choice.""

By answering that, the real Frank would have gained an extra dose of mystery, which is always good for a thriller, and he might have also gotten some additional sympathy from the audience. In short, it would have added a few cents to the character development.

That answer would have been a powerful attention grabber for the watchers, who would be waiting for an explanation, and the interpretation would come through the story itself.

Now, why didn't the real Frank have any choice?

This is what we see in the movie:

The boy was thrown into turmoil due to the divorce of his beloved parents. Thrashing between mom and dad, Frank, to avoid an emotional storm, runs away from both of them. After this point, he has been pushed to do what he could for survival, without being given any choice. The teenage boy started to face the cruelty of the materialistic reality - each independent step is costing MONEY.

Already, before his parents' divorce, we observe that Frank had a high self- defense ""mechanism"" – episode of his transformation into a school-teacher.

Using the inheritance from his father – the ""mice pray"" and the empty bank checks, Frank, thanks to his cleverness, is gaining success, ensuring his physical and emotional survival.

As a matter of fact, he faces a real CHOICE and hesitation of a decision in the end of the movie. Frank is supposed to decide - whether to continue with the FBI or to shift to the illegal ""free style"" life.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Main character inspires no empathy & no condemnation,43565,christinetoussaintemorro,2 March 2015,"This film tells the story of a thief and con man between the ages of 15 and 21. It doesn't stick closely to the real story of his life but takes many liberties with the narrative. It makes him an only child instead of showing his three siblings and changes the timeline so that he does his first major theft and confidence tricks at the age of 16.

It is told in a value-neutral way so that you can't admire him for his schemes nor condemn him for his wrongdoing either. You don't care enough about the character to admire or condemn him. He is simply a 'phenomenon'.

The actor Lenny D is adequate in the role. He never puts a foot wrong but doesn't stand out either.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"A Simple, Financially Escapist Fantasy That's Lighter Fare Than Most Spielberg Efforts",43626,drqshadow-reviews,13 October 2014,"Lean, flirty material that lacks the emotional punch I've come to expect from Spielberg's direction. Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo. Satisfying at times, especially when it's inspecting the hard work and tireless attention to detail that's essential to such dirty work (not to mention the rewards), it whiffs on any aspirations to challenge grander themes.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Teen-age Con Man,43748,Desertman84,9 January 2012,"A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story in this film entitled,Catch Me If You Can.It is a biographical comedy-drama film based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so skillful that the FBI eventually turned to him for help in catching other check forgers.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale and Tom Hanks along with Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye.

Frank W. Abagnale Jr. is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula, leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr., after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty , an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong, a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA.The scene then flashes forward to a plane returning Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Consumed with grief, Frank escapes from the plane and goes back to his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl that Frank realizes is his half- sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, to which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him.On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet appeared at work. However, Frank finally shows up and they discuss their next case.The ending credits reveal that Frank has been happily married for 26 years, has three sons, lives in the Midwest, is still good friends with Carl, has caught some of the world's most elusive money forgers, and earns millions of dollars each year because of his work creating unforgeable checks.

Steven Spielberg turns in another hit, with help from a strong performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, in this stylish, breezily entertaining, and surprisingly sweet story of real-life wunderkind con artist Frank Abagnale.It was a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices.Also,it was an excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted.In summary,the movie works at all levels.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,A Masterpiece!,43748,namashi_1,18 December 2011,"Catch Me If You Can' is a Cinematic Masterstroke. A Stunning Film, that doesn't lose your attention for even a minute. Steven Spielberg delivers one of his finest films in 'Catch Me If You Can'! And The Performances, are WOW!

'Catch Me If You Can' is based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor.

Bringing the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr. on celluloid is not an easy job. Abagnale, Jr. in his prime was a man who had a vision many didn't. He had the talent & skill many aren't blessed with. His notorious yet adventurous journey, luckily, unfolds, brilliantly in here. Even cinematically, Abagnale, Jr.'s Life turns out to be one hell of a roller-coaster ride!

Steven Spielberg's Direction, is Marvelous. He handles this journey with amazing ease & excitement. He creates a puzzle, which he solves eventually, and he solves it strikingly. Jeff Nathanson's Adapted Screenplay is amazingly entertaining. Cinematography by Janusz Kamiński, is stupendous. Editing is sharp. Music by John Williams, is excellent. Art & Costume Design, are worth a mention.

Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio gives a mesmerizing performance as Abagnale, Jr. The Actor embodies the Genius & Carries the film on his shoulders. Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent who pursues Frank for most of the film, is extra-ordinary, like always. Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., is quite astonishing. Martin Sheen is first-rate, while Amy Adams proves her caliber yet again. Nathalie Baye is effective. James Brolin does his bit well. Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo & Elizabeth Banks are noticeable in cameos.

On the whole, 'Catch Me If You Can' is A Masterpiece! This is what Cinema is all about!",pos

All of the actors did their best in my opinion, and everyone scintillated in their own specific way, especially the main protagonist, whose charm and intelligence impressed me.

I honestly think that this movie has it all. It's unique, exciting(especially its myriad amount of unique humorous scenes), original, and it's based on a true story. It will satisfy even the snobbiest filmophile. I wholeheartedly recommend you this masterpiece.

CatchMeIfYouCan,"OK, but my least favorite (and most overrated) Spielberg film",43626,kdnor2011,19 June 2011,"I'm normally not one who likes movies based on true stories, there are some that I like, but for the most part I just couldn't care less. However Steven Spielberg made one that I truly liked under the name of ""Shindler's List."" So if there was one person who can make a great movie based on a true story it would be him. Well, unfortunately, ""Catch me if you Can,"" is not only Spielberg's most overrated movie, but his worst film to date. Now keep in mind that there are some that I haven't seen, like 1941, which is considered his worst.

The reason I really don't think this movie is that great, is that it just isn't that interesting to me. This was praised as a hugely entertaining chase film, and at times it is, but for the most part its just not interesting.

Is it bad, no. The acting is top notch, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio do very good jobs here. And there were no plot holes, at least from what I saw.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,What a great movie,43748,madiso08,19 March 2011,"WARNING THIS REVIEW INCLUDES A SPOILER Catch Me If You Can is inspired by the young teenage con artist and master of deception Frank Abagnale Jr. played by actor Leonard DiCaprio. This movie is about the relentless pursuit of Frank Jr. by FBI agent Carl Hanratty played by actor Tom Hanks. The movie starts out by showing sixteen year old Frank Jr. living a good life with his father Frank Sr. played by actor Christopher Walken and his mother Paula played by actress Nathalie Baye. The family runs into some financial issues because Frank Sr. owed the IRS money. Due to the financial issues the family had to move out of their house to an apartment. Paula cannot deal with all of the changes and begins having an affair with one of Frank's close friends played by James Brolin. Frank Sr. and Paula end up getting a divorce and Frank Jr. had to move a choice of which parent he wanted to live with but instead of choosing Frank Jr. ran away.

After Frank Jr. ran out of money he begins to try and cash bad checks at all of the banks. Frank Jr. quickly moves up the criminal chain when he starts impersonating an airline pilot. He also starts making fake Pan Am payroll checks. This is when Carl begins to start chasing Frank Jr. It was a long chase for Carl but he never gave up. Frank went from being a pilot to a doctor, a doctor to a lawyer, and even managed to fall in love with a girl named Brenda played by Amy Adams. The chase eventually came to an end when Carl found Frank Jr. and he decided to give up. Frank Jr. was so good at check forgery that the FBI decided to eliminate his jail sentence as long as he would work for the FBI in their fraudulent check department.

In my opinion the theme is no matter how long you run the things you do in your past will catch up with you and you will have to deal with the consequences. The obvious example is the main character Frank Jr. getting caught and sentenced for all the crimes he committed. Another example is Frank Sr. was committing fraud on his taxes. This caught up with him and caused him to lose all of his worldly things and his family. Finally Paula was having an affair and tried to keep it a secret but it caught up with her because the affair broke up her home which in turn caused Frank Jr. to run away. I feel like this theme could be applied to many other movies. For example The Cider House Rules, Roses father was having sex with her and he also attempted to keep it a secret. He even denied having sex with her when questioned about it. This eventually caught up to him to because he got Rose pregnant.

The movie is mainly shot from an objective point of view and the lighting is mainly high-key lighting, except when Frank Jr. was in prison (the lighting was darker). The lighting really ties in with the theme of the movie. When Frank Jr. was free and living life the lighting was bright but when he finally got caught the lighting was darker.

I must say I truly enjoyed this movie. Not only does the theme teach a lesson but the acting was great and the movie kept my attention the whole time. I give it two thumbs up!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Terrific Story of Real-Life Con-Artist and Impersonator Frank Abagnale Jr. Lived by ""If You Can't Beat 'Em Join 'Em"": DeCaprio's Finest Performance",43748,classicalsteve,19 January 2011,"Unlike most criminals, we all tend to like con artists or ""confidence men"". Con artists have to be likable, and they have to be so convincing that ""being taken"" never enters your mind. The perfect con is one where the mark never realizes he or she has been had. Frank Abagnale Jr. was one smart and likable kid who realized early on that a lot of decisions are often based on artificial perceptions which may have nothing to do with reality. If you lay in front of people certain visual clues which play into people's preconceived notions, including their prejudices (which can be sometimes positive), you can steer people into a particular understanding which may have nothing to do with reality. Abagnale decided to test this idea by dressing as an airline pilot. And it worked; he found that simply wearing the uniform convinced people he was an airline pilot, and therefore trustworthy.

After his parents divorce, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home and has to figure out how he can make a living. He learns how to forge cheques, but he can't get anyone to take his cheque since they don't ""know him"". He has no luck until he sees some airline pilots with their entourage of beautiful stewardesses, all in Pan Am regalia. In their uniforms, airline pilots appear to be the equivalent of nobility, with people staring in wonder as they pass by. In the 1960's, people had an idealized perception of airline pilots as honest and even heroic, a kind of positive prejudice. If Abagnale could project the illusion of being an airline pilot, he might be given carte blanche to cash his forged cheques. Why not join the party? It's even better than donning a Superman outfit.

Through some ingenious maneuvering, Abagnale acquires a uniform and an ID card to pass himself off as a co-pilot for Pan Am. What he finds is much more than he bargained for. By simply wearing his uniform and carrying a forged ID card, Abagnale opens bank accounts, flies on airlines for free, even gets free room and board at the expense of the airline. And he's cashing millions of dollars worth of Pan Am cheques. Everything seems to be going his way until the feds pick up the scent of a prolific cheque counterfeiter and con-artist. Pan Am knows about the fraud and they aren't going to look away. Pan Am and the Feds know he is posing as someone in the airline industry, but they don't know who he is. They misidentify him as a young man in his early 30's. Abagnale is not even 18. The Feds realize their mistake, and Abagnale, to lose their scent, becomes someone else, first a medical doctor, then an attorney. And the cat-and-mouse game is on.

Certainly, in retrospect, everything does seem a little too easy, but when watching it, I bought into it, hook, line and sinker, just like I was being taken by a good con artist. A couple of scenes point out he's getting in over his head, particularly a judicial hearing in which DiCaprio, based on some footage he sees on the TV show ""Perry Mason"", starts presenting evidence like a prosecutor at trial. But Abagnale, having not been to law school, doesn't know the difference between a hearing and a trial. This seemed pretty realistic. A similar scene also occurs when he's practicing medicine.

This is just a great joy ride of a film, an incredibly compelling story, and possibly my favorite performance by DiCaprio. The combination of DiCaprio's performance, Spielberg's direction, and the fantastic script keep everything moving, making you believe you've been through this roller coaster along with Abagnale. In modern life, we often want to fantasize being something else, the grass is always greener in the other yard, etc. Frank Abagnale took that idea to the extreme and led a life where he realized his true fantasies.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Entertaining chase movie with all-star cast,43748,reigntall,18 November 2010,"This is one of the greatest ""cops and robbers"" chase movies ever, directed by Spielberg, and featuring an all-star cast.

I'm not a big fan of movies where the main character is a criminal, but this is the exception. DiCaprio is great as always and his character is so clever and likable, that you just want to see how he cons ""the system"" next. The cop chasing him is Tom Hanks. He has a goofy accent, but he is still also likable, even though he gets really obsessed with catching DiCaprio. Christopher Walken is also there for a few scenes as Leo's dad, and he is great as always.

What makes this movie even more amazing, is that it's based on a true story.

It may seem a bit shallow, since it is basically just one man conning the system in creative ways, but it is very entertaining.

10/10",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,fairly entertaining,43626,zfiany,2 November 2009,"It's definitely an entertaining movie with all the decent elements that a good movie should have. Spielberg is there, Hanks, DiCaprio, and Walken acting, and a funny true story.

The movie is evil in one way that makes you attracted to the smartness in tricking people. I've always enjoyed watching this ""crooky"" kind of intelligence and you cannot but notice that even Hanks admired the character of Abignale Jr.

The only flaw in the movie, however, is that though a problem existed in the relationship of the parents, the leading character played by DiCaprio had no other dimensions. I think probably there should have been more work on how the character developed to become that smart, tricky and lovable. Still, DiCaprio is a brilliant actor and hasn't been fairly treated in Hollywood yet.

CatchMeIfYouCan,No kind of everyman,43626,paul2001sw-1,29 August 2009,"The story of Frank Abegnale Jr., teenage conman extraordinaire, should make for an entertaining movie; but in Stephen Spielberg's hands, the story falls a little flat. Partly this is due to the casting of the dull Leonardo di Caprio in the leading role; and partly because the careful reconstruction of the 1960s is too familiar from countless other movies to be interesting in itself. Mostly, however, the film loses impact because of Spielberg's apparent determination to weave boringly quintessential themes into his story; instead of an epic tale of derring-do, at times it unfolds like a dull tale of a kid who loves his family trying to live the American dream. This may or may not be how it happened; but personally, I think there would have been more interest in the movie without the attempt to depict its frankly remarkable anti-hero as some kind of everyman.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Possibly the most underrated film of all-time,43748,MonroeSmile,13 June 2009,"Spielberg is regarded by many as the greatest director of all-time by many, with the examples of Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park just being a taster of his remarkable work. But for me, his greatest achievement is the incredibly underrated masterpiece that is Catch Me If You Can. Sure it didn't win Oscars ( but it was was nominated), sure it wasn't a box office smash, sure it didn't show us the horrors of the past, but it did show us a heartbreaking REAL story, of a boy who couldn't take his parents divorce, who wanted to run away with it all, and frauded the USA out of millions of dollars, being chased along the way, baffling the FBI and the world as to how he could obtain the money, fool the professionals and simply get away with his continuous law-breaking.

Leonardo DiCaprio, who is regularly snubbed in acting, probably because of his outrageous good looks, is the best actor of his generation, without a doubt. His performances in Romeo & Juliet, Titanic, The Man In The Iron Mask, Gangs of New York, are all top-notch, exceptional roles that put many of today's actors to shame. Catch Me If You Can is by far his best performance.

He plays the fraud Frank Abagnale Jr with such depth and realism that you feel almost intrusive on his life, like you know too much about him. We witness his confusion at the divorce, his disgust at his mother's new boyfriend, his despair at not having a proper home anymore. And yet Leo also plays the adventurous teen spot on when it comes to a certain arrogance needed to convince people he's a pilot or a doctor. Also the determination and focus to detail on Leo's face when making fraudulent cheques, degrees etc is quite unbelievable, you really feel that this kid is putting his utmost concentration into these scams because it's his only way to survive, and he's gotta keep on running or he'll go to prison.

Tom Hanks, as always is on top form as a fast-talking FBI agent who lives and breathes his job, and who is on Leo's trail. Understanding of the young kids' obvious trauma at the divorce, Hanks does sympathise, but has to chase him because, as he puts it ""it's my job"".

The chemistry between both Leo and Hanks is very enjoyable, for although they are almost enemies with one chasing the other, in the end they turn out to be the best of friends.

The most intriguing and unique relationship in the film though has to go to Leo and his father Frank Abagnale Sr. played by the eternally mesmerising Christopher Walken. Walken's character is a man who is very proud and when he is in economic ruin he tries to fool everyone into thinking he's the successful man, however the only person he is fooling is himself. He convinces himself totally that lying makes everything better, and this is probably where Frank is inspired to run away from everything and lie his way around the world. It certainly is the case when Leo asks Walken to tell him to stop running, and instead encouraging him to stop, Walken says ""You cant stop"" and then carries on the web of lies his son has spun by asking "" Where are you going tonight? Somewhere exotic?"" referring to Leo's stunt as a pilot. Walken was deservedly Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance which is really quite fascinating.

The most memorable and poignant scene of the film is where Leo learns from Hanks that his father ( Walken) died by slipping on stairs. This is where Leo's talent is really shown, as the pain and anguish fill his eyes in a mixture of disbelief, anger, helplessness, plus feeling physically sick. He slams the chair in front of him, his eyes swollen in tears. But it's just his moans, eyes or facial expression that makes us feel his huge loss, it is his body. Leo's body moves in the strangest ways, almost like he is consumed with grief and reaching out in despair, all in all making it quite hard to watch. I haven't seen anyone put across that kind of emotion since the great James Dean in the 1950's.

Along with the fast pace, great songs from 1950/60's, the atmosphere of that time gone by, a hell of a cast (including brief performances by Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner), Catch Me If You Can is highly entertaining. Boasting a highly unique soundtrack, a truly uplifting storyline, world-class acting and some superb direction, Catch Me If You Can is Spielberg's most underrated and yet best work, and is a film that will become a firm favourite with all who view it.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Catch this one if you can,43687,sme_no_densetsu,18 December 2008,"""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the true story of Frank William Abagnale, Jr. After running away from home at age 16 he became an expert impostor pursued by the FBI for millions of dollars worth of check fraud.

The story is a highly entertaining one. Sure, liberties were taken with the facts but the true story is extraordinary enough that the fabrications don't seem out of place at all. While the story is mainly light-hearted it also shows some depth in dealing with the characters.

The cast is a fine one with Tom Hanks & Leonardo DiCaprio excellent together as pursuer & pursued. Just having one of them would have been great but having both of them together is a rare treat. The supporting cast is also top-notch with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen & Amy Adams all giving memorable performances.

The direction by Spielberg is flawless as usual and the cinematography is a key contributor to the film's vibrancy. The period look is very appealing with close attention to detail and a retro opening credits sequence to boot. Also adding to the film's flavour are the jazzy score by John Williams and a number of well-chosen pop songs from the period.

The fact that Spielberg has directed so many excellent films unfortunately means that some of them get unjustly overlooked. In my opinion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is one such film. That's a shame because it's a fine, fun romp with impeccable production values.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Awesome!,43748,luvbugk615,10 November 2008,"This film has got to be one of my all time favourite movies. Not only has it got one of my favourite actors in (Leonardo Di Cario) but it is an awesome love story. They don't make films like they used to is what i say!It is great how it all comes together in the end! That is what i most love about this film. That you never know what is round the corner. Me, myself, loves all sorts of films. From rom-coms to war films. What can i say? Awesome film. I could watch it over and over again. I've already seen it a billion times and I'm still not bored of it yet! Great acting and great choosing the actors for the parts! I recommend this film to anyone to likes to see a damn good movie. 10 out of 10. Amazing!

CatchMeIfYouCan,A Sincere Con Man Story.,43687,Wilson102,14 October 2008,"I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed this movie. The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. The bond between them is not immediately apparent and it is highly unorthodox, but, by the end, you completely believe the friendship that has arisen before our eyes. The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected. The film definitely delivers, and, other than ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in. I found his work to be the weak link in ""Gangs of New York."" Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again. Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background. This one is certainly unique as it has a retro, yet not dated, feel to it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,One of my favorite just pop-in movies,43718,Minstrelman,22 September 2008,"There are some movies I just put in when I want to be entertained but not have to think too much. I love this movie for that purpose! Not to say that it doesn't cause some cerebral response, but it's just fun to watch! Frank just keeps slipping through all the nooses, and Tom Hanks' portrayal of Carl Hanratty is probably one of the most overlooked performances of his career while being one of his best (and he has some pretty good ones out there).

One of my favorite things about this movie is the opening credits. It's unbelievable that anyone would like the opening credits, but it brings back memories of my early adolescence when I learned to love movies watching the late night showings of Martin and Lewis on Fridays and Saturdays on my local network affiliates. The 60's styling during the opening credits just creates a wave of nostalgia that causes me to really enjoy. And I love the score. It's perfect for this type of intrigue.

The only negative thing that I saw in the movie is the stretch of age that DiCaprio has to pull off. I think he does so on an emotional level, but, physically, it's hard to believe him as a 14 year old at the beginning of the film.

If you haven't seen this one, it's worth the purchase price of the special edition DVD. Grab it before it gets away!",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"Fun, fascinating film",43687,kyle-cruse,16 September 2008,"Based on true story of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played here by Leonardo DiCaprio) and the detective (Tom Hanks) in pursuit of him, ""Catch Me If You Can"" proved to be a fun-filled, fascinating movie. Rather than telling this story as accurately as possible, Spielberg manages to spice it up with tons of little bits of humor and fascinating facts rather than just tell it as a straight story. There is enough humor here for this to be a comedy, from Abagnale pretending to be a substitute teacher to get back at some students who made fun of him to him pretending to be a former graduate from Harvard to impress his girlfriend (Amy Adams) and her father (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, there is a moving story here, dealing with the struggles in this man's life and his family. It is truly a fascinating story on its own, especially the areas regarding Abadnale's high level of intelligence, and it is a story told very well here. The film could afford to be shortened a bit, as it tends to be a little long overall, particularly with the long scenes with Abagnale and his father (Christopher Walken) and other scenes having to do with his family. The recurring Christmas theme is also somewhat unnecessary and not necessarily beneficial. Nevertheless, this is an impressive movie, one of Spielberg's best, in my opinion. Not entirely perfect, but not too far off. Worthwhile for just about anyone, especially if you like excitement as well as great character studies.

CatchMeIfYouCan,This is worth an 11,43748,simon3818,24 June 2008,"I first rented this back in 2004 and thought id give it a go. Now, in 2008, I'm hooked on the story.

This is based on a true story of Frank Abagnale, who became one of Americas daring con men. The story is addictive. He gets up to all sorts posing in a variety of different professions to get by and escape the authorities who are after him as he keeps forging cheques (checks). The antics he gets up to are astonishing as i think many people wouldn't have the nerve to do them - This has taught me a lot about cheque fraud and counterfeiting.

Grab this and the book of the same name. Its amazing in what a young man will do to survive.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,"A funny, yet moving story",43718,I_Love_Spielberg,22 May 2008,"Yet again, another triumph for Steven Spielberg. It's a true story about a boy named Frank Abignale Jr. who becomes a con man, using fake identities and cashing in faux checks. And while this is happening, an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty is on the lookout for him.

What's great about this story is the humor. There is some wonderful play between Frank Abignale Jr. and Carl Hanratty and all of the characters in the film. I especially like Carl's ""Knock Knock"" joke. I won't tell you what it is, but it's very good.

It's truly the sweet dessert that Spielberg has given to us after giving us the bitter herbs of ""Minority Report.""

CatchMeIfYouCan,A little too long but still a great thrill ride!,43718,Sylviastel,27 April 2008,"Frank Abernagle Jr. becomes one of the most successful con artists of the last century. He likes to fool people into believing. If he had studied acting, he would have probably gone very far. Frank is played by Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio and Frank Sr., is play by Oscar winner Christopher Walken. The cast is first rate which includes French actress, Nathalie Baye, as his French mother, Ellen Pompeo before Grey's Anatomy, Kitty Carlisle as herself, and the Oscar winner Tom Hanks. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg. The film is quite detailed about Frank's life conning everybody from his parents to everybody else. The film earned several Academy Award nominations. It's a smart film but it's too long. It does bring back the Pan Am airline legacy even for a little while. Before 1991, Pan Am Airlines was the king of the airlines before it closed down due to poor mishandled financial matters and weak security which helped cause the 1988 disaster. The story ends before Pan Am's image is tarnished.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Very Good,43687,jb-448,6 March 2008,"I really do like this movie. It's got good directing, good acting, good script, suspense, you name it its got it. Tommy Hanks is good as you'd expect and Leonardo Dicaprio puts out his first good performance, (Liked Titanic, dislike him in it). This is a slick movie about a real life conman, who pretends to be many things and endangers peoples lives doing it! Tom Hanks is the cop hunting him down. It's funny how their relationship is portrayed as well. It's quirky and i think Steven used it well. Chris Walken is Leon's dad and as usual puts out a good supporting role.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Spielberg having fun,43687,dromasca,8 February 2008,"Steven Spielberg seems to have had some fun doing this movie, and he is trying to make the viewers feel the fun too. I am no big fan of the true crime stories, but this is the second I saw recently (the other was the more recent 'Zodiac') that I really liked.

The charm of the movie lies mostly in the recreation of the 60s with techniques of the 60s movies and some quotes from the James Bond movies for example, all combined with the fine story telling skills of Spielberg. Added here is the excellent performance of Leonardo DiCaprio which I have quite mixed feelings about generally but who fits here perfectly playing at 28 the role of a teenager who incarnates 28 years old characters. Together with Leo we can see Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, whose relationships with him as the detective following him to obsession and as his father are key in the logic of the character and of the film.

Spielberg is now famous and proved everything he had to prove. In the last ten years he tried different genres, and seems to do a good job in most of them. The one thing that we may lose is who is the real Spielberg, what is this strong voice trying to say. For this we need to go back to the 70s and the 80s, or maybe see again 'Schindler's List'. Between those we may also have some fun seeing a fun movie like this one.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,I just re-watched it,43718,thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw,28 January 2008,"And thought it was better than I remembered it being. I think that it should have won some kind of Oscar. Maybe not for best picture, but maybe and acting award. Oh well I'm not in charge of the Academy Awards (and I don't think many people would want me to be). I thought that the movie was very well done. The story line was great and the acting surpurp. Tom Hanks being my favorite of all time is a huge reason (if not the only reason) I went to see the movie. But after seeing it I fell in love with the whole thing. I will say though after re-watching it the other day, that most flight attendants are that excited about going to work or their jobs (trust me, I am a flight attendant, though I like my job, you would never see me that happy about going to work). Other than that, which I have to say makes me laugh, so I guess I should even with that I thought it was a well done and great movie to see. And I would highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to see it.

CatchMeIfYouCan,terrifically entertaining lite hearted fare from Steven Spielberg,43718,disdressed12,22 January 2008,"Steven Spielberg directed this light hearted ""based on a true story"" crime drama.it's basically about one young man who assumes several different identities while forging millions of dollars worth of checks without the FBI being aware of it.along the way,he poses an a doctor,lawyer and a commercial pilot.once the FBI does catch on to him he manges to stay at least one step ahead of them.this movie takes place in the 60's and in this day and age,a Frank Abagnale would not likely have been successful in forging checks and/or eluding the authorities.Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role of Frank Abagnale.leading the FBI investigation is Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks.it's fun to see the two try to outwit each other,and there are some close calls for Frank,in which he is moments from being discovered.just like in The Terminal,Steven Spielberg shows he is just as skilled with the lighter fare as with the darker subjects he is known for.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Old school fun.,43718,dead47548,8 January 2008,"What starts off as a very entertaining story of one of the nation's biggest criminals becomes a unique character study of a young man running away from not only the law and a dysfunctional family, but running away from himself as well. It explores every facet of Abagnale's life while remaining wickedly entertaining and perfectly stylish (the costume design and set decoration are incredible). DiCaprio gives another knockout performance Hanks delivers what might be my favorite performance of his. Walken and Amy Adams are also quite excellent (as is Jennifer Garner in her cameo). A really fun, enjoyable ride with a lot more under the surface than it seems to have. It's easily my favorite Spielberg and definitely one of the best of 2002. I should also mention that the score is incredible.

CatchMeIfYouCan,The Great Escape Artist,43748,departed07,22 December 2007,"While it was easy for me to believe that Steven Spielberg could direct such pictures such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan or Minority Report where each of those films tackle subjects or showed realism of certain events, Catch Me If You Can surprised me as one of those films where for once he could show the other side of him without losing his touch.

In ""Catch Me If You Can,"" Leonardo DiCaprio is the central character for which he plays William Abagnale Jr., a young man who looks up to his father William Sr. (Christopher Walken) in which all the son observes is how to lie and B.S. people to getting what he wants. In one particular scene, William is at a public school dressed in his old private uniform outfit and fools a classroom in believing that he is a teacher and not just some puny student. The rise and fall from grace starts after William sees his father and mother getting a divorce which leads him to be like normal teenagers in running away from their parents and trying to use his father's wisdom in succeeding by fooling people, especially pretending to be a pilot for Pan Am Airports.

After stealing nearly a million dollars in cash from pretending to be the pilot, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is on the hunt to look for William in which on one occasion, he meets the young man face to face at a hotel in Florida and thinks he has him until he is coaxed by William pretending to be a secret agent.

By using alias names from comic books, William is having different professions from a smoothing playboy, a doctor and a lawyer to get by making ends meet and at the same time falling in love with a girl by the name of Brenda (Amy Adams) who got kicked out by her parents after she got an abortion. Only time will come when young William will be caught and the truth will be revealed.

Catch Me If You Can surprised me as a film about con artists and also a film about identity for which a person can surprise others in the way they present themselves and pretend to be something they are not. In a film with an all star cast from Leonardo DiCaprio proved that he is growing up and leaving all the teeny bop roles behind; Tom Hanks is a mixture of comic relief and drama for which he just wants to make sure that William Jr. is safely caught before getting killed just as Christopher Walken proves that despite playing eccentric characters or people on the brink of insanity, he can play anything smooth.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Amazing...,43687,shadowman123,3 December 2007,"When I checked out the true story behind the exploits of one Frank Abignale Jr, I saw marvelled and shocked by this guy. This has got to be one of Speliberg's best movies but what also makes this film special is that it has his style but all in all without any big CGI or SFX , its just pure magical entertainment which strings you along. The story follows the life of a young man known as Frank Abignal Jr who would go into history as the most audios and yet daring and youngest con men in history conning banks out millions as well posing as several other professionals. Leo DiCaprio shows once again that he is not just a pretty face and he can square of with the likes of Johnny Depp. One thing that is great about his performance is the level of innocence portrayed by him and it is very hard if not impossible to be mad at him . The film moves at a slow pace which I really didn't mind because it introduced you into his world which also mad one build bonds with the other characters which made the movie an emotional one to watch and sometimes painful for me personally through watching my parents having to struggle with their finical situation and how teen against can some times go right out of control. Tom Hanks was good as the federal agent , not his best performances but still very good but Christopher Walken was nothing short of brilliant which begs the question why has not been given an Oscar yet ? My only complaints were that it was a little too long but I was willing to let that go because DiCaprio kept my hooked and a few Hollywood moments added in which I guess kind of distract a slight bit from its inspired by true events angel. To conclude Catch me If You Can is one of Speilbergs best works as well as proving that DiCaprio is not just a pretty face but one of the talent and very respectable actors coming up , highly recommended there is something for everyone in here.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Extremely entertaining,43687,galileo3,20 November 2007,"Catch Me If You Can (2002)

Top 5 - 2002

Spielberg's versatility is yet again proved with 'Catch Me If You Can' as supremely entertaining film with a mix of solid humour and drama.

Leonardo Di Caprio is on the run from the cops, for fraud; Tom Hanks is the man determined to catch the charismatic criminal as he cruises around America, under different names, occupations and personal information.

Christopher Walken plays Di Caprio's father, in what is one of his best performances in recent years.

Spielberg's film combines an enjoyable ride, with wonderful performances and again a vibrant soundtrack from John Williams add to the whole rhythm of this superb film.

This is not a masterpiece, but it has qualities and it entertains constantly. This is one of the best films of 2002

This Movie is the Second Mouse",43748,PeterWilliamson,29 October 2007,"My all time favourite movie. Absolutely brilliant! Definitely Spielberg's best. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my ten favourite actors. Everything I've seen him in, both he and the movie it self have been absolutely brilliant.

Leonardo is Frank Abagnale Jr. Someone who became a doctor, lawyer, an airline pilot and managed to con millions of dollars from the government.

Tom Hanks plays the F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty who is devoting all his spare time to track down capture Leonardo as soon as he can.

Christopher Walken is Frank Abagnale, the father of Frank Abagnale Jr. His son learned most of his skills from his father. His father loves his son, and won't say anything to even hint to his son's location and Nathalie Baye is Paula Abagnale, Franks Jr's mother. She's started a new life and doesn't much care for her former husband, and just wants her son to be safe and not on the run from the government.

This movie is perfect. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Great story + two marvelous actors + a brilliant director -= recipe for entertainment,43718,blanche-2,19 July 2007,"Leonardo DiCaprio is the nemesis of an FBI agent, and vice versa, in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" a 2002 film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on a true story, DiCaprio is the young Frank Abagnale, a great impostor who teaches school, becomes a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer as he floats bad checks all over the country and seems to be impossible to capture.

The film is beautifully paced by Spielberg and absolutely fascinating as you wait and see what Abagnale is going to do next. When his father gets in trouble with the IRS, the family lifestyle changes, and Frank has to go to a public high school. He insists on wearing his private school jacket on his first day. He promptly takes over a French class as the substitute teacher and dismisses the real one, saying there must be a mistake. When he's discovered, his parents are called in. ""Frank has been teaching French for the past week,"" the principal tells them. ""Today he scheduled a field trip to a French bread-making factory. You see my problem."" His father (Christopher Walken) admires his son's chicanery but refuses to take advantage of it, even as his financial state worsens.

Tom Hanks is Hanratty, the FBI agent who chases Abagnale all over the world. He is fabulous as a lonely, hard-working, insightful man who gets a call in his office from Frank every Christmas. ""I know why you called me,"" he says to Frank. ""You don't have anyone else to call."" The two develop a strange bond. The baby-faced DiCaprio does a magnificent job as Frank. He's totally magnetic, charming, and also sad, exhibiting Frank's pain over his parents' divorce and his father's downfall. His goal is to get ""everything back again"" but then it becomes a game he can't quit. As his father, Walken is excellent as a proud man faced with the loss of his property, income, and family.

A well-cast, expertly directed film all the more intriguing since it's based on a true story. The opening scene is Frank Abagnale's appearance on ""To Tell the Truth."" We don't get to see if he fooled the audience, but he probably did - telling the truth is something Frank, while on the run, never did particularly well.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Easily Digestible,43656,raymond-massart,15 June 2007,"Entertaining indeed. Easily digestible: a feel good movie seasoned with a dash of suspense, small-scale drama and the obligatory happy ending. Nothing wrong with the previous assessment apart from the fact that ""Catch me..."" did not entirely succeed in keeping my undivided attention and that I was not really impressed due to an absence of tangible substance in the portrayal of the various characters.All the protagonists seemed to lack a form of real content and appeared to me as being very shallow human beings. Even the chemistry between Di Caprio and his father which was obviously intended by the director, was hardly convincing. In the first half of the movie Tom Hanks was portrayed too often as a bungling FBI agent which bordered on ludicrousness but luckily he was more convincing in the second half. Some scenes, such as the references to James Bond and Di Caprio's amorous encounter in a hotel room, were really superfluous not to mention the viewer's disbelief at the ingenious escapology of the Houdini-like forgerer. As stated in another review: a popcorn movie more or less, with regrettably, in my view, slightly less than more.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,"A mediocre film, with a couple of interesting twists starring Leonardo DiCaprio",43687,scbarlby,14 March 2007,"I had seen this film sitting gathering dust on the shelf of my local store and decided it might be worth giving it a try. It defiantly did not disappoint me as I was sucked into the world of Frank Abanale Jr and experienced his unfortunate and stressful life.

Based on a true story, this film is about a young boy aged 17 who in his lifetime had managed to con his way into millions of dollars. Flipping easily between different jobs from airline pilots to Doctors, to lawyers. Along his way he even managed to run into a bit a romance.

However, I believe that Leonardo did not play his character in a pensive way, as I think he should have. Although he is revelling in his wealth, he should perhaps be a little bit more upset due to the circumstances.

It is an interesting plot line with lots of snaking twists and turns, it is unequivocal to see that a lot of thought has gone into planning this film out, but I must admit that I have seen better films.

During some of the unnecessary scenes in the film I was so bored I realised I had taken better interest in the way the curtain was blowing in the wind, in contrast to the more interesting scenes where I would be literally on the edge my seat in frenetic anticipation.

Overall, the film is generally interesting, and is a definite must see. If you don't like the film I'm sure heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio will catch your attention. (And I'm not jut talking to you ladies!)",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent biopic about a very sly con artist,43748,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,27 November 2006,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, in my opinion, is an excellent biopic about a very sly con artist. If you ask me, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a very sly criminal and con artist. I just can't believe he did it for a stupid reason, though. If you want to know the reason, you'll have to see the movie. However, I could relate to how he was feeling, albeit I didn't do what he did. I would never commit any kind of a crime. Even if I had been set up for a crime, I know someone would get me off the hook. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks make a great team. You're in for a really good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it today.

CatchMeIfYouCan,acting within acting,43656,roedyg,31 October 2006,"This works for much the same reason Shakespeare works with women characters dressing as boys in the play where the original actor is a boy playing a woman. Di Caprio plays a con man who is a consummate actor. Since his skill at conning is identical to di Caprio's acting skill in the movie, his schemes blend seamlessly. His ability to fool people seems completely natural.

The plot whips along at a galloping pace.

Actors like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro seem wasted in this movie. Hanks plays a very bland uninteresting cop. The role could have been played by any balding TV cop.

This is based on a true character. Truth is stranger than fiction, especially some of his escapes.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Catchy if a bit overlong,43626,PeterJordan,9 August 2006,"The premise of Catch Me If You Can is interesting to say the least. The Spielberg directed biopic is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr who pulls of a series of breathtaking and unbelievable but nonetheless credible in their execution scams, and all before his 19th birthday.

However this is also essentially the story of a young man who witness's his fathers business failure and consequently the break up of his happy family life, and accordingly sets out on something of a reactionary and desperate, but unattainable crusade to try and reclaim that which he has lost.

Leonardo di Caprio, in a Michael J Fox eternal youth stereotyping role, stars as the teenager who is pursued over a period of years by an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks who is determined to get his man no matter what.

The movie opens by setting the scene of the relationship between Di Caprio and his father, played by Christopher Walkin, whom the son obviously idolises. Early on we see Frank Abagnale Sr. being honoured by the local Rotary chapter but it soon becomes all to apparent that his success is not as it seems and in fact he is on the verge of bankruptcy and being pursued by the IRS for tax evasion. Things rapidly crumble leading to the Abagnale's losing their house and soon after the break up of the family when his Frank Senior's French wife leaves him for his best friend. Frank Jr, forced to choose between living with his mother of father, instead opts to run away and very soon realises an ability to graft and deceive people, more often than not women, based on his good looks, charm and, as he discovers, the awe and glamour in which the public hold airline pilots in 1960's America.

Frank Jr. starts by breathtakingly impersonating a Pan Am Co Pilot which, more than anything exposes the gullibility and trusting nature of people before an age of air terrorism. Buoyed by his success and the relative ease in which he manages to carry off his assumed role, Frank's rapid learning curve combined with the necessity to keep ahead of the FBI chase leads him to further roles as a James Bond type super cool sophisticate, A Night shift doctor and ultimately a State prosecutor. All through this he keeps in contact with his father holding out the vague hope that he can get his mother and father back together and all will be the same as before and the nightmare will end. As his star continue to rise and his daring reaches new heights his fathers conversely falls as he ultimately ends up working as a mail man to make things meet.

The most striking thing about this movie is how it develops each of the deceptions or roles he adopts, so that we start out finding it hard to see how he can carry off a role when he introduces the concept and yet as we are led through his deceptions the, ease and credibility of his performance and the naivety or unquestioning attitude of his audience carry us along and make us too see how he could have really pulled the trick.

In the end the movie does stretch on a bit in its telling of the story and introduction of additional supporting cast of a love interest and her father played by Martin Sheen so that the end product runs well over 2 hours but if you think you might be on for sitting that long it's worth a look.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Lose the Title Sequence!,43656,gelman@attglobal.net,4 July 2006,"Clever titling sequences are a Hollywood preoccupation. Some are better and some are worse. The title sequence to ""Catch Me If You Can"" is as repetitive and as annoying as any I've ever encountered. It got the film off on the wrong foot as far as my wife and I were concerned. Nevertheless, it is an amusing film with Leonard DiCaprio as the teen-age youth who successfully passes himself off as a co-pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc., while passing phony checks that lead the FBI on a global chase. Hanks is the perfect nerdish FBI agent who eventually catches up with DiCaprio in a tiny French village where his father and mother met during World War II. Stephen Spielberg directs efficiently.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Decidedly average ...,43626,redkiwi,24 January 2005,"Despite featuring the wonderful Chjristopher Walken in another excellent performance, catch me if you can is a decidedly average Hollywood portrayal of the life of a playboy conman.

Matt Damon (cue silly voice from Team America: World Police) is his usual wooden self as he continues his quest to become the new Keanu Reeves of his day.

Tom Hanks is annoying as usual and only some good performances from peripheral cast members and a half decent story hold together and make it watchable.

I'd watch it again, but only if it involved much beer!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Australia,43687,Pro_Surfer_14,1 November 2004,"As I will say again STEVEN SPIELBERG is film making GENIUS!!!!!!! His use of LIGHT in all of his films are mood swingers and tradesmarkes. I adore his photography and brilliant directing in all his movies. In Catch me if you Can he gets a brilliant ensemble cast to for fill this movie eg: TOM HANKS (AGAIN), LEONARDO DICAPRIO and many more... I believe anything script he reads, he reads 100 times before signing on for the project, he checks it for errors and mistakes and also writes his own little comments on the scripts. That is why every film he does is 100% perfect.. As you will notice he uses Tom Hanks in most of his movies, and that my friends is a very good move, because Tom is one of the best actors around and brings passion to all of his films. The basic plot in this movie is about a traumatized teenager (LEONARDO) going through his parents break up. So he goes on the run as a 'CON' and lives the high life for a while, until Tom Hanks Comes Along.. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN IS A SOPHISTICATED TRUE STORY BY THE FILM GENIUS ""STEVEN SPIELBERG"".....

CatchMeIfYouCan,Don't read if the truth offends you,43626,Stu-42,27 September 2004,"This movie was OK. It wasn't spectacular and was on the overlong side. That's really not what you would expect from a big name film with big name stars. I guess I got about what I wanted from it, but to say that it's as wonderful as what I'm reading here is just not accurate. First off, you know you're in trouble when Leonardo Di Caprio is the best actor in the movie. I'm not a fan, but he did do the best job. I like Tom Hanks, how could you not? However, his acting talents are incredibly overestimated. For the first 20 minutes I was having a hard time trying to figure out what his accent was- southern, East Coast or perhaps Australian? Weak. Next, there's the infamous Christopher Walken. Amazing how no one mentioned him in the 20 or so comments I read. Maybe they didn't want to say anything bad about someone so well liked. OK, leave it to me to do the dirty work. Once again I'll bash another extremely popular actor: Walken is a terrible actor and in this movie he actually was a little better than I've seen him- slightly less terrible. I also read that this was totally original and that the ""cat and mouse"" idea was just great. This film didn't have an original feel to me and just off the top of my head I'm coming up with 2 other chase movies that blow this one away: Heat (De Niro) and The French Connection. Sorry to have to burst everyone's ideas, but I can't lie to you. I must also do the unthinkable again; yes, I'm going to say a few words about Spielberg. He has some talent, but his movies are filled with a certain sappy quality that just doesn't ring true or have any relevance. Perfect example- that thing with the floating $ bill that someone said was a nod to Forrest Gump (a forgettable movie to be sure). I guess people like that sort of stuff, but it's just silly and overdone. Well, I think I've ranted enough. I just feel there are many other better movies to get excited about out there. For Tom Hanks fans I still say ""Big"" (1987) is his best. For Spielberg I strongly recommend his first and best effort ""Duel"" (1971). For Walken and Di Caprio fans- you don't want to hear what I recommend.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,the four million dollar man,43595,ThurstonHunger,8 March 2004,"This is a film I admired more than I enjoyed. I'm glad I saw it, and moreso that it was rented from a local library. Worth every penny. Also it strikes me as the kind of film my folks should absolutely see, and will enjoy more than I did.

But I did enjoy it somewhat. I mean it has a pretty fascinating story at its center (I had not read the original book, but might do so later.) In talking to a friend who did read that, or maybe he heard the book-on-tape, it is clear that changes made to the film presentation were significant. More people doing ""based on a true story"" should follow this example, as the changes honestly helped to advance the storytelling desired.

Quest for father, it worked for Joseph Campbell, and it works for Spielberg as well. And speaking of fathers, imagine having the luxury of Christopher Walken in a subordinate role as the absent biological father. I truly enjoy his verb-excising and pause-inserting talent, although it is rare to watch him and not think, ""hey that's Christopher Walken.""

Tom Hanks as the substitute father however is more malleable. I think his Boston accent comes and goes a little bit, but his uptight-as-John-Ashcroft attitude here was welcome...he goes one step further and slowly reveals a humane tenderness that normally does not turn up in such rigid rectitude. Add his absent family adds up in the equation.

Speaking of luxury, imagine having Martin Sheen in a largely disposable role, and Jennifer Garner as your cheap eye-candy. Well at $1000 a 1960 night, she ain't cheap, but you know what I'm saying. John Williams' music was different this time out, and I think stole the show more than Hanks as others allege. It did it with a breezy cool as easy as a snap. I likened it to more like something from Harry Partch meets Lou Harrison, then 60's soul jazz...but it was tremendous. It created as much playful suspense as the film needed all by itself.

Leonard DiCaprio, evidently one of the driving forces behind bringing this to the screen did not work so much for me. But I think a big part of his charisma was built from swoon power, indeed more often than not he's fatally charming some young femme. His Abegnale character rolls up unbelievable amounts of money, and I wonder if the drive of was more sexually sparked than the spiel we get here? A seventeen year-old plus stewardesses?? Smells like motivation.

I imagine it was fun for DiCaprio, or any actor, to play a con man. If we are all actors, maybe when we are being fake we are at our most true. No but, fun to pretend.

A con man relies on not only misdirection but of course, confidence. More emphasis is placed on the former here, especially with the hypnotic talisman of a locket on a necklace.

The story is more ""Amazing"" than all the stories Spielberg did for the TV series of that name lo these many years ago. For me it had some troubles, as a caper film means you have to have a criminal. And making a likable criminal is something that I'm less susceptible to than others.

On top of that, for this to be ""I Was a Teenage Super Impostor"" something did not click. DiCaprio's subterfuge never seemed so meticulously studied. I think we were supposed to buy a combination of some dumb luck and dumber FBI men. The ending intimates that Abegnale's skills were remarkably superior, but this is a film that did not want to get bogged down in the details of the crime.

So the deader the head for this, the more one can enjoy the fanciful flight. The film is glossy, the DVD has some nice input and certainly paints a likewise glossy portrait of Spielberg as a consummate craftsman. And a pretty genial guy. Or is he just a master fake?? No, I'm sure he's a gracious gent, and I think this is a nice oddball in his oeuvre.

Again for my mom and dad, I give this an 8/10, but on my own scale, it scores an even

CatchMeIfYouCan,Some very classy bits to watch out for. Well worth waiting for the video.,43595,danindenver,3 January 2004,"Typical problems of making a good flick on the basis of a true story. Truth seems to sort of stifle the creative juices. Having read the actual story, I'm afraid I had trouble following the movie, at times. It starts out in a French prison, but I don't recall anyone saying why he was actually in prison in France. I thought the movie version of his becoming a doctor was a bit raw and quite abrupt. The true story involved a much more natural flow of events and would have made a neat segment. I guess they needed a certain treatment in order to make transitions from one part of the story to the next. And they did a pretty good job of stitching the whole thing together, even providing (creating?) a background of family issues to explain, in a way, how he happened to get into his chosen lifestyle. Some very classy bits to watch out for. Well worth waiting for on video.

BTW, lest anyone think that Frank's lifestyle would be fun to emulate, you should know that he spent a lot more time in prison than what appears in the movie. In real life, he nearly died in the French prison. And he has been working hard since then to prevent others from doing what he did.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Good Cat and Mouse Movie,43626,Luigi Di Pilla,22 September 2003,"It was better than I expected. Leonardo Di Caprio did as usual a great performance. I liked especially his charme with the girls. I think that Steven Spielberg succeeded finally creating an entertaining cat and mouse romantic thriller after his flops AI and MR. The best thing is that all is based on a true story. The setting of the sixties accompanied by some songs of Frank Sinatra gave me the impression to be in that time. I can recommend it to everyone that likes heist films. It is by far better than ""Heist"", ""The Score"" or ""Oceans 11"". My vote is anyway lightly above average because there is not enough suspense atmosphere. 6.5/10.

The amazing thing is that the movie is based on true facts. If you don't know this the movie seems totally unbelievable and silly. It's great fun to see how Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) commits fraud time after time and impersonated several professions that he is not qualified to. However it feels like some lose events that were glued together in order to make an 2 hours+ movie. I think that the story of the real Frank Abagnale is much more interesting.

The actors are perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for the role and he even manages to play a convincing early teenager, certainly his best role till date. But the one that steels the show is of course once again Christopher Walken. It's wonderful to see him again in a non-psychopath role. Tom Hanks also gives a nice performance however i have seen him done better. Certainly some nice casting work!

Visually the movie is eye candy because of the costumes, sets and especially cinematography.

There are some typical Spielberg things in the movie which makes it worth to watch. Like the comical elements of the movie that are done brilliantly in a way only Spielberg can do. Bad thing is that the movie doesn't seem like one to watch over and over again.

Not a must see but still a fun movie to watch.

How he ever let Abagnale get away from him as many times as he did is beyond me, but then again, based on recent news the FBI appears to be about as bright as Barney Fife so I guess they really did let this kid slip through their fingers on more than one occasion and make fools out of them all.

Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams. Tom Hanks shows up once again (*yawn*) with his typical 'martyr of purity' shtick; I would've preferred less of him and more of Christopher Walken's impassioned (and far more brief) performance as a long-suffering father.

I found myself going to the doctor a few days later and thinking to myself ""what if one of those nurses came out without that white coat on. I mean is the fact they have the coat on that makes you think they're a nurse or the fact they came from behind that door. What I loved about this film and in fact the whole thing was this kid actually did all these things for so long just because people took for granted he was who he says he was.

I have talked to some people who work at hospitals who tell me they wear the white coat not because they are required to but because people give them less problems when they do. I talked to several nurses who told me when they don't have their whites on patients have actually screamed and harassed them out of their rooms cause they though they weren't real nurses and were there to kill them. Cops too, I spoke to several cops who said that when they are off duty people don't stop for them even when they flash their badges. One told me he has actually had several people get off cause they told the jury the badge looked fake, and he didn't look like a real cop. Also several people who have worked at banks tell me they have seen the real guy before as he did several educational films for various banks about how to spot bad checks. Apparently he really was that original when he was young, and after he was caught banks changed security procedures for good. Not many criminal can say their actions changed a industry, much less now work for the industry as experts.

These days people a allot more jaded then when these events took place and people have a more inquisitive nature. But as 9/11 showed us things are still not perfect if really better at all.

My favorite scene in this film is when he becomes the head of the department at the hospital. The two doctors look scared and all he does it what he saw on TV. I think he was watching General Hospital or something, but I am not sure.

I like the acting in this film especially Walken, Hanks character was really drool but from what I heard in interviews, that was the way the guy really is. Leo does well in this as usual. The film is well paced and believable. People can argue about all the things in this movie that are wrong. To me though this movie is about a kid who wants to help his father so he can get back with his mother and they can be a family again. Once he realizes he has gone to far, he keeps going and does what he can to go on with his life. He had one h*ll of a ride though and he knew it. It is a good story that is well told and well acted. When I go to see a film that's what I'm looking for.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,Nice piece of fluffy drama,43656,Agent10,11 June 2003,"This was the first film I have ever seen where I wasn't totally disgusted by Leonardo DiCaprio's presence. Maybe it was the fact that Tom Hanks was in the film, or it was the fact that DiCaprio actually acted well in a role. Either way, this movie was rather nicely done and well put together. The story also proved to be unique enough to grab someone's attention. Steven Spielberg also made a welcome change of pace, getting away from the sci-fi genre for a nice little foray into a light drama. What would have been really interesting was if the real Frank Abagnale was somewhere in the film, considering he looked nothing like DiCaprio. Anyway, this a was a pretty good film overall.

CatchMeIfYouCan,A cute Christmas film about thrity minutes too long,43626,tink-1,6 June 2003,"I, like many proud Jews, find Speilberg to be a total hyporctie and to

top that off, I always get bored in his movies save for private ryan.

However, this movie was fun. It was very lighthearted and Christopher

Walken shines, giving a fabulous performance. Tom Hanks was good but

didnt really impress me and his character was annoying. I thought Leo

was very charming but despite the good performances I began to be

restless, the two and a half hour film could have been about thirty

minutes shorter. Maybe read someone's review who actually likes

Speilberg and his",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,fun but flaky,43565,feeeshboy,28 May 2003,"Spielberg found a great story, but managed to muck it up. There is too much emphasis on the character of Christopher Walken. Spielberg continues his slavish devotion to making the father-son relationship the controlling factor in all of his movies since E.T. Here, it doesn't work, and the far more interesting character of Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is given short shrift.

For a cat-and-mouse game, this movie felt more like a pleasant cruise. Frank Abagnale (DiCaprio) was fun to watch, but there was never any tension built up, and the score reflected this as well. The relationship between Frank and Hanratty was more assumed than developed, and thus a great opportunity was lost. Still, a fun watch, ** out of ****.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Mildly entertaining,43626,smatysia,1 June 2003,"Everybody did an OK job here, but I guess the movie was less than the sum of its parts. The film just fails to engage. I expected more from Spielberg. The plot had Abagnale doing some really dumb things, he would have never been caught otherwise. I suppose these things were supposed to be poignant, but were just really dumb. One example: setting up his print shop in the French town his mother was from. He had five million dollars. He could have gone anywhere. And why did Christopher Walken get an Oscar nomination for this? He is a fine actor, but I didn't think that this role was really worthy. Overall. this is mildly entertaining, but all involved can do better. Grade: C-

CatchMeIfYouCan,A good movie... despite the advertising,43656,thenatureboy,18 May 2003,"When I saw the advertising for this title, I thought I was in for a joyous romp as Tom Hanks chased Leo all over the board. Instead, this was a fairly serious movie. It was way more dramatic than advertised, but still a nice movie. Not a laugh-fess by any stretch, but a pretty nice movie.

P.S. - Walken rules... yet again.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Bit of a drag but still good,43626,AishFan,26 December 2003,"This wasn't as slick as the usual Speilberg films. Coming from such a talented director, I had extremely high expectations and was a little disappointed. I guess I have to take into account the fact that it is based on a true story. Overall, this was a good movie. I just didn't find it enthralling and found some of the scenes a bit long.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Enjoyable but not a memorable classic,43626,Jenny Ho,26 March 2003,"Catch Me if You Can' is inspired by the real life story of conman Frank Abagnale Junior who ran away from home at the age of sixteen following his parents' divorce. His deceit includes pretending to be an airline pilot, doctor and barrister all while he is still a teenager. As he travels around the globe cashing fraudulent cheques, Frank is pursued by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) hence, the taunt in the film's title.

What makes this film an interesting and fun one is that the main character actually exists in real life and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is a charismatic one. Although I found some parts of Catch Me if you Can' enjoyable, I did find it a bit slow and the story-telling flawed. Although one can conclude that Frank was a genius to have deceived as many people as he did, the film is lacking in explanation of how Frank managed to succeed in the range of positions he came to work in, eg how did he become a doctor and barrister without going to either medical or law school?

As a fan of Steven Spielberg's work, I was looking forward to this release and compared to his last two films A.I' and Minority Report', this film is much lighter in tone. Although entertaining while it lasts, Catch Me if You Can' is not the memorable classic that I was hoping for.",pos
CatchMeIfYouCan,not bad,43626,kaiz,23 March 2003,"This is quite an entertaining and interesting movie and also not the typical movie you would expect from Steven Spielberg. It is also much better than Spielberg´s couple of last movies. It has very nice and relaxing pace and gives you kind of a chill out feeling as you watch it. Sixties are portrayed very stylishly and the soundtrack is really good. Christopher Walken is great as usual. He defenitly gives the most memorable performance of this movie. Hanks is okay, nothing special. Di Caprio? Well, I think there are other actors who could have been better but he gets the job done. At least he is not annoying. Not a movie you would remember too much about after 6 months but it has some great jokes and an interesting story. Hollywood entertainment - nothing more, nothing less. 6/10

CatchMeIfYouCan,disappointing execution and little concern for characters,43626,witness-7,22 March 2003,"First, the good news. Christopher Walken fans will appreciate the one gem of his movie -- his supporting performance. After that, there isn't much to hold this movie together.

Leonardo DiCaprio is mis-cast as someone who thrived on their anonymity -- while he happens to be one of the most over-exposed actors in Hollywood. Tom Hanks, along with his role in Road to Perdition, adds little dynamic to a key character -- seemingly taking a parallel to Dan Aykroyd's film career: a once-notable star playing forgettable roles, getting chubby from too much food and sitting on the laurels of former glory.

There are a few moments of interesting character situations, but none of the characters made me care about them (besides Walken). Characters are discarded so frequently in the chase for DiCaprio that the movie seems as shiftless as his character's life. While this conveys the nature of his on-the-run existence, it leads to a film with more of a laundry list of brief encounters rather than any richer storytelling.

There's an attempt to create a surrogate father-son relationship between DiCaprio and Hanks, but it is handled superficially and merely suggested. There's probably more they could have done to bring out an interesting dynamic between these two key characters. More also could have been done to bring out the dynamic of the real father's influence on the son.

The movie employs the classic switch between past and future scenes, but there's no mystery in them other than the mundane details of how they will inevitably connect -- as the audience presumes from the start. A few clever escapes here and there, but they are hardly captivating, let alone memorable.

To its credit, making a story about a fugitive guilty of fraudulent checks is hardly Hollywood sexy these days. But the entire experience left me expecting more from this movie.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Not too exciting,43626,valadas,12 March 2003,"A kid with special talent for cheating and swindling takes it as a way of life after the shock he feels with his parents' divorce. After that there is a succession of forgeries and impersonations some of them a bit unbelievable that take place in a not too exciting development. The kid is not a bad guy after all and has a lot of chances to show his good sentiments. He almost always behaves nicely. The affection developed between chaser and chased (maybe the most important feature of the movie) is not deeply explored. Well the story is a bit lukewarm and makes you sometimes think how is it possible that the kid has not been caught on several occasions. We only believe it due to to the great individual freedom and personal mobility that exist (and existed already in the sixties when the story takes place) in USA with the possibility of people changing their names all the time if they want to, etc.. I think in most European countries that kid would be caught very soon with our much more tight personal controls, mandatory identity cards, etc.. Concerning the acting, Di Caprio is equal to himself as we know him and in my opinion Tom Hanks' real talent is waisted in this movie. By the way a curious note: FBI agents are not shown here as the usual supermen and heroes but many of them as somewhat poor guys and not very bright. Well just a tolerable movie no more than that.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,So very dissapointed...,43595,pariskakas,28 February 2003,"I am a huge fan of Mr Spielberg. I love movies and actually like to learn a lot about movies I watch. Knowing that this movie had great reviews everywhere and has also been a huge box-office hit, I thought it would be great. This is why I ran to see it on the first day it was released here in Greece. I can not teel you how dissapointed I am. And it is not only me, but everybody in the screening were bored to death! If it was half the time it might have been much better. Really sorry Mr Spielberg but don't do this again. Minority Report was also long, but it was great!!!! Hope next time I will see something worthwhile!!!

CatchMeIfYouCan,much ado about nothing,43626,caroletes,26 February 2003,"The movie itself is ok... no big deal though.... I mean if it wasnt with hanks, dicaprio, walken, sheen and directed by spielberg, would it really be this successful?! In my opinion walken was the best actor in this movie. hanks is almost perfect in most of his movie, and dicaprio isn't that bad, but christopher walken totally steals the public's attention (at least my own). If you want something to do on a rainy day and your brain is not working very well, go check it out; otherwise go watch a classic!

CatchMeIfYouCan,Skip the movie -- read the book instead.,43595,wjewilliams@yahoo.com,7 February 2003,"Did I see the same movie 90% of my fellow reviewers saw?

I read the book and perhaps that's why I was sorely disappointed with this film. The film trivialized some of the most interesting parts of the book (the chapter on the French prison was easily the most captivating in my opinion), completely ignored others, and dragged insignificant details out to painful lengths. Leo did an okay job, but I found Hanks grating (not to mention the fact I spent most of the movie trying to figure out why his name wasn't O'Riley, the FBI agent in the book). Walken was good, but I found his character to be very much unlike the man depicted in Frank Abagnale's book.

I was sorely disappointed that the green baby/blue baby joke wasn't even mentioned!

Plus it distorted the whole image of why Frank did the things he did. He, himself, admits that his father's financial troubles were a factor in his actions, but if I remember correctly, he stated much of what he did was hormone-driven -- ie. his affinity for women.

Instead of spending $8 on the film, spend $10 on the book and wait for the movie to be shown on TBS in a few years.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,I've given up.,43626,extravaluepip,6 February 2003,"hi, My names Pip Hodgkinson and before I go any further I'd just

like to say Speilberg is one of the most fantastic directors in this

day and age, but this film is the last straw.

Why oh why can't he end a movie? With AI I was a little upset, but

on a second viewing I was satisfied with the glossy ending. With

Minority Report I was in a world of my own until he went off on his

Brian De Palmer tour of filmmaking! And on a second viewing I

was just as upset that he managed what could have been the

finest film last year look very ordinary with the last 20minutes. So

Catch Me If You Can was his chance of redemption, prove that he

has a little more variety in his abilities as a filmmaker than

constantly not being to end a film (god knows what would have

happened if he'd directed the Ice Storm!) so image my distress

when I'm loving the movie, pleased with the plot,pace and

performances then bang. Theres an ending, but no Steven doesn't

want to leave us with any distaste in our mouths so he takes us off

on a 15minute buddy movie style ending, oh at first they were

against each other then now! the work with each other! Wow didnt

see that one coming. If Minority Reports ending reminded me of

Mission Impossible then Catch Me if you can was Dragnet. Then

he manages to do the most lazy straight to tv trick in the history of

cinema. Oh yeah you got it, he uses the rolling text to make sure

we understand that it IS an happy ending.

So while I celebrated both Minority Report and AI as good films that

could have been great. Catch Me If You Can is not its a disgrace, it

had all the makings of being ten times better than both the before

mentioned films and one of the best films of the year but he

manages to make the film ordinary with its ending. So why should

we praise this movie?

Speilberg is the greatist movie maker for the openings to his films,

take Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones (all three) and now

Catch Me If You Can and you can see a genius at work. But I find it

very hard to find an exceptional Speilberg ending since Jaws?

Surely thats as or more important than the start?",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,Overrated Rough-Cut of a Movie,43626,Napoleon Wilson,28 January 2003,"I saw this movie at the german premiere in berlin. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio appeared and the little girls outside went nuts. All Spielberg had to say about the movie before the screening was ""Nobody dies in this movie."" Hmmm. Anyway, the movie was quite boring. If you have seen the trailer (which was good), you have seen enough. It is always very suspicious when the most interesting part of a story is, that it is based on a true story. The movie gives everything away in the first five minutes and has nothing to add in the following two hours. Camerawork, production value, design, acting - all very high standard, but the movie lacks a heart. Maybe that's because Spielberg was originally producer of this flick and had to jump in to direct it at the last second. It had some nice parts, I smiled sometimes and the characters are sympathetic. But it has big dragging holes in between and it's repetetive. All in all it looks like a rough cut and maybe it would have been better, if they took out another twenty five minutes. Well... maybe not. I gave it a six (out of ten).

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Good Film, Good Story",43595,doned88,14 January 2003,"There's nothing wrong with this film. Acting is as strong as one might expect from people like Hanks, DeCaprio, Walken. The overall film is a good story told by a good storyteller, Spielberg. Not all films can be an E.T., Philadelphia, Lord of the Rings..and when they aren't it's important that they be a solid demonstration of the talents of those involved. Such is the case with this film. Cudo's, however, to Walken who demonstrated restraint from his usual over-the-top Walkenisms and portrayed his character within the story. I think if Spielberg keeps this up, he'll be a good Director (kidding of course).

CatchMeIfYouCan,Excellent.,43626,rupanisp,11 January 2003,"His Divine Grace Very Great Mr. John Williams has created very

good title music.

Titles are excellent.

His Excellency Very Great Director Mr. Steven Spielberg and His

Divine Grace Mr. Tom Hanks has learned very well.

They know American English composition very well.

They know exactly how to write and conduct very good essay.

His Excellency Very Great Christopher Walken has done excellent

job.

For all non-American Directors, Producers, and Actors:

If they want to succeed in American Box Office, then they have to

learn to write their movies in American essay format.

I will recommend taking following courses in American University:

English 1301, 1302 (English Composition), English 2301, 2302 (

American Literature).

Ameican Audience only loves American way of beginning and

ending a essay.

French will have toughest time in American Box Office...

CatchMeIfYouCan,"Light, inoffensive, ultimately forgettable entertainment",43626,cionex,5 January 2003,"Really more of a place for set and costume designers to show off than much of a story. Enlightening in terms of the amount of information available to people today in finance, and DiCaprio and Hanks have a reasonable screen chemistry. The Jennifer Garner cameo's pretty weak, pointless, and forced, and by and large, this is a film you'll be seeing 8 million times on cable eight months from now.

Nothing particularly noteworthy about the movie, and you'll forget the vast majority of it before you leave the theatre, and the rest a few hours later.

CMIYC is watchable and has a few amusing moments, but overall I found it uninteresting and very superficial.

CatchMeIfYouCan,Ehh.,43565,Thanos6,27 December 2002,"**MILD SPOILERS**

I was dragged to see this with the family on Christmas, and it was definitely my least favorite ""present"" of the day.

The main flaw in the film was that of its main character: Frank Abagnale, Jr. I can't support a character being portrayed as a 'hero' if in fact they aren't one. Abagnale had no conscience, no moral center, no concern for all the innocent people he duped and tricked. Plus the film didn't show how he slipped from perfect schoolboy into cold-hearted conman; it just *happened*. If Abagnale had been portrayed as more of a villain, I would have liked the film more. Leonardo DiCaprio's largely sleep-walking performance didn't help.

I give this film 4 out of 10: one point for Tom Hanks's excellent portrayal of Carl Hanratty, one point for John Williams's lovely musical score, one point for Thierry Kuntzel's lovely credit sequence, and one for the ""airport pickup"" gag; you'll know it when you see it.",neg
CatchMeIfYouCan,There are good things but there could have been a lot of good things but????,43595,thesundance14,26 December 2002,"With Steven Spielberg to direct and Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio as stars how can you miss right? Well what should have been either a 100 minute well edited fun movie or a mini-series but at two hours and twenty odd minutes it is way too long and paradoxically not long enough.

You see there are some neat things in this story. What did Frank Abagnale Sr. , wonderfully played by Christopher Walken, do for a living? Was he a printer or just run a stationary store? I mean where did Frank Jr.( DiCaprio) learn about inks and paper and such? It would have given depth to the story and was not there that I saw.

They spent time on Frank Sr's wife and Junior's mother Paula Abagnale played with a wonderful style by Natalie Baye, but was she a hooker in France or was she a money grubbing tramp and the whole divorce scene was played like Junior had not been living there for sixteen years? I couldn't tell for sure.

Spielberg can do better work. Tom Hanks must feel greatly relieved that a picture can be made that he doesn't have to be the mainstay? He was slow to grow on you but ultimately very good as FBI agent Carl Hanratty.

This is sort of fun for a matinee movie but it is not award class. Those who say it is must have seen the director's cut or something? It is an ok movie, but I would have not liked it at full price nearly as much.",neg
